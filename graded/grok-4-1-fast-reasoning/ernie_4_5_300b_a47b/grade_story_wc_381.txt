<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in prophecy, driving ritual choices consistently; interiority concrete via mapping silence. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or flaws complicating peak ritual; success feels competent but unpressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual beats densify hush toward Resonant Reconfiguration; crane glow and crumble deliver on-page closure with felt cost of ongoing solitary duty. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via inward mapping suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brook's edge and fireflies constrain ritual (wing drinks reflection, lights pause/resume); sensory details selective and embodied, mirroring hush. Final firefly dance recharges environment to charge closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early; density escalates via ripple-to-glow under Accumulative lens, narrowing to success with trade-off cost (fragile peace). Agency in placing wing and mapping; abstract chaos limits visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silence-as-force theme emerges organically from ritual particulars, culminating in non-literal resonant hush of prophecy. Wing crumble reweights fragility motif without moralizing; ambiguity in ongoing work invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct poetic texture with perceptual bias (cosmic/earthly noticing hush gaps); stable single POV, rhythmic modulation builds ritual intensity. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion; rhythm varies, syntax supports hush cadence. Minor hush/silence repetition patterned as motif, not loop; figurative coherence despite occasional purple elevation like "tranquil blaze."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami ritual and silence-mapping transforms prophecy trope; hush as active force feels inevitable from particulars. Risky lyric magic heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
