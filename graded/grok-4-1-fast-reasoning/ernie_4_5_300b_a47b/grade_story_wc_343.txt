<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's curiosity drives consistent micro-choices like tracing squares and leaping, earning her change against captain's opposition. Internal conflict is mild, lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; embodied emotions lean toward stock phrasing like "breath caught."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: board discovery → deciphering → starling split → leap into portal (DC) with cost in risked fall and captain's fuming. Single scene fits defaults; orientation anchors early in airship and plains. No lens ambiguity; closure cost legible in "images flooded her mind" and triumphant return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Airship creaks, starlings swirl, hopscotch patterns constrain Lira's choices and charge portal reveal; sensory hierarchy (visual starlings, tactile board) reflects her priorities. Setting evolves causally with dawn and bird split. Micro-setting like phrasebook integrates via action; body in leap charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart discovery) tightens causally via board patterns narrowing to portal leap, driven by Lira's agency; cost felt in void fall and ignored captain. One reversal (murmurations part) forecloses skepticism. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity unlocking hidden truths emerges via board-to-portal arc, reweighted in visions of "light and darkness danced"; subtext in Jax's softening and captain's irrelevance avoids tidy moral. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (constellation alignments, bird screams as encouragement); dialogue natural, goal-driven (Jax pressures but yields), distinct idioms. Rhythm modulates in leap tension; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose propels with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in metaphors ("handwriting slanting like a storm front," "screamed as if urging") slightly dulls peak deciphering without muddling closure. Density high, no loops or scaffolds; clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hopscotch-as-map to portal via starlings transforms portal trope organically through Lira's specifics; fresh synthesis of birds, board, luminance feels inevitable. Bold leap risks heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
