<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's desperately jocular laugh as desperate bark evolves credibly to genuine grin-bridge at end, earned by rock-debt motivation and ghost surge; contradictory impulses (swallowed joke under pressure) act in scene without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as ritual density builds to CR closure in ghost's "loneliness is a language" and empty hand, reconfiguring premise with reciprocity cost; orientation anchored in first paragraph, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivy pulses/shivers as micro-setting constrains ritual lever-placement and charges lighter ivy/station image at closure; sensory hierarchy (squishing mud, keening rock) filters through Elias's desperation bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant loneliness-cure stake signaled early tightens via rock-keening and ghost confrontation forcing stance crystallization; connection surge as agency-driven deepening shows felt chest-relief cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reciprocity theme emerges organically from rock-ghost balance, reweighted in conductor's "space between" without moralizing; final "catalyzed a conversation" image resonantly answers plague rumor non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable Elias-limited POV with perceptual signature (boot-crack tracing); Lira-Elias dialogue idioms distinct (mischief vs. desperate bark), subtext-driven without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion peaks in "ivy began to shiver... rock flared" without loops or artifacts; figurative density (bruised sky, pulsing ivy) pattern-taught, supports closure image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moon rock catalyzing station-ghost reciprocity transforms loneliness trope via rumor chains and polite anarchy; fresh synthesis inevitable in "conversation" CR, risk heightens surreal stakes coherently.</comment>
