<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via muscle memory and embodied sweat/breath on pivotal node fix; contradictory impulses in burden vs. covenant realization earn final endurance with felt cost. Mother's legacy anchors reflection without flattening pressure. Micro-choices with buckle reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern disruptions accumulate density to spiral realignment closure (RR/Charged Poise) with ongoing burden cost legible in "work was never done." Orientation anchored early (Kael's task in arbor). Single scene causality via buckle-node linkages tightens options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent veins, mossy nodes, and bark vibrations constrain buckle choices and charge final steady glow image. Sensory hierarchy (vibrations over visuals under stress) reflects POV urgency. Micro-setting (buckle as tool) evolves tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert unraveling) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via jagged disruption to multi-node fixes narrowing to acceptance. Agency in muscle memory clicks forces trade-off (sweat, deeper trek). Cost unmistakable in exhaled relief and perpetual watch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Trust-as-language theme emerges organically from buckle presses and pattern song; final "he’d finally learned to speak it" reweights burden non-literally with ambiguity of endless revision. No moralizing; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (fractal light, tremors); rhythmic modulation accelerates in "fingers dancing over bark." Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., buckle press advances plot/action/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in repeated "soundless echo" but pattern-taught. Closure image clear, propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pattern-seeking fantasy with parachute buckle as binary key transforms tropes; risk in soundless/muscle memory mechanics heightens ingenuity without gimmickry. Inevitable hindsight from mother's covenant premise.</comment>
