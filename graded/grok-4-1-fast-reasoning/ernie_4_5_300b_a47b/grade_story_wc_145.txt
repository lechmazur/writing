<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clara's dry wit and confidence embodied in grin to Jorn and persistent trek under pressure; motivation to probe river "reasons" drives micro-choices like packing salinity vial. Internal conflict subtle in faltering wit at "Singular Convergence." Minor flaw: epiphany at ice glow feels slightly unearned without prior contradictory impulse acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density (condensation to rivers to light veins) tightening to CR closure: "Maps are lies" reweights premise with chase-not-catch cost in final drawing image. Mosaic shards legible with falcon/map anchors; orientation clear by para 2. Years-later jump loosens causality slightly without new pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen lake and pitted ice constrain trek/chipping, charging climax glow; condensation patterns recur to mirror rivers, biasing Clara's atlas-editor perception. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under crisis (groan, hiss, ripple). Final outpost window recharges motif purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (river origins/reasons) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via map-trek-glow discovery narrowing to light-as-source realization; agency in chipping ice forecloses geological premise with raw-voice cost. Jorn's pressure coherent but secondary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of maps-as-frayed-promises/lies emerges via particulars (singed map, glowing veins, blank page); final image offers non-literal answer—chase truths—with ambiguity lingering in falcon's absence. No moralizing; resonance from flawed pursuit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (river-pattern bias); voice texture lyrical yet grounded, modulating rhythm in trek (breath plume, pages flap). Dialogue natural/subtextual: Jorn's "You'll die" vs. Clara's retort reveals status. Minor filter-verb stacks in reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (falcon streak, chipping echo); rhythm varies with stress (short crisis sentences). Purposeful repetition (tracing finger) avoids loops. Slight purple in "falcon laughed" jars closure poise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: rivers birthed from earth-bone light/convergence transforms explorer trope via atlas-editor lens; final blank-page draw inevitable from map-lie reweighting. Risks mosaic jumps coherently without gimmick.</comment>
