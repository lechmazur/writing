<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kael's contradictory haste-patience impulses act vividly in the failed attempt ("cursed softly... 'Patience'") and earned change via steady hands, but elders/acolyte exert minimal crucible pressure on his arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of moon mappings and filings builds to on-page DC closure in viaduct shudder and grid alignment, with felt physical cost ("back ached") legible at dawn surge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen lake's thickening ice and roof fissure beam constrain pivotal alignment choice, charging final thaw image; sensory details (hum as heartbeat, crunching boots) filter through Kael's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unyoking via patience) tightens accumulatively through failed haste to night's persistence, narrowing options with ache cost; agency in fractional adjustments drives escalation without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of patient reorientation emerges organically from filings' debate and viaduct lullaby, resonating in acolyte exchange without moralizing; final horizon widening reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-POV perceptual signature shines in "filings trembled, not in fear, but in anticipation"; rhythmic modulation under stress, minimal dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax in night work beats; minor template repetition in filings "coiled... straightened... coiled" purposeful but nudges down slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ancient magnetic relic, lunar fractals, and patience "dance" transforms trope organically; moon-node alignment turn inevitable from particulars.</comment>
