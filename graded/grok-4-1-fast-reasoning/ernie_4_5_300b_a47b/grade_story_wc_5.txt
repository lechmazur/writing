<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Solid interiority via embodied patience (fingers ache, breath fogs) and micro-choices under cold; motivation consistent and intensifies via past failures recalled mid-process. Earned realization at touch ("starlight surged") forecloses impatience path with felt physical/emotional cost. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: deliberate actions build density to plate's hum/glow as RR closure with legible cost (prior losses, trembling finger). Single scene, orientation anchored early (orchard/crater by para 2). No lens ambiguity; final wrap/reprise reconfigures stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard constrains via discarded twigs/apples mirroring constellations, charging seal and final image; cold sharpens senses selectively (breath clouds, creaking trees). Micro-setting (dead roots yield plate) guides discovery. Sensory hierarchy fits patient POV; no generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seal starlight for heart-maps) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via pattern-building/hum to surge; agency in meticulous choices narrows failure option. Cost visible in aches/past losses, felt at "chest heaving." One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of stillness mapping heart emerges via particulars (twig patterns, starlight flow); final realization ("guide to the heart") non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in orchard's "moving stillness" motif charges closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (measured pauses, cold-sharpened senses); rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate to surging ("lines shifting... pulse with life"). No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short sentences at glow surge); minor loops in "deliberate" repeats (−0.3) but voice-motivated. No scaffold in peak (plate touch); strategic telling of backstory anchors present. Clean grammar, strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemist trope with starlight-heart maps via orchard detritus; risk in solo meditative arc heightens stillness stakes organically. Ingenuity in pattern-mirroring seal turns familiar fantasy into specific conceptual payoff.</comment>
