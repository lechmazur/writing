<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Embodied emotion peaks in fingertip tingling and root-image surge, revealing curiosity under pressure; micro-choices like sextant dismantling align with methodical traits, but contradictory impulses feel understated, limiting peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure—"even in decay, there was beauty"—reweighting sorrow via tree memories; pin sounds tighten cadence, with cost in "work was never done" felt on final page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tree roots constrain and charge final guiding walk, evolving from borders to glowing corridor; moonlight sensory filter mirrors grief absorption without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Density escalation via pin proximity and wall shimmer narrows to deeper entry under Accumulative lens; ongoing maintenance cost legible, but stakes lean atmospheric over visceral trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final root surge and smile offer non-literal answer to sorrow's quantification, recharging prior light-bending motif organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature biases toward quantifiable grief in stone/light; rhythmic shifts with storm heighten texture without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action with image, rhythm varies for propulsion; minor "sorrow" paraphrase churn in reflections slightly dulls mid-section without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sextant-to-dream-map synthesis transforms labyrinth trope via quantified sorrow; meditative solo risk heightens conceptual stakes inevitably.</comment>
