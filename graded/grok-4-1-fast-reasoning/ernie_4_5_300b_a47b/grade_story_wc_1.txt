<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in glass artistry and post-survival hollowness propel micro-choices like palm-to-frost; realization of purpose feels earned via prior adaptive traits. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses—realization unfolds sequentially without peak ambiguity—caps below 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via frost-led discoveries tightening to shard hologram's CR: "In the pauses, the truth breathes" reconfigures purpose with conceptual cost of foreclosed prior art life. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single deepening suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Canyon frost and crevice constrain choices—crawling, pattern-reading—and charge final image of "boots crunching frost" mirroring ledger lines; sensory selection (cold seep, damp smoke) reflects artist's perceptual bias. Meets 9+ test via environmental constraint and closure recharge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose discovery) escalates accumulatively through frost convergence to chamber payoff, narrowing hollow survival to charged poise; agency in retracing shows via pattern-following with felt cost of prior frayed creativity. One tightening forecloses old path legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of hidden patterns/pauses emerges organically from frost-led events to final art reconfiguration, resonant in "etch her existence into the world’s quiet intervals" without moralizing; counter-reading of smuggler's depth adds ambiguity. Final image reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature in pattern-seeing (auroras, veins); voice modulates rhythmically from hushed fogged breath to resolute crunching. Prose texture distinct, diction artist-specific without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyricism—e.g., "tiny prism splitting the dawn"—propels via varied syntax; minor overwrite in opening metaphors ("trapped auroras," "liquid swirls") borders density check but patterns taught early without closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glasswork-frost holograms transforms survival trope into pattern-cartography epiphany; frost-as-map ingenuity grows from artist's traits without derivative echoes.</comment>
