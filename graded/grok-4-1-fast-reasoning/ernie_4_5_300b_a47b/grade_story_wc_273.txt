<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in brother's eclipse vanishing drives ink ritual and tower entry; serene anger embodied in unorthodox spill and pursuit against elders' warnings. Minor detachment from "consciously wild intuition" abstraction, but micro-choices under pressure reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: drone trace → ink spill → hologram tower → palm on door as Charged Poise closure with memory-loss cost legible in "vanished forever." Orientation anchored early; single tightening suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Wind and sand constrain ink patterns revelation, charging hologram; desert ozone and shifting boots evolve tactilely to tower door, mirroring fragmentation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (brother/time anomaly) tightens via ink's brother-face glimpse narrowing to tower commitment; agency in spill and entry forecloses retreat with felt vanishing cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ephemeral ink/child circles emerge theme of fragmented time as readable crisis-language; tower entry reweights as mirror without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature in pattern-tracing; girl's dialogue subtextual ("like breath") advances stakes rhythmically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion varies with intensity, ink scene dense without loops; minor figurative density ("fractal spirals") enhances without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ink-wind ritual transforms quest trope freshly; tower hologram as real myth risks bold synthesis charging closure.</comment>
