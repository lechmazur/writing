<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between revolutionary fire and poetic endurance, embodied in the shard's "sharp as regret" and final garden poise; micro-choices like draping mirrors reveal values under pressure. Earned renunciation of full rebellion for subtler revolution carries visible cost. Minor flaw: occasional diagnostic phrasing like "burnished with sorrow" borders therapy-speak but ties to voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shard to storm vision ("city not of spires but of roots") to fungi bloom, culminating in CR via final shard-as-promise image with conceptual cost of partial victory. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening via planted seeds pays off coherently. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid's temporal storms and cobalt haze constrain choices (mirrors as conduits force covering plan); fungi caps mirror shard etchings, charging closure. Sensory hierarchy (prismatic light, humming shard) reflects Kael's priorities; spatial choreography clear in atrium storm. Final garden evolves setting causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose Luminari fraud) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via devised plan, storm glimpse, fungi proof narrowing Council options. Agency in pre-storm seed-planting forces trade-off (heresy accusation); cost legible in "seed of doubt, a fungus of revolution." Coheres under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths emerges organically via mirrors/fungi/shard progression, reweighting Luminari myth in final image ("Civilizations... built on the courage to see what mirrors hide") without moralizing. Subtext in poetic absurdity charges resonance; no Thematic Echo. Protagonist arc inextricable from reimagining question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (poetic refractions like "sharp as regret"); diction/rhythm modulate intensity (short storm sentences vs. reflective close). Single dialogue line ("You see?") natural, goal-driven; no head-hopping or withholding. Voice as character: syntax mirrors burnished sorrow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density (e.g., shard "refracting... danced across twisted spires"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts—read-aloud propulsive. Figurative language purposeful (cobalt haze, fungal symbols) without muddle in peak storm beat. Zero paraphrase; opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: temporal mirrors + bioluminescent fungi DNA history transforms archaeology trope into poetic revolution; risk-taking in absurd plan heightens stakes. Final CR inevitable from shard motif; no derivative echoes, bold conceptual integrity throughout.</comment>
