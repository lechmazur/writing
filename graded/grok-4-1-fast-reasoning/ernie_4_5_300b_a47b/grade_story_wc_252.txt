<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, like clutching the scrimshaw despite scoffing at tales; earned change at detachment forecloses attachment path with felt cost; minor slip in late epiphany phrasing ("understood now") borders therapy-speak but doesn't flatten prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup to Conceptual Repricing closure at "scrimshaw sank... island trembled," reweighting attachment premise; cost legible in fracturing rock "slipping like tears"; orientation anchored early at fringe, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe as micro-setting constrains swim choice and charges final breakout image; sensory details (wet sand, kelp sway, bioluminescent flicker) filter through dock worker's familiarity; coherent spatial choreography from shore to deep.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of detachment signaled early via whispers/violence; meaningful tightening at whale encounter narrows to scrimshaw act under accumulative lens; agency-driven escalation with on-page cost in island's loss alters options legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of freedom-through-detachment emerges organically from scrimshaw/island images, resonant final swim reweights without moralizing; earned via particular struggle, avoids platitudes; subtext in whale nudge layers combative release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of sea-haunted dock worker (waves lapping ankles, fluid swims); rhythmic modulation builds to climax; no dialogue, purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, syntax varies with urgency; minor overwriting in metaphors ("kelp... dancers," "shockwave of clarity") during peak swim slightly muddles but doesn't obscure closure; no loops, clean grammar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scrimshaw talisman dissolving into eco-mythic island erasure transforms tropes; risk in liminal whale communion heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from early whispers to liberated swim.</comment>
