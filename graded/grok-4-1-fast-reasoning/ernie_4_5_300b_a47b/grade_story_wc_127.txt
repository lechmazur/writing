<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to fuse insight with empathy drives precise actions like vial selection and warning of balance cost. Internal consistency and professional detachment shine in client exchange; minor tell in "motivation was not mere profit" but embodied elsewhere.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to client arrival and sale. Charged Poise closure via petal cased and readiness for next client, cost legible in "half truths... linger" line reweighting craft's balance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber grotto's static charge and electromagnetic field constrain blotter/orchid use, charging final petal-casing image. Sensory selectivity (hum, glow, moss) filters through Elias's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of balanced emotion-craft tightens via Lira's "forget" request forcing trade-off vial with joy cost. Agency in her test and acceptance; felt price in hesitation moment alters transaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Half-truths theme emerges via vial balance and "interpretations" line, resonating in final image without moralizing. Subtext in Lira's widened eyes and clearing expression invites ambiguity on partial forgetting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with Elias perceptual bias (static sensing); voice texture poetic yet precise. Dialogue subtextual in "only as much as truth itself," advancing sale naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (build to chime, breath after sale); density high but minor overwrite in opening metaphors slightly slows peak. No loops; propulsion clear to ending image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scent-emotions, static-sensing craft, and half-truth philosophy feels organic. Grotto-static premise transforms dealer trope, risking fantasy tone paid off in closure.</comment>
