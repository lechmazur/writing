<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lira's dual allegiance creates internal contradiction shown in the heavier chip's weight and her shift to amplify vendors' code, earning the final stance; Jax applies targeted pressure without overwhelming. Minor slip in stock "flicker of hope" at close, but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: mural symbol → Jax talk → reorganization plan → Council confrontation → retreat with "fight wasn’t over" as Charged Poise RR, cost legible in ongoing mist retreat. One tightening via plan reveal suffices; orientation anchored by opening skyline/rafts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurrent chip constrains choices (tracing mural, anchoring campaign, final pocket slip) and charges closure image; Alley of Whispers/mural graffiti guides resistance tactics with vivid diesel-fried dough sensory filter via Lira's orderly bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (carnival soul vs. privatization) tightens causally via symbol deadline → reorganization → Council face-off, agency in Lira's map forces trade-off with "dual allegiance" cost felt at barge retreat. Escalation coherent, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Chaos/order theme emerges organically from graffiti-as-map turning rebellion into purpose, final chip pocket reconfigures dual allegiance without statement; resonant via vendor solidarity murmur.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (symbols as "order" in chaos) with biased noticing; dialogue natural/subtextual (Jax's "madwoman" tests plan), rhythm modulates to peak at Council scoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "traced the chip along the mural’s border" advances plot/setting/character); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, propulsion peaks cleanly at confrontation without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of graffiti-code resistance in raft carnival transforms gentrification trope via visual map payoff; risk in reinterpreting "vandalism" as strategy feels inevitable from symbol decoding.</comment>
