<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority via concrete embodiment like "hands trembled" and "mind a sparkler of curiosity," with skepticism yielding to alignment via micro-choices; minor slip in "quietly enthusiastic determination" feels label-ish but doesn't undermine earned change at coin selection and palm placement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: holograms coalesce from static to spiral vision, tightening to distillation protocol with CR closure ("wavelength surged through him") and felt cost of shed doubt; orientation anchored early in observatory intro, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ambered deck's hum, shimmer, and console constrain choices (dial adjustment, coin placement) and charge final levitation/surge; sensory hierarchy via Kael's sync sharpens holograms, mirroring internal alignment without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel prophecy/align) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via coin circuit insight narrowing to distillation with agency and legible cost (doubt shed as "stardust"); charges final image without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of harmonizing chaos emerges via static-to-signal progression, resonant in spiral/non-literal answer without moralizing; coin-tower/moon circuit reweights particulars organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (cosmic bias in "cold draft from future"); rhythmic diction modulates to peak surge, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax in hologram beats; minor overwriting in opener metaphors ("time pooled like honey") and one paraphrase loop on static bursts deduct without touching closure surge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coins as multiverse circuit enabling alignment in contracting cosmos; transforms prophecy trope via tactile console ritual without derivative templates.</comment>
