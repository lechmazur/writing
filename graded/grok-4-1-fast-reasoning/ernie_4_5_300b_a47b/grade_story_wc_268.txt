<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in family legacy drives consistent actions like deciphering messages and hurling the pellet, but lacks contradictory impulses or embodied internal conflict during climax; Veyra's competence shows no genuine struggle or blind spots compounding pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore progression from deciphering riddles to pellet activation at convergence delivering on-page Decisive Change (illusion sundered) and Resonant Reconfiguration (chamber's graceful collapse revealing sky); orientation anchored early in temple library; one tightening at trapdoor suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rickety ladder and mosaic trapdoor constrain access, forcing pellet use as micro-setting that charges final sky-reveal image; sensory details like humming air and glowing rune selectively mirror Veyra's purpose without tourist catalog; spatial choreography coherent from aisles to dais.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmask pretender) signaled early tightens via convergence deadline narrowing options to hurl at climax; agency in pressing pellet and throwing drives escalation under causal lens, with pretender's revelation as visible cost, though guards add minimal complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth sundering deceit emerges organically from pellet's activation peeling away illusion to empty throne; final "graceful collapse" image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting legacy premise without moralizing; irony in courtiers' shift from adoration to recognition adds subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward riddles and runes; poetic diction like "whispering secrets" fits fantasy voice modulating to commanding "Behold the truth" at peak; minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short punchy sentences at hurl ("It arced... struck"), building propulsion; high density in library navigation weaves action and image without loops; minor figurative density ("burned like a star") purposeful, not muddying climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ingenuity in iron gall pellet as illusion-sunderer transforms usurpation trope via rune mechanics and library riddles; fresh synthesis of celestial pause and graceful collapse feels organic; no close famous echoes, but risks mythic archetype without bold subversion.</comment>
