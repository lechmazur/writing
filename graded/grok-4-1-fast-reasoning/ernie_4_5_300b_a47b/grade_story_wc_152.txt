<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zara's micro-choices, like pausing to watch the flame and directing Jaxon, reveal a hierarchy of values blending artistry and subtle rebellion; Jaxon's perceptual shift from foolishness to wisdom earns relational change with felt cost. Internal conflict emerges in trembling fingers amid known coup signs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to on-page CR closure: flame under embroidery unravels galaxy into straight line, reweighting truth with conceptual cost legible in "hidden in the seams." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Candle as recurring object constrains choices (brought closer, held under silk) and charges final image; autumn winds rattle windows, mirroring internal tension and pressuring revelation. Sensory details selective via Zara's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving cosmic truths amid coup signaled early, escalates via textural density to flame test narrowing options; cost felt in heavier shadows and foreclosed decorative facade, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths emerges organically via embroidery patterns shifting meaning; final image non-literally answers "truth is never a straight line" with resonant reconfiguration, embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited to Zara stable, perceptual signature in cosmic-stitched noticing; dialogue natural/subtextual (Zara's chimes laugh evades direct rebellion), advances Jaxon's arc.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with metaphors integrated into action (needles as comets advance craft); rhythm varies, no loops, though opening figurative stack borders overwrite without harming propulsion or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroidery as rebellion code and flame-synchronizer transforms tropes; galaxy chart's unraveling turn inevitable from prior particulars, bold cosmic-political fusion heightens stakes.</comment>
