<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion (hairs rise, tremor in chest) and micro-choices (steady hands despite fear) reveal values under pressure; final renunciation of dynasty power earned via visions. Minor slip: childhood gnaw feels stock, not fully particularized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: crank turns build density from groan to peak hum, yielding visions and compartment reveal as CR closure with emotional cost legible in tears and rebirth resolve. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recurring gramophone crank and desk constrain choices (groove trigger); golden shadows evolve from deepening to softening, charging final image where room shifts from tomb to cradle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth) signaled early; escalation via hum intensification narrows to discovery under accumulative lens, with agency in turning crank and pressing groove. Cost felt in gasp and tears foreclosing vengeful clinging.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial silence emerges from visions and letters, reweighted in final image of shadows as cradle; protagonist arc inextricable, resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature in sensory bias (vibrations in bones, pulsing etchings); rhythmic modulation under stress (hum peaks with short, piercing sentences).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful lyricism (liquid gold shadows) taught early, no loops. Minor overwriting in "standing waves... bend time" risks muddle but coheres.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Gramophone frequency as memory-revealer transforms legacy trope via standing waves ingenuity; fresh synthesis of sound-science and dynasty erasure feels inevitable in compartment click.</comment>
