<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in silence flavors, with contradictory impulses in clinging to trellis versus returning. Doll loss forces micro-choice revealing values, earning final endurance with cost. Father's brief pressure via warning adds crucible without overwhelming single-POV focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of silences building to CR closure in sprout image, reweighting loss with conceptual cost ("doll’s loss had planted something new"). Orientation anchored early (bunker, inversion). Single tightening via doll slip suffices; time jump handled as reflective shard without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (rust taste, honey silence) filtered through Lila's bias, with trellis constraining climax cling and sprout charging final image. Details purposeful, integrated into action. No white-room; spatial choreography clear in hatch/float/cling sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect silences vs. confinement) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via exposure risk to doll loss tightening options. Agency in hesitation/cling, cost legible in forfeiture. One deepening (gilded hush tasted) coheres pressure to Charged Poise at sprout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of growth from confined silences emerges organically via doll-to-sprout reprise, reweighting premise without statement. Final image answers "stretching fears" non-literally with undeniable conceptual cost. Subtle ambiguity in hope lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in flavored silences; voice texture modulates rhythmically (short countdown sentences build tension). Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven. No head-hopping; diction POV-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm passes ear test; no loops or heavy artifacts dull propulsion. Minor overwriting in "intangibly tangible" repeats tolerated as voice-motivated pattern. Closure image crisp, no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi inversion with lyric silence-collection transforms confinement trope; xenial trellis and flavor stakes feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky poetic conceit heightens stakes coherently. Doll-sprout arc non-obvious yet organic.</comment>
