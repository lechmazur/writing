<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in family backstory, driving concrete micro-choices like stealing the vial and exhaling unspoken words, with embodied contradiction in her pounding heart and braced nod. Thalos applies pressure via interruption then revelation, forcing her adaptation. Minor slip: backstory tell ("born from the way her mother’s quiet grief") borders BRR limit but anchors present hum without flattening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via sensory density to CR closure: vial glows steady as village feels warmth, reweighting "whispers slip through cracks" with tears/rain cost on-page. Orientation anchors lighthouse/Elara by para 2. One tightening via Thalos's garden reveal merges stakes without breaks; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens via Elara's herbal bias: oilskin creak, garden scents constrain vial placement on windowsill for dawn rays, charging final glow. Atmosphere tensions bruised sky/ghost storm with rain patter mirroring internal ache. Recurring cobalt tower/pots evolve with events, no white-room; body/tool (vial, sprig) constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers > shouts) signaled para 1, tightens accumulatively via Thalos interruption/support, narrowing to merged garden-hum attempt with village response as deepening. Agency in exhale/hum forecloses doubt path; cost felt in tears as proof crystallizes. Entry to 8+ via trade-off legibility, but subtle village cut lacks direct on-page pressure test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (intent as whisper-current vs. shout-noise) emerges via particulars: vial hum, jasmine sprig, sea churn to village warmth, reweighting premise in final image without statement. Subtext in Thalos grin/silence carries ambiguity of unseen proof. Resonance from Elara's arc inextricable, no moralizing; quiet CR pays off.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in vibration/scent bias ("hum building in her chest"). Dialogue natural/subtextual: Thalos's "Aye" idiom vs. Elara's interior poetry distinguishes voices. Rhythmic modulation peaks in "silent scream of tenderness"; no head-hopping, elision taught via herbs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sense/pressure (e.g., "breath laced with every unspoken word"). Rhythm varies, no loops; figurative coherent ("fisherman coaxing trout") serves voice. Minor overwriting: stacked metaphors in opening ("bled gold into bruised sky") risks muddle but doesn't touch closure; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vial cork + vibrations transform lighthouse trope into fresh intent-science via scents/hums, with Thalos garden as non-obvious synthesis. Risk in village cut-off heightens stakes via unseen reach; inevitable hindsight from early "whispers travel farther." Bold conceptual integrity without retreat.</comment>
