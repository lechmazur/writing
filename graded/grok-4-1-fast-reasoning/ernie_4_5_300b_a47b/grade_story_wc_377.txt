<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve wonder drives consistent actions like tuning and building, rooted in her vow and mute choice. Interiority feels poetic yet embodied through sensory tuning and faint smile. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal beat, like the ice discovery, keeping it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ice discovery builds density to sculpture's performance, culminating in Charged Poise RR at "the sculpture shuddered, then stilled... Elara struck a bell." Cost legible in melting ice and transformation. One tightening via fragment's pulse matching bluff suffices; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bluff's mist, wind, and stones constrain choices (e.g., mossy steps descent, wind chimes); iceberg's chill and pulse charge sculpture build and final image. Sensory hierarchy (hum, glisten) reflects Elara's priorities. Recurring obsidian pedestal integrates action seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder via audible truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as ice shrinks, forcing build and performance under melting timer. Agency in crafting pendulums/chimes; cost in fragment's essence woven away, charging final chord. No live option foreclosure at peak, but coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of releasing wonder emerges organically from bells-ice-symphony progression, reweighted in final "promise" chord without statement. Returning glisten/droplet shifts from discovery to closure cost. Invites ambiguity in world's "hollow echoes" vs. bluff's harmony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: harmonious noticing (bronze curves hum, notes ripple like liquid light). Rhythmic prose modulates from quiet tuning to crescendo exhale. No dialogue; diction biased to auditory/visual wonder.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence openings; metaphors cohere (liquid light, painted clouds) without muddle in performance peak. Minor synonym churn in "symphony/truth/wonder" repetitions, but pattern-taught as motif. Propulsion clear, no loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mute bell-tuner's ice-sculpture symphony transforms silence tropes into kinetic truth-making. Risky lyric build pays off in bluff's inhale/exhale; inevitable hindsight from pulse-match inciting beat. No derivative echoes.</comment>
