<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shines in embodied details like callused hands tracing the clipboard, revealing contradictory hope amid weariness; motivation to anchor ideals drives micro-choices like intervening in tempers. Final hopeful endurance earned via negotiation arc. Minor label-speak in "operatively gentle" slightly abstracts peak reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dawn arrival through lull to signing, with Charged Poise closure in "treaty was not perfect... a beginning," cost felt in "heart heavy yet hopeful." Orientation anchored early in terrace scene. Single continuous scene fits defaults perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Volcanic terrace, statues, and celestial arc vividly constrain timing and mirror cycles, charging final descent image. Clipboard as micro-setting recurs tactilely, shaping Elara's anchor. Sensory hierarchy reflects her priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of treaty success signaled early, tightens accumulatively via posturing-to-resignation shift at midday lull, narrowing to imperfect signing with visible cost in shaking hands and ambiguous clauses. Agency in Elara's guidance coheres pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of redemption's price emerges organically through clipboard scars and statues' vigil, reweighted non-literally in final "peace... worth the fight" image. Complexity embraced in flawed compromise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature in ritualistic noticing; voice modulates rhythmically from languid dawn to resolute close. Minimal dialogue natural and subtextual, e.g., "It's seen more peace than most men."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops on "price of redemption" across musings dull mid-lull beat; rhythmic variety strong otherwise. No filter stacks or template cadence in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of negotiator trope via scarred clipboard as character crucible; statues/celestials transform peace-war cycle organically. Risks poetic accumulative drive without gimmickry.</comment>
