<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to create music drives persistent micro-choices with embodied cost ("nails bled and her shoulders ached"), revealing symphonically minded traits through analysis of cracks; lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as strumming density builds to pattern break (insulator shatters, unleashing symphony); on-page RR closure with felt cost in tool destruction and prior physical toll reconfigures silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Grove and stump constrain choices (alders form amphitheater, moss cradles); porcelain insulator as micro-setting charges final image, with sensory details (vibrations in leaves, spines) filtered through Elara's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock music) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through days of effort narrowing options (bleeding nails force endurance); cost legible in shattered tool foreclosing old method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of enduring music emerges organically from vibrations translating "sculpture’s pain"; final grove echo offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (sounds felt "in her marrow," "bones"); rhythmic modulation heightens quiet intensity, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful "strum" repetition taught early; minor phrasing loops ("vibration"/"hum") in build-up slightly dull propulsion but spare peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tree-sculpting in silent world via insulator resonator feels inevitable; risk-taking in textural accumulation transforms tropes without gimmickry.</comment>
