<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in data-driven traits compels shift from isolation, earned via recorder's alarms and clinic encounter; interiority concrete but slips into summary epiphanies like "His motivation crystallized." Woman applies targeted pressure without stealing focus. Final log entry reveals hierarchy of values with solitude's cost felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: pigeon message → map check → rooftop survey → zone entry → vial acquisition → return, with tightening at perimeter alarm narrowing options. Orientation anchors in first paragraph. Closure as Charged Poise in burning note and new log, reconfiguring isolation with legible risk cost on final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Recorder as micro-setting constrains choices (altitude sensor, alarms) and charges final image; fog and courtyard evolve causally from hush to endorsing silence. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (weather symbols, particulates). Zone's "oppressive stillness" mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. isolation) signaled early via whispers/followed home, tightens causally at clinic reveal forcing vial choice with exposure cost. Agency in lateral progress and following woman forecloses safe retreat. Moral calculus between solitude and accountability sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of quiet truths in chaos emerges organically from recorder witnessing ash storm to engineered flu; final courtyard image reconfigures "integrity in solitude" via burned note without stating moral. Subtext in pigeon's unrecognized symbol implies silenced powers. Ambiguity lingers in stars' wink.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias toward data (recorder beeps, pressure readings); voice modulates rhythm from deliberate sparrows to shrill alarm. Brief dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("Trust no one," "silenced"). No head-hopping; diction matches meticulous mindset.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., fog blurring edges advances atmosphere and disorientation); rhythm varies for propulsion, peaking in clinic rasp. Minor paraphrase loops in courtyard returns (−0.3); no artifacts in closure. Clean syntax, strong verbs like "alighted," "curl."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Storm recorder transforms weather trope into biohazard detector; rogue zone's engineered flu offers fresh premise angle on denialism. Lateral rooftop evasion risks ingenuity without gimmick. Final "keeper of secrets" inflects isolation organically.</comment>
