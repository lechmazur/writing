<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to execute a flawless goodbye roots deeply in her mother's shard and embodied actions like humming, compelling the reunion; internal conflict via personal reminder of mother adds contradiction without summary. Clara and Elias pressure via reactions force Mira's micro-choices. Minor therapy-speak ("hold space") slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from vinyl prelude to hymn crescendo and Elias's sigh as RR/Charged Poise closure with emotional cost legible in loosening grip and flatline. Single scene oriented early (sunrise, haven, hours left). One tightening via Elias singing narrows to goodbye.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (lavender/hope scent intensifies, vinyl crackle, clouds drifting) filters through Mira's priorities, constraining via turntable use and sky-gazing tying to Elias's love. Windows charge final image of sun bleeding orange. No white-room; purposeful selection mirrors internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye) signaled early, tightens texturally via Elias's raspy join and shallow breath, forcing Mira's endurance/renunciation with cost in his death and Clara's raw grief. Agency in leaning closer, shoulder touch forecloses fear path. Escalation coheres without reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of mundane-made-sacred (hymning ordinary to bridge chasm) emerges organically via shard, scent, sky; final shard pact reconfigures endings as pulsing legacies without moralizing. Subtext in silences and gasps invites ambiguity on peace's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with Mira's perceptual signature (scent as hope's perfume, imperfections' rhythm); lyrical diction modulates to compression at death ("dissolving into a sigh"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Go on," "I'm here"), distinct voices. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety supports pulsing tone, high density in hymn swell; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("alchemy of melody," "fragrant reminder") during peak slightly muddles but doesn't touch closure. No loops; purposeful recurrence (scent, hum) propels. Clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hospice therapist + broken vinyl shard transforms deathbed trope into personal legacy cycle; risk in "above clouds" surrealism heightens stakes without gimmick. Shard exchange feels inevitable from early pocket cue.</comment>
