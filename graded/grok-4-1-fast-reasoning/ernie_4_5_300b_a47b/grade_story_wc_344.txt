<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied nostalgia tied to father's workshop, revealed through gloved touch on mirror; doubt in multiplying reflections shows contradiction under pressure. Final readiness earned via gear-handling micro-choice foreclosing doubt path. Minor tidy epiphany at close slightly undercuts raw ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: prophecy scraps → mirror scan → vial pour → chest open traces causal path to CR closure. Cost legible in "weight of that legacy" during lock-fitting, reconfiguring self-mending. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen mirrors constrain choice (wrong reflection spots chest) and charge final renewal image via brightening hall. Sensory selectivity (frost song under touch, cold seeping gloves) reflects locksmith priorities. No white-room; spatial choreography clear from stacks to alcove.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find gears) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via prophecy culmination in mirror tactic, narrowing to vial risk. Agency in scanning/uncapping forecloses failure with legacy cost felt in hands. One deepening sufficient; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of mending time/memory emerges organically from gear runes and ticking clock image reweighting premise. Nostalgia motif shifts from ache to harmony without stating moral. Final para edges toward articulation ("rhythm of repair..."), muting pure emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (locksmith attunement to "rhythm," "clicking" gears/mirrors). Rhythmic prose modulates from hush to surge; purposeful poetic compression taught early. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., vial pour integrates action/legacy); varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor overwriting in "driftwood nostalgia" and stacked figures ("frost-kissed portraits," "ice-bound shelves") in opening beat slightly muddles without obscuring closure. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith legacy in celestial library transforms trope via vial reveal and rune-etched gears. Risky mirror conceit (wrong coat reflection) heightens ingenuity without gimmick. Closure image (ticking clock) feels inevitable from repair motif.</comment>
