<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied grief and contradictory impulses in polishing the gem until it "weeps," revealing character through micro-choices like pressing it into the lantern despite trembling; final confrontation earned by prior causality. Minor slip in semi-diagnostic phrasing like "polishing her wounds into gems" borders therapy-speak but remains embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure: shadow recoils from lantern light, cost legible in "luminous torment" and trembling fingers. Orientation anchored early via workshop on floating island; one tightening via gem reflecting brother's face narrows options to confrontation. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Basilica's paradox constrains her magic, shuddering and shedding light to charge climax; floating tea garden's cranes stir responsively, mirroring internal transformation via POV-filtered sensory details like "lavender smoke and regret." Recurrent island undersides glittering pressure choices indirectly through awe/awe knot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform grief via lantern) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as brother's voice spills and shadow returns, forcing agency in holding up lantern; cost unmistakable in pain "wash[ing] over her." One deepening suffices, charging final image without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of folding grief into flight emerges organically via lanterns/cranes/basilica, reweighted in final polishing/next shadow readiness without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in cranes taking flight and shadow dissolving, tying to "grief with wings."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature—facets as "thousand captured stars"—modulates rhythm under stress to short, brittle laughs; stable single POV, no head-hopping. Patterned elision of past taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like gem shuddering to reflect face; varied rhythm passes read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Dense figuratives purposeful in lyric mode from start, no muddle at peak "light piercing the dark"; minor register elevation fits fantasy idiom.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-recording lanterns folding grief on floating isles transforms loss tropes via basilica paradox and shadow recoils; risk in luminous paradox heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight via cranes unraveling to lanterns.</comment>
