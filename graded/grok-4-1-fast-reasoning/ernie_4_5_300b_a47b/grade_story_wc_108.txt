<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lila's phobias embodied concretely (hands shake, breath hitches) fuel adaptive micro-choices like sidestepping the lunge, earning her final readiness; contradictory impulses act in the confrontation scene. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("vulnerability wasn’t a cage. It was a compass") borders therapy abstraction but ties to action without flattening pressure. Enforcer and mother apply targeted pressure without headcount blur.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: shell murmur → library → decryption → enforcer confrontation → escape → arrest → café reconfiguration. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in "Not yet. First, you have to earn it," reconfiguring mother-daughter options with relational cost felt in Marisol's trembling hands and smile. Orientation anchored by ~100 words; single transition to café shard legible, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rusted library specifics (groaning shelves by genre, child's pink cast with notes) constrain choices—script hurled as weapon—and charge decryption beat. Sensory hierarchy POV-filtered (boot echoes amid phobias); final café image subtly mirrors via shell on table. Body/attention (trembling knees) and recurring cast/shell evolve causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove vulnerability powers outwitting betrayal/enemies) signaled early, tightens causally via decryption revealing Marisol's survival, forcing confrontation agency (recites notes, agile dodge). Escalation narrows options with enforcer lunge; costs visible (trembling legs) alter tactics to escape. Café crystallizes stance with shell pull-back trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-as-power emerges organically from phobia-fueled sidestep and note recitation, resonating in final shell-between-them image without literal moral. "I proved vulnerability is power" in confrontation borders thematic echo but interleaves with action; café refusal offers non-literal answer reweighting betrayal premise. Complexity lingers in Marisol's fear vs. Lila's readiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (phobia-warped noticing: "phobias screamed"); voice rhythmic, lyrical yet propulsive. Dialogue goal-driven/subtextual (enforcer's "Give me the heirloom" vs. Lila's recitation cracking composure; Marisol's approach carries implication). No head-hopping; diction fits stunt-world lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "The shell’s whisper sharpened: Decrypt them" advances plot/foreshadows). Rhythm varies (short punchy climax sentences amid lyrical opens); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak beats like lunge. Minor figurative density ("yellowed like old wounds") purposeful without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: phobia stunt double decrypting child's cast notes transforms mob-heirloom betrayal trope via genetic phobias-as-map. Outwit via recited smudges and shell-whisper guidance feels inevitable from adaptive traits. Risky shard transition heightens relational closure without gimmick.</comment>
