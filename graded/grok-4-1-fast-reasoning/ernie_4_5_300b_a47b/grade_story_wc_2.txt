<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory certainty-obsession acts in obsessive digging and fall survival, earning garden renunciation; embodied stress in "ribs jolt" and trembling hands reveals flaw without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as shards density-build to CR closure in compass-mirror realization with imperfection cost; orientation anchored in cave opening; legible transitions via journal/map cues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Waterfall mist/roar constrains plunge/retrieval; greenhouse debris triggers fall, charging swirling-leaves reprise in garden image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to find truth tightens via map-to-fall reversal with rib cost; needle spin deepens knowledge under accumulative lens, forcing acceptance trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Garden/clockwork flowers offer resonant answer to uncertainty theme, reweighting ashes/clocks via earned particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tinkerer perceptual signature (gears, order/chaos) biases noticing consistently; rhythmic compression heightens fall stress without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; fall beat density layers sensory propulsion (roar/mist/grasp); rhythm varies with scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Compass-as-uncertainty-mirror transforms relic quest via tinkerer arc; clockwork garden risks bold synthesis heightening closure.</comment>
