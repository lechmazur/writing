<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in drone-pilot expertise drives micro-choices like grappling and lever pull; hesitation before lever reveals internal conflict with embodied surprise. Lira's perpetually surprised trait shown via hitched breath and mirrored recognition, constraining trust in pilgrim. Minor weakness: pilgrim feels archetypal mystic without deeper pressure on Lira's arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tracking pilgrim therefore alignment discovery therefore lever pull rotates dome, yielding CR closure in "hum in her bones, a pull toward the unknown" with conceptual cost of endless questions. Single scene anchors who/where/when by para 1; no orientation debt. One tightening via prism revelation narrows to star-dependent tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: drone buzz, stone hum, starlight beams constrain lever choice and charge final chip image. Dusk evolution to deepening stars mirrors resonance theme without overt symbolism; spatial choreography clear via drone projections and dome niches. Micro-setting (prism fractals, rusted lever) alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reassemble chip for frequency) signaled early, tightens via pilgrim's "alignment" reveal forcing star-dependent lever pull with hesitation risk. Agency in pull forecloses mechanical search; cost legible in success yielding "more questions." Escalation causal under lens, but pilgrim guidance softens pure protagonist pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of belonging as resonance emerges organically from chip assembly to heartbeat waveform, reweighted in final "melody without words." Subtext in pilgrim's whispers and Lira's bone-hum realization avoids moralizing. Pilgrim's direct "It’s not a place. It’s a resonance" borders echo but ties to on-page event.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Lira's perceptual bias (goggles overlays, drone feed); distinct texture in rhythmic phrases like "crown of shadows." Dialogue natural/subtextual, advances via "You’re here for the chip"; voices distinct (Lira direct, pilgrim harmonic). No head-hopping, compression purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels from drone scan to dome thrum; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative precision ("fractal shadows," "celestial keyhole") coherent, integrated into action without muddle in climax lever pull. Minor overwriting in opening descriptors doesn't touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone tech and ancient star-alignment yields non-obvious "frequency of belonging" premise, transformed via matrix chip's literal assembly into resonant hum. Risk in mystic pilgrim payoff heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; final "now we listen" feels inevitable.</comment>
