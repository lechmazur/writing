<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in orchard's fading hues compels ritual choices with embodied emotion in sap-weeping cut and bone-vibrating hum; micro-choices like climbing mossy stones reveal hierarchy of values. Internal impulses align without strong contradiction, yielding competent but untested depth at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain from fracture sense to seed-hurl and geyser eruption delivers DC closure with felt cost in absent seed and iridescent blossom; orientation anchors Elara/orchard/waterfall by para 1. Single scene holds lens without shards; blossom reprise tightens poignantly without micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Verdant parapet, mossy stones, and churning pool constrain climb and hurl, charging final shower image; sensory hierarchy (roar-to-hum, sap sweetness, color swirl) filters through pruner's bias. Details evolve causally with ritual, mirroring renewal without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder) signaled early, tightens via dream-cued method to essence-distill reversal narrowing options; hurl forecloses seed with pool-eruption cost under causal lens. Agency in incantation and throw drives resolution; no coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of endless wonder emerges from paling blossoms to rainbow shower and torch-passing image reweighting finite magic premise without statement. Resonance from particulars like etched seed and iridescent petal avoids platitudes; ambiguity in journey's continuation invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited voice stable with pruner-specific perceptual bias (roots/soil whispers, branch-shadowing); rhythm modulates from hush to eruption without head-hopping. Compression in incantation murmur teaches poetic pattern paid at blossom reprise; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Figurative density (liquid gold sunlight, pink tongues, rustle voice) overwrites high-pressure ritual beat without restraint, muddling propulsion amid meteorite knife and color absorption; minor paraphrase in renewal descriptions. Rhythm varies but elevated diction risks register drift from calloused hands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Heirloom seed bridging worlds transforms fading orchard trope via essence-ritual synthesis, inevitable in hindsight; pruner-as-weaver angle freshens magic-preservation premise without hedging. Risky lyric metaphors heighten radiant hush stakes coherently.</comment>
