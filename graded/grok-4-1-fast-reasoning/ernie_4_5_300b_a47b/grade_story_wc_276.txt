<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cool-headedness shines in composure amid "surge of emotion—grief, longing," enabling micro-choices like striking spike twice; fisher trait limited to "calloused fingers," undramatized in core turns.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds from fraying to goddess dissolution; Charged Poise closure in "goddess...dissolved...essence seeping," with cost legible as "goddess was gone" reconfiguring garden stability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden's resonant flora (crystal trees, moss ripples) constrains strikes and paths, charging closure in shimmering soil; sensory hierarchy (vibrations in bones) reflects Kael's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch goddess echo) tightens texturally via pattern intensification to dissolution; agency in strikes forecloses her persistence, cost felt in stable but altered constellations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of emotional patterns emerges via spike's transliteration to tear-shaped constellation; final note reweights listening as feral hope's resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (vibrations "in his bones"); rhythmic diction modulates from dissonant to "pure, clear tone," heightening pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates action/imagery without loops; minor figurative density ("lullaby sung by wolves") coherent to tone, propels via varied rhythm to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic garden and emotional constellations risks bold world-logic, inevitable in hindsight via spike's evolving transliteration; no derivative echoes.</comment>
