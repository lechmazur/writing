<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to free trapped creativity intensifies through embodied micro-choices like aligning the sextant and spilling stardust, earning the final laughter and unburdened mind. Interiority concrete via stardust memories seeping into skin, avoiding stock epiphanies. Contradictory impulses (chasing vs. dissolving ideas) act in the chamber climax, with visible cost of prior half-formed symphonies foreclosed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from aurora pulse to stardust flood, culminating in CR/RR closure where mind buzzes with falling stars, reweighting trapped creativity with undeniable prior cost. Orientation anchored early (Kael at archway under aurora). Single scene coheres, no shards; sextant-to-chamber causality tightens options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Aurora-lit archway and chamber constrain choices (aligning stone reveals hidden space) and charge final image (archway fades, sextant cold). Sensory hierarchy (ozone air, prickling dust) reflects dreamer's priorities, integrated into action without stalls. Micro-setting via sextant lenses magnifies glimmers, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free creativity) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via voice murmur, chamber reveal, stardust spill narrowing to flooded mind. Agency in tracing finger arc forces deepening; cost legible in dissolved symphonies now realized. Coherent pressure under lens culminates in earned reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of creativity as waiting stardust emerges implicitly from jars ("Dreamer’s Unspoken Truth") and final sky-drowning, offering non-literal resonant answer via constellations spelling fears/desires. Subtext in "listened" realization reweights premise without moralizing. Complexity lingers in shadowed rapture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (eyes as fractured galaxies, aurora seeping skin); diction/rhythm poetic yet biased to dreamer's cosmic lens. Voice modulates from vow to raw laughter under pressure, consistent texture. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts—each line advances image/pressure (e.g., "stardust spill... prickled like frost"). Purposeful lyric overwriting fits voice, coherent metaphors (aurora breath). Propulsion peaks clean in chamber dissolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stardust jars and holographic sextant transforms dreamer trope into indispensable closure charge. Risky shadowed rapture heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, inevitable in hindsight via archway shudder.</comment>
