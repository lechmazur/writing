<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in petrichor obsession intensifies via psychometry flashes, compelling delve; embodied reactions like "hands trembling" reveal under indifferent presence; earned change to "hungry for more" forecloses certainty with felt cost, though internal contradictions act more accumulatively than simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density and psychometry build to CR closure: lagoon realization reweights quest ("tasted the edge of the unknowable"), with legible cost in ripples/presence and trembling hands; one tightening via compass drop suffices; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy (petrichor "thicker," "resonant hush") filters through collector's bias, constraining wading/kneeling; limestone cliffs/lagoon evolve causally (slick walls to still water); final jars/compass charge image as micro-settings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pure petrichor site) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via visions/ripples narrowing to presence confrontation; agency in psychometry/collecting despite indifference; cost unmistakable in drop/tremble forcing exit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity outliving certainty emerges organically from expedition echoes and threshold; final "low, endless hum" offers resonant CR repricing premise without moralizing, reweighting prior collections.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with scent-biased perceptual signature ("air grew cooler, sweeter"); rhythmic modulation builds tension (short sentences in cavern); purposeful poetic diction fits sensibly eccentric voice without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory (e.g., "waded into the water, her boots sinking"); varied rhythm accelerates in climax (compass "vibrated so violently"); no loops, clean syntax, zero artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Petrichor psychometry + indifferent threshold synthesize fresh sensory quest transcending lost-expedition trope; risk in esoteric method pays off at "hum" CR; inevitable in hindsight via jar motif.</comment>
