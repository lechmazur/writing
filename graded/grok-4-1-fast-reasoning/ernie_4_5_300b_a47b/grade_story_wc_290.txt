<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied concretely as clawing ribs and tightening chest drives contradictory impulses—prudence vs. lunge—with micro-choices like steeling himself and jabbing the compass revealing values under pressure. Final endurance of returning phobia with clutched key earns stasis with felt cost. Minor slip: epiphanic "he’d earned this" borders unearned without deeper prior irony.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: organ note triggers vision therefore lunge flips world, twist therefore jab stills corridor for key drop. Orientation anchors early (Elias in cathedral nexus under starlight). Charged Poise closure ("shadowed nexus...a gateway") reconfigures with claustrophobia cost legible in final shudder and step. One tightening sufficient; no shards/transitions violate defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus under starlight and organ reverberation constrain choices (starlight guides path, walls bend forcing jab). Sensory hierarchy narrows to tactile stone, hissing metal, pulsing key under crisis. Final dissolution charges image without overt symbolism. Recurrent starlight reweights from fractured to guiding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (key) tightens causally via organ pull narrowing options to lunge/jab, with agency in micro-choices foreclosing retreat. Escalation forces trade-off (claustrophobia surge for thrill). Cost visible in returning phobia and risked "something worse," charging final poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Wistful rebellion emerges organically from prudent adventure vs. spatial resistance, culminating in gateway reconfiguration without moralizing. Key's constellation teeth and pulsing warmth subtly mirror internal arc. Ambiguity lingers in "something worse?" inviting reflection. Minor drift: rebellion feels slightly imposed in final line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (claustrophobia-tinged notices: pressing silence, unraveling fabric). Rhythmic prose modulates tension (short bursts in chase, sustained in dirge). No dialogue; diction character-bound, avoiding filter stacks. Consistent poetic texture suits fantasy without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density in action lines (e.g., "jabbed...sank with a hiss, corridor stilled"); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting in peak (mixed "rubber" walls/shimmering visions verge muddle, -0.4). No loops/artifacts dull closure; varied syntax, strong verbs propel causally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Claustrophobia + spatial mutiny transforms relic hunt trope via compass jab and organ pull, synthesizing fresh premise. Key as constellation/heartbeat pulses originality to closure. Bold dimensional nexus risks pay off in legible poise. No close echoes; lived details anchor fantasy.</comment>
