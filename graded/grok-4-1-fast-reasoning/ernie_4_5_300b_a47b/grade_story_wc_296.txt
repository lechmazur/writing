<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Guarded traits shown via thorn walls and frayed memories compel entry and acceptance; contradictory impulses peak in blood-stained vision tightening chest. Final endurance of darkness earned via prior micro-choices like seed release. Minor slip: therapy-adjacent "strength to carry it" borders diagnostic without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density and vision deepen stake to CR closure where seed reprise reweights self-perception with guilt cost ("poisoning her"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene tightens via seed eruption and spore vision. Cost legible in "heart lighter" after confrontation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vortex/trees constrain entry and spin, mirroring internal chaos; scents (decaying fruit, ozone) and ghostly shapes filter via druid bias, charging final slowing trees. Micro-setting (staff, boots in mud) grounds body in pressure. Recurrent orchard evolves causally to stillness, recharging closure image.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hidden truths) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via method, seed release, vision reversal deepening knowledge of violence. Agency in expanding circles and spore inhalation forecloses denial with felt guilt cost. One tightening (eruption) narrows to acceptance; minor abstractness in "warlike serenity" dilutes peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden darkness emerges via blood vision and seed transformation, resonating in final "some lost things worth keeping" without moralizing. Subtext in mirrors motif reweights via lake's refusal to forget. Final image answers "what mirrors don't show" non-literally, embracing ambiguity of self-defense guilt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with druid perceptual signature (bark hands, tree empathy); rhythm modulates from chaotic winds to steady breath under stress. Diction nature-tied and biased (trees "groan," "claw"). No head-hopping; purposeful compression in vision pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "cloak snapping" advances setting/action/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, varying openers. Minor template stems ("She had" x3 early) and occasional modifier stacks ("sickly green light, its hunger") trigger -0.3 artifact deduction without touching closure. No loops or muddle in peak spore beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes (vortex vision quest) transformed via seed's hunger-to-truth arc and druid's self-lost stake; fresh synthesis in expanding circles method yielding frozen confession. Risk in warlike serenity tone heightens resonance without gimmick. Irreplaceable: lake's personified rage drives CR.</comment>
