<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority peaks in feeling the ridge's pain during Hush; ethically diligent trait shown via rejecting haste but borders label-speak without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Resonant Reconfiguration (slow swing restarts, ridge seals); raw hands as legible cost on final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian ridge constrains climb/discovery and charges healing image; selective sensory hierarchy (slick shards, hum in bones) reflects POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent chaos via swing) tightens via deepening Hush forcing palm press; agency forecloses immobility with raw hands cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Incremental absolution emerges via inscription echo in slow arc, reweighting balance as dance without moralizing; resonant non-literal close ties to prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (warped reflection, runes glow) with rhythmic modulation under Hush stress; stable close third-person limited.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (rake aligned with runes); varied rhythm propels without loops, though minor figurative density in reverie beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh premise transforms clock-tides mediation via obsidian/inscription logic; risk of mythic ridge as character heightens stakes organically.</comment>
