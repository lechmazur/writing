<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Solid interiority via embodied details like "shell felt heavier" and micro-choices under restlessness; final peace earned through prior promise and cave vision without unearned epiphany. Contradictory impulses act in hesitation at fork and placing shell. Single-POV coherence strong, no diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup from quay to cavern pool tightens via wrong turn and vision, yielding Charged Poise closure in "weight of decades lifting" with cost of unrelenting tides legible in final lines. Orientation anchored early via painter and harbor. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (brine, warm water, shaft of light) filtered through painter's eye constrains choices like stooping in tunnels and charges closure via reflecting pool and shells. Micro-setting of pool and shell-as-object mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restlessness to solace signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fork choice, vision, and drawing that reweights options; agency in veering left and placing artifacts forecloses isolation path with emotional cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in fractures emerges organically from cracked mirror, shell, and pool vision to resonant final image of carrying cavern peace without moralizing. Subtext in "temporary eternity" shifts via concrete experience, inviting ambiguity on time's tide.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Painterly perceptual signature ("shifting moods of the harbor," vivid colors) stable in third-limited POV; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, no head-hopping or withholding. Voice distinct and biased toward light/shadows.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied syntax and no loops propel from quay to closure image. Minor "cracks" repetition contained, non-closure; specific diction like "salt and pigment" elevates without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nostalgic introspection via cave as "temporary eternity" oasis, transforming familiar artist-journey trope through shell motif and warm pool vision; risk in lyric closure pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
