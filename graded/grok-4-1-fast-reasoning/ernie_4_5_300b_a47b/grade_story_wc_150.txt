<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in diaspora restoration, with embodied curiosity in "spoke to the trees, to the bones," but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; smooth competence without blind spots or complicating flaws reduces depth at pivotal placement of sundial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from discoveries to harmonic tone; Charged Poise closure at "She chose to follow" reconfigures faith as choice with felt effort cost, orientation anchored early; one meaningful tightening via roots' reverent shift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration like "roots twisting like serpents through ribcages" mirrors internal rhythms and constrains via coiling ankles; recurring bones/roots charge final glow image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuild/restore) signaled early but pressure static, lacking coherent tightening that forecloses options; sundial activation feels accumulative but coincidence-free opposition absent, diluting agency at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of faith-as-choice emerges organically from particulars like grandmother's stars to final "not finished, but enough"; resonant non-literal end reweights restoration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in "warmly curious about every shadow"; rhythmic diction modulates from unhurried wandering to pulsing heartbeat, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, vivid verbs like "crunching over sun-bleached bones"; minor density of metaphors in chamber glow risks overwriting but doesn't obscure closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh catacomb orchard synthesis transforms diaspora trope via bone-root entanglement; purposeful wandering risks stasis but culminates in earned, non-obvious reconfiguration of faith.</comment>
