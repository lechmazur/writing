<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion in "throat tighten" and tears, with hesitation showing contradictory caution vs. need; micro-choice to uncork earns shift to embracing scents. Minor slip in tidy "inherited sorrow woven into her DNA" diagnostic phrasing at vision peak slightly undercuts rawness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via scent density building to CR closure in final vial clutch and city breath, with felt tear cost legible; orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene causality clear from rumor to UV inhale to vision payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective scents and "ultraviolet panels" constrain vial choice and charge final city-smell image; POV filters via aromatic bias. Greenhouse relics mirror internal grief without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unlock smell-grief tightens via risky inhale under Accumulative lens, with tears as felt cost narrowing caution path; one deepening via visions suffices. Agency in uncorking forecloses avoidance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-love emerges organically from vision particulars to final non-literal city inhale resonance; no moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from scent-memory question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with aromatic perceptual signature in "fragrant relics" and vapor twist; rhythmic modulation builds to closure breath. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety and density propel via integrated sensory propulsion; minor figurative stack in "crystal shadows dancing across the walls" during peak slightly muddles without obscuring closure. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh UV-scent memory premise transforms extinction trope via personal DNA-weave; risk in olfactory visions heightens stakes organically to closure reweighting.</comment>
