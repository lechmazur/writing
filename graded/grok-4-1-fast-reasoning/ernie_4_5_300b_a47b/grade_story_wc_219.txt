<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lirael's skeptical obsession drives the amber placement micro-choice under Kael's pressure, revealing contradictory impulses toward exposure versus truth, with embodied ache as cost; final laugh earns change via prior causality despite Kael's partial articulation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sculpture path density builds to amber mist inversion (DC/RR), reconfiguring skepticism with legible ache cost; single tightening via convergence pays off without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sculptures (glass arms, clockwork heart, kneeling woman) constrain ascent and charge final mirror realization, with sensory hum/vibration narrowing skeptic's perception purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Skepticism stake signaled early tightens via amber test, forcing endurance of longing ache that forecloses denial; agency in placement narrows options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Artificial vs. collision homecoming emerges implicitly via mist inversion and "mirrors" realization, reweighting premise in final laugh/door creak without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with skeptic's perceptual signature (dissecting myths, iridescent wings); dialogue subtext distinguishes voices, rhythm modulates mist peak cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density in sculpture details propels without loops; varied rhythm/syntax heighten inversion ("colors bled...wails"), no figurative muddle or artifacts at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthetists' engineered pilgrimages and glowing sculptures synthesize fresh mystic-science angle, with convergence risk heightening stakes organically.</comment>
