<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion in memories surfacing during transcription; contradictory paranoia vs. trust shown in hesitation before acting. Final change to rekindled courage earned by prior micro-choices like kneeling despite risk. Minor diagnostic tone in "fixing what’s broken required more than deciphering codes" edges from 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to realization with tightening at creak interruption and symbol completion. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph. Closure as Charged Poise in final descent image reconfigures options with felt internal cost; lens unambiguous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist and bluff edge constrain choices (isolation enables risk) and charge final parting mist image. Sensory details selective via POV urgency (wind threading hair, frost-kissed gravel). Environment mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim courage) signaled early, tightens via hesitation and false alarm to endurance in descent. Agency in transcribing forecloses paralysis path with legible emotional cost. Under Accumulative lens, density reweights stake without reversal requirement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of secrets as poison emerges organically from pillbox handling and memory interleaves. Final image of lighter steps offers resonant non-literal answer to courage question, reweighting prior layers. No moralizing; ambiguity in ongoing journey lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (lyrical bias toward natural metaphors like "temporary tattoo"). Rhythm modulates with intensity, compressing in creak spin. No elision or head-hopping; prose as character reflects spy's honed patience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "quill raised, but it was only the wind" advances action/emotion/clarity). Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (mist "like a second skin") coherent but dense in opener. No loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms burned-spy trope via poetic, internal quest over action; bluff as liminal metaphor fresh. Risky lyric voice heightens stakes without gimmick. Synthesis of codes/memories feels inevitable, non-obvious.</comment>
