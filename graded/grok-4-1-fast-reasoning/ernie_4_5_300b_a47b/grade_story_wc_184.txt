<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation to translate chaos into order drives consistent micro-choices like reweaving braids despite sparks; embodied stress in "tremor in her knees" reveals flaws. Final realization as "weaver of timelines" earned by prior actions but slightly told via "crystallized."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain solid: schematics realization leads to reconfiguration, door opening, chamber access, scroll copy triggering return as CR with felt cost in sudden reset ("door closed, gears humming"). Orientation anchored early; single scene holds lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via gears jamming/sparks during reconfiguration; sensory details (scent of "aged parchment and iron," torches) filter through archivist POV and charge final beam piercing ceiling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (access lost knowledge) tightens at gear jam/shower of sparks, forcing endurance; agency in pressing on narrows options with visible risk (distorted shadow).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of preserved absences emerges via scroll "On the Merging of Absences"; final return reweights premise non-literally, lingering ambiguity of inaccessible knowledge without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in symbol/archival noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks in reconfiguration beat, diction purposeful without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory (e.g., "braids snapped into place"); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds, even in peak spark/door-glow moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival seal/rope braids unlocking timeline chamber transforms hidden-door trope; risk in magical reset heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
