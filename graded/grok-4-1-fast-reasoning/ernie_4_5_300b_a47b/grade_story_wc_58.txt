<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to map healing via obits and projection is concrete and intensifies through the vision; interiority embodied in ink-stained fingers and aching chest. Micro-choices like writing during the vision reveal values under pressure. Lacks on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, keeping it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to garden shift and vision (tightening), fading to Charged Poise closure where parchment as "map of lives restored" reconfigures absences with emotional cost felt in "heart lighter" after ache. Orientation anchored early; lens taught and coherent to end. Cost legible in final lingering on thread.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shadowed garden, moss, silver thread, jasmine constrain choices (kneel, brush, follow) and charge final image (lingering fingers). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (rustle syncing breath); mirrors internal lonesome splendor without overt symbolism. 9+ gate met: recurring thread shapes closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (explain absence via projection) signaled early; Accumulative escalation via density to vision-sharing gaze, narrowing to realization that spares love's weight. Agency in writing bridge forecloses despair path with felt ache-cost. Minor abstractness in stakes keeps from 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of healing geographies emerges organically from thread-vision and obits; final image (parchment to chest, walking into light) offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting absences as beginnings. Mild thematic echo in "explained absences were not endings" line nudges down; no overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual signature ("lonesome splendor," "geography of healing"); syntax/rhythm modulate from contemplative to urgent vision-writing. Stable single POV, no leakage; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. 9+ test: rhythmic control under vision pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, strong verbs propel; metaphors coherent (thread as "language of absence"). Paraphrase loops in final paragraphs ("journey continued," repeated "after last ship sailed") and synonym churn ("thread by thread, obituary by obituary") dull late momentum (-0.8 non-closure cap), but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-thread obits and presence-projection transforms loss tropes into "geography of healing." Risky lyric Accumulative structure heightens resonance; final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars. 9+ test: non-obvious angle feels organic.</comment>
