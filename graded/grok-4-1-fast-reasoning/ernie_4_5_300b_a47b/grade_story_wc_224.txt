<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through avoidance to desperate seeding, with embodied pain and micro-choice of whispering "I want to remember." Internal conflict embodied in gasping wakes and tracing stone. Final acceptance of shards as truth earned by prior memory burden, with visible cost on hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: feather seeding builds density to stone flare, cavern test, shatter—CR closure reconfigures self/home with pain cost legible in "shards embedding in her skin." Orientation anchored early in bookstore/mountain. No debt; visionary shards transition legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mercury skin and crystalline cavern constrain choices (reflect glow, flare to freeze stones); feather/stone as micro-setting charge final obsidian-flecked hands. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under crisis (hum like thunder, rocks tumbling). Details evolve causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (home's shape via memories) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via vision deepening to cavern pressure forcing power use. Cavern shake narrows options; cost in pain/lost stone unmistakable, foreclosing prior avoidance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth/memory/home emerges organically from stone mirror, seeded intention, shard embedding. Final "shape of home...in the act of remembering" reweights prior fragments non-literally. Resonance in mountain glow without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (skin reflecting lanterns/fungi). Lyrical diction/rhythm modulate intensity (short sentences in shake: "The cavern shook. Rocks tumbled."). Minimal dialogue natural, advances ("You did it").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, propulsion aligns with beats; rhythm varies (long descriptive opens to punchy climax). Minor repetition ("labyrinthine bookstore") purposeful anchor, no loops obscuring shatter. Figuratives coherent (symbols pulse like liquid).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mercury seer/stone-feather synthesis transforms memory trope into skin-lock mechanic, inevitable at shatter. Bold visionary shards heighten stakes without gimmick; fresh "texture of a feather" seeds ingenuity.</comment>
