<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cedar's molting trait creates embodied contradiction, shown in trembling hands and final non-panic acceptance during the shift; Marla's secondary pressure via her daughter's story forces a relational micro-choice to share the tin. Final endurance of chaos feels earned with visible cost in dulled/sharpened eyes. Minor flaw: brief diagnostic phrasing like "mind fracturing and reforming" borders therapy-speak but anchors in present quake sensation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building via tin handling, poem writing, and molting; closure as Charged Poise in new poem discovery ("To forge beauty from anarchy, you must first become the anarchy") reconfigures rebuild premise with felt cost of self-loss. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in library/moon. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rusted library and tin as micro-settings constrain choices (hiding spot, talisman handling) and charge final image of replacement under stars. Sensory details like scuffing boots and flickering bulbs selective via poet's bias, mirroring internal fracture. Moon progression evolves coherently with pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuild via tin amid molting) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through sharing with Marla and on-page molt with new poem deepening acceptance; agency in quill-dipping and non-panic nod forecloses rebuild-only path. Cost legible in eye-shift quake and foregone panic. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of growth through chaos emerges organically from tin poems, molting, and "blooming resistance" evolving to embrace anarchy in final poem; resonant non-literal answer reweights prior fragments without moralizing. Subtext in Marla's silence/soil metaphor enriches without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature in poetic noticing (e.g., "boots scuffing... like desperate fireflies"); dialogue natural/subtextual (Marla's grumble softens to daughter reveal, pursuing quiet alliance). Rhythm modulates with stress, diction fits vagrant poet.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., tin reveal advances character/stakes); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor deduction for figurative density in opener ("moth’s wings... fireflies") without payoff and repeated "tin" phrasing bordering loop, but no closure touch or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of molting poet trope with tin relic and prison library friendship transforms vagrant archetype; risky poetic voice/lyric closure heightens stakes. Final poem turn inevitable from established fragments.</comment>
