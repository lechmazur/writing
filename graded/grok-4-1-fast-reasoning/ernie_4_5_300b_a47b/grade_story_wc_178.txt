<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's frugality as armor compels intuitive decoding of the tile, with embodied skepticism ("scoffed at metaphysics") contradicting curiosity in the merging beat, earning the self-covenant shift. Minor reflective summaries slightly abstract interiority before peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density in tile grids and holographic constellations builds to CR closure where the slab dissolves into a self-refracting mirror ("her own face, superimposed on a starfield"), with legible cost in clutched edges biting her palm and foreclosed void-fear. Single scene causality links discoveries seamlessly; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy filters through astronomer's bias (star-chart eyes, celestial patterns), with palace panel groove constraining tile insertion and bioluminescent chamber charging the merge. Micro-setting via tile as recurring object evolves to shape final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to seal covenant tightens accumulatively via voice confrontation and tile merge, narrowing external quest to internal lens with agency in arrangement; cost felt in chamber shudders and personal irony reconfiguration. One deepening suffices, charging poise without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity-sealed self-covenant emerges organically from frugal decoding and ironic lens ("Irony's a poor substitute for answers"), with final "Asharu" word reweighting empirical skepticism non-literally. Ambiguity lingers in tile's questions without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in mathematical intuition (grids "shifting under her gaze"); dialogue subtextual ("You’ve bridged the empirical and the ironic") advances revelation. Rhythmic modulation peaks crisply in merge without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (short punchy reactions amid descriptive swells); minor figurative density ("wind through reeds") in voice beat purposeful for tone, no loops dulling closure image of static grid word.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Babylonian math mysticism as personal lens transforms artifact trope, with tile's self-reflection inevitable from schematic buildup; risks dusky lyricism heightening ironic theme without gimmick.</comment>
