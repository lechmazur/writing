<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied conflict in trembling fingers and racing mind before sliding the letter, earning the pact; minor diagnostic label-speak ("bravely conflicted heart") dilutes peak interiority without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through letter-to-awakening-to-pact chain; closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly in hand-brush and "no going back," with legible cost of Council pursuit; orientation anchored immediately in library and role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains archivist role and charges closure via echoing whispers of approval; "ice crystals bloomed... cracking like a whispered secret" integrates sensory urgency with internal thaw perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. censorship) tightens causally via decision to awaken, narrowing options with agency; cost felt in heartbeat frenzy and foreseen Council hunt, though no micro-reversal beyond inciting act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of thawing truth emerges organically through cryo-thaw image shifting to revolutionary fire; final pact reweights preservation vs. action without stating moral, though "truth matters" edges overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias on ice/fog mirroring turmoil; poetic rhythm ("ghostly plume that dissipated") modulates tension, dialogue natural and goal-pursuing in Kael's "Why?" exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops on "echoing library under snow" (4x) and "dizzying quiet" (3x) create template cadence, dulling density in opening and final beats; figurative density overwrites high-pressure awakening without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cryo-archive as truth vault transforms stasis trope into fresh rebel-thaw premise; hand-brush pact inflects organically from prior particulars without hedging.</comment>
