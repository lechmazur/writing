<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ghost bride's motivation layers grief and gratitude convincingly, with contradictory love/venom impulses shown in her smile and vow; Elara's shift from curiosity to understanding feels earned via bead placement. Minor weakness: Elara's interiority remains thinner than ghost's, limiting relational crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to resonant reconfiguration closure: greenhouse fractures into dawn as debt resolves, cost legible in "He is free, and so am I." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via Elara's bead-on-fruit action suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting as prison/sanctuary constrains choices, with crystalline fruits and runes charging closure image; sensory details (frost on panes, humming fruits) filter through ghost's spectral bias. Micro-object (pomegranate) mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt repayment for mutual freedom) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via cameo fruits to resonant awakening tightening options; cost felt in eternal bond's bittersweet end. Elara's agency forecloses ghost's limbo with on-page shudder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of coexisting love/venom emerges organically from backstory betrayal to release; final image of blooming fields and lingering laughter reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of transcendence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person voice stable with perceptual signature in spectral imagery; ghost's whispers natural and subtextual, advancing release. Rhythmic modulation heightens pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (gown from funerals, shadows like ink); no loops, rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwrites in metaphors cohere under taught spectral pattern, not dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost debt and alchemical release via meteorite bead/pomegranate messages transforms tropes; risk in venomous love calculus heightens stakes organically.</comment>
