<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation to reawaken dormant stories intensifies through embodied actions like tracing hyperbolic diagrams, earning her transformation; internal restlessness shows contradiction but lacks simultaneous impulses in peak vision, slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (scarf texture, rustling pages) builds to Conceptual Repricing in the poem's realization—"I am the silence between notes"—reconfiguring stories as mental curves with felt emotional cost in tears; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Scientific poetry library vividly selective—Edison bulbs, leather spines, hyperbolic diagrams—constrains her ritual via proximity to *The Poetry of Dimensions*; recurring scarf charges final image as tactile anchor mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken stories) signaled in restlessness, tightens accumulatively through scarf visualization narrowing to visionary access; agency in midnight ritual forces endurance with legible cost in heartbeat quickening and tears, charging poise to "Continue."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stories as living vibrations emerges organically from particulars like frayed scarf and spiraling diagrams, resonant non-literal answer in poem reweighting analog memories without moralizing; final library vitality ties arc inextricably.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward unseen traces (lavender-ink scent), rhythmic modulation heightens vision ("air seemed to shimmer"); dialogue natural/subtextual in "Mobius strip" exchange advances eccentricity without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion—rustling pages advance texture/causality; minor overwriting in reflective blocks ("fragile, tangible echoes") borders scaffold but anchors present without obscuring closure image of whispering scarf.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry as key to story-realm synthesizes poetry/science ingeniously, transforming tropes via grounded ritual; risk in visionary shard pays off in inevitable CR, fresh beyond template mysticism.</comment>
