<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation to preserve via creativity is rooted in traits like refusal to accept breakage, shown in embodied tension ("chest tightened") and micro-choices (dismantling, singing lullaby). Internal conflict emerges in fear versus innovation, earning her realization as collaborator. Minor diagnostic slip in "foxglove regret" slightly abstracts emotion without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cracked tube to orchid response to stirring feelings, with closure as Charged Poise RR—chime's new song reconfigures preservation, cost legible in "fracture and reform" and rising nameless emotion. Orientation anchored early (Lirael tending orchids in opal library). One tightening via song's harmony suffices; lens taught implicitly from start.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (prismatic whispers, bamboo hum) filter through Lirael's priorities, constraining choices (resonance for orchids) and charging final image (rainbows, library hums back). Micro-setting like cracked tube evolves causally. No white-room; spatial choreography clear across halls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chime repair or feelings release) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via director's denial then Lirael's song tightening options (old repair impossible, new harmony with cost: "not as it had been"). Agency in singing forecloses stasis; felt price in stirred ghosts alters equilibrium.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of preservation as evolution emerges organically from particulars (cracked tube to new song), final image of nameless emotion rising offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting "museum of extinct feelings." Subtext in hologram's wavering tone and Lirael's heavy/light heart embraces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (systematic hands on orchids, memory-glow thoughts); voice modulates rhythmically, lyric diction purposeful and taught early. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual (director's "You cannot resurrect" pressures). No head-hopping; compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy realizations amid lyrical flows), no loops/artifacts; figurative language (e.g., "iridescent mist") pattern-taught, supports textural buildup without muddle. Propulsion peaks in song beat; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinct emotions as archived mist, repaired via forgotten song transforms preservation trope; risk in surreal setting (library above clouds) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via Lirael's creativity amid director's stasis.</comment>
