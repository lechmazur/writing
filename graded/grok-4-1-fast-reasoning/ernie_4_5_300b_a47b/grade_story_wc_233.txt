<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Queen's contradictory impulses shine in bristling at the figure's lecture and stumbling heel-catch retreat, earning her final understanding; embodied emotions like sweat-damp sheets and iron taste ground her disenchantment without clichés.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via dream density to grotto revelation (CR closure: "understood" reconfigures her "disenchanted" premise with felt cost of accepted fear); orientation anchors firmly by para 2, single-shard climb pays off seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight pooling in palms and warm/viscous gravel constrain her kneeling choice and charge final glistening hands image; sensory hierarchy (ozone/lacy menace narrowing to bone-rumble) mirrors rising urgency through queen's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end dreams/unravel why she feels nothing) tightens accumulatively via figure's mirror challenge forcing stance crystallization; cost legible in silent weight-pressing realization before turning away, though no agency-driven reversal beyond endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of bleeding as internal fear emerges organically from starlight mirror and wound-grotto parallel, resonating in non-literal final hands image reweighting disenchantment without moralizing; subtext in figure's chimes-laugh tensions her denial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (mist-slick stones, bone-echo voice) biases toward queen's sensory intimacy; dialogue subtext-driven (her steady reply vs. figure's challenge) distinguishes voices, rhythmic modulation peaks at shuddering grotto.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "boots crunching on gravel that sparked like crushed glass" advances setting/action); minor metaphor pile-up ("bruise," "wound," "bleeding") in opening slightly muddles but pattern-taught; no loops, varied rhythm reads aloud smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-quest trope via bleeding starlight as self-mirror wound transforms introspection into visceral fantasy; risk in androgynous light-figure and exhale-fireflies guidance heightens inevitability without gimmick.</comment>
