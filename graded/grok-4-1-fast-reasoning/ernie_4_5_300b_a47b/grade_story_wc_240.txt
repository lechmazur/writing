<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael's spatially gifted mind parsing fractal flaws and hesitation before stepping through reveal contradictory impulses under pressure; final nod to stay earns change via echoed obsession. Lira applies relational crucible effectively. Minor diagnostic self-awareness in "physics of surrender" line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal linkages hold: laser reveals conceptual filter, Lira's words sync with Kael's obsession to prompt passage, frequency adjustment triggers DC closure with farm's dissolution. Single scene oriented early; lens clear by midpoint. Cost legible in softened column and pocketed pointer.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent canopy and permeable barrier constrain intent-based passage and charge laser's final sync; fractal shadows and pulsing column mirror internal states through action. Sensory selectivity sharpens under dimming lights. Recurrent farm evolution ties to closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to revolutionize barriers tightens via emotional filter realization, forcing surrender agency; laser adjustment forecloses rigid analysis path with felt ecosystem cost. Pressure coheres causally to Charged Poise in nod to stay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of surrender as flow emerges via barrier's "breathing" fear and column softening, reweighting control in final spore rain without statement. Subtext in Lira's "letting go" layers ambiguity resolved non-literally by harmonious patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias in spatial parsing; voice lyrical yet controlled, modulating rhythm in climax shudder. Dialogue subtextual ("real challenge is letting go") pursues goals distinctly from narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/action without loops; rhythm varies in climax ("shuddered, then softened"). Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("smooth as mycelium") but purposeful for tone; no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum-emotional barriers and bioluminescent psychology transforms security trope; laser's evolving frequency feels inevitable from spatial gift. Risk in sentient ecosystem pays off in permeable strength reconfig.</comment>
