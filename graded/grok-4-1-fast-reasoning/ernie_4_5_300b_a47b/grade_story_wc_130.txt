<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in brother's loss compels ritual choices, with embodied emotions (trembling fingers, tears mixing with sap) and contradictory impulses (loss as void vs. fractal) acting in scene. Final embrace of chaos earned by prior micro-choices like aligning chips. Interiority particular and degraded under stress without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ritual setup to light resonance, memory surge, and mosaic shift as Conceptual Repricing closure reconfiguring loss with emotional cost in "tears mixing with the sap." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent. Cost legible in final trembling touch and presence felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selection (dripping stalactites' plink as lullaby, sap's ethereal blue glow) filtered through Elara's fractal-seeking POV constrains ritual choice on mosaic stone. Orchard pulses mirror internal state, charging final image where stone rearranges into constellations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding eyes' riddle) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via flicker of brother's face and light surge narrowing to realization; agency in pouring sap and touching stone forecloses void-path with felt tear-cost. Escalation coherent under lens, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mosaic emotion/loss emerges organically from ritual alignment and brother's quote recalled in scene, reweighted in final "preservation wasn’t about freezing time but about letting it flow." Resonant non-literal answer via shifting mosaic without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (fractal cracks as emotion's math) and rhythmic modulation under pressure (short sentences in gasp/surge). Lyrical diction purposeful and consistent for conjurer; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "chips in the glass eyes began to resonate with the stone’s fractures" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm, coherent metaphors (dovetail/fractal). No loops, scaffolds, or overwriting in peak ritual beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxidermy eyes aligning cavern mosaic transforms loss trope via fractal emotion math, with risk-taking in lyric ritual payoff feeling inevitable from setup. Bold conceptual angle heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
