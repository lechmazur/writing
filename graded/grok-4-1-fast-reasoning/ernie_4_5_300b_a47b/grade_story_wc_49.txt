<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira's shift from solitary tinkerer to communal tender feels earned through embodied strain ("hands ached") and micro-choice to share responsibility, with grandmother's words anchoring interior conflict without dominating.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup from lyre pluck to threads pooling culminates in Charged Poise closure (sapling sprouts amid community), with legible cost in spent tendril and ongoing tending; oriented early in para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Verdant arbor and tools (lyre, tendril) constrain choices—highest branch for moon alignment, tendril's glow cues action—and charge final sapling image, with sensory evolution (wilting to bursting mushrooms) mirroring restoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore arbor's magic) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via tendril's spinning threads reviving elements, forcing Lira's endurance (ache ignored); cost visible in physical exhaustion and tendril's collapse, charging community reprise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of communal tending emerges organically from particulars (threads teaching dances, creatures joining), reweighted in sapling's growth and Lira's realization without statement; final image offers non-literal answer to isolation vs. shared magic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, with perceptual bias (tinkerer's eye for cogs/pollen) and rhythmic modulation under climax strain; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (fox's "Again tomorrow?" reveals bond).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion with action ("tendril unfurled... golden threads erupted"); minor motif repetition ("golden stories," "aligns") purposeful for textural lens, no loops dulling closure; rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes (moon ritual, spirit gift) transformed via tinkerer's ingenuity (spider-silk lyre) and communal payoff, with fresh synthesis in threads-weaving-rituals yielding sapling community; risk in quiet, ongoing closure heightens resonance.</comment>
