<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marin's contradictory hesitation before the exchange reveals impulses under pressure; prior insomnia-driven pursuit earns the worldview shift, with brooch pulsing as embodied cost in her veins.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as rain-led density builds to brooch exchange and canvas transformation; CR closure lands with conceptual cost in the note reweighting "threshed" to "grown."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rain "carving rivers through the island’s spine" constrains path to brooch discovery; sun "gilding the cliffs" charges final renewal image, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to thresh meaning tightens via stranger's offer, forcing canvas-brooch trade-off; haggard awe at pulsing brooch makes cost visceral, reweighting options under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final changed painting and note "*Meaning isn’t threshed. It’s grown. Like the tides, like the rain.*" deliver non-literal resonant answer, recharging island debris motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with painterly perceptual signature ("brushes dipped in starlight"); dialogue subtext carries riddle-pressure, distinct from wry internal voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates figuration into action ("ground the amber into pigment"); no loops or artifacts dull peak exchange or closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brooch as "catalyst" synthesizing post-wars renewal transforms drowned-land trope; exchange risks magical logic that pays off in painting's bridge image.</comment>
