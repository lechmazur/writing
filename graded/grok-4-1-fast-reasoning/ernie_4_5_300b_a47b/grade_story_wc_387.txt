<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong interiority via philosopher's bias toward absence and effort, embodied in net-mending and whisk-handling; micro-choices like whistling reply reveal values under textural pressure. Final laugh/startled grip on whisk earns endurance of hidden labor insight with conceptual cost. Minor lack of contradictory impulses prevents 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sensory whispers to firefly code CR, with one tightening at pattern recognition narrowing interpretive options. Orientation anchored early (parapet, harbor, dusk). Closure lands via final image repricing world design with undeniable conceptual cost of demure audacity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Parapet/whispers post-rain constrain movement and amplify sensory hierarchy (groan of tide, ivy rustle); recurring whisk/net charge final image. POV-filtered details (moon paths as patterns) mirror internal priorities without catalog. Body/tool (whisk tines catching light) shapes deciphering choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appreciating hidden effort) signaled early, texturally escalates via whistle exchange to firefly code deepening that crystallizes stance. One reversal (random lights → intentional code) forces realization with felt cost in laugh. Agency in whisk-tracing forecloses interpretive naivety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hidden labor emerges from particulars (net stitches, firefly pulses, whisk grooves) shifting to audacity at end without statement. Final image reconfigures absence into persistent design resonantly. No moralizing; complexity lingers in pattern's intentionality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable, perceptual signature (whispers, pulses, threads) biased to philosopher's notice; rhythm modulates from calm mending to quickened heart. Prose texture distinct, diction controlled for meditative intensity. No elision withholding; compression purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Varied rhythm propels via sensory integration; high density with multi-job lines (e.g., "tines caught the light, casting delicate shadows"). Minor metaphor density (liquid silver, silver threads) purposeful for textural lens, no muddle or loops at closure. Clean propulsion to dawn image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: firefly code as philosopher's pattern-language transforms meditative trope via net-mender's tactile lens. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes of perception without gimmick. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from whisk/net callbacks.</comment>
