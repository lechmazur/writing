<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene—trembling hands amid determination, hiss of "No" to failure, laugh of triumph/terror—earning the final entry with father's death as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: failed yoyo spin → wire/mercury adjustment → stone flare and lighthouse activation as Decisive Change, with island shudder as legible conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hunger stone grooves and damp sand constrain tactile choices; lighthouse beam merges with stone glow to charge closure image, sensory details selectively urgent under fog and tide.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unlock stone escalates via agency-driven tightening—first failure forces mercury/coil improvisation—foreclosing failed past with deeper hunger cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of inventive defiance emerges organically from yoyo reverse-engineering failures to feedback loop success; final "neatly inventive to the end" reweights fate's lock without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with clockmaker's perceptual signature in gear/cog focus; rhythmic prose modulates from muttered bitterness to exhilaration, diction biased toward mechanical invention.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "yoyo struck the sand, and the light vanished" varies rhythm without loops; purposeful figures like "devouring the darkness" enhance peak without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of counter-clockwise clocks, yoyo puzzle, and hunger stone transforms time/fate tropes; yoyo-mercury initiation feels inevitable, bold magical logic commits without retreat.</comment>
