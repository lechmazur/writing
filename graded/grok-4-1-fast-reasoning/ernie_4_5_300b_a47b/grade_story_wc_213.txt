<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lira's curiosity drives concrete micro-choices like prying the panel and alternating ropes, revealing humble competence under pressure; internal conflict subtle but embodied in her furrowed brow and racing mind. Veyra applies targeted pressure at the inciting shift ("agitating the storms"), forcing tactical adaptation. Final endurance of listening earns praise with visible arm ache cost, but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: muted thud → switch secondary rope → clouds churn → alternate ropes → harmony restored (Charged Poise RR closure with arm ache cost legible in "arms aching"). Orientation anchored early ("sanctuary’s edge... storm siren tester"). Single scene tightens meaningfully at cloud agitation, narrowing options without breaks; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Windblown tower and microclimates constrain choices (glue stiffness dampens tone, slick secondary rope enables switch), charging final image of rope as ally. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: Lira notices air thickness and wind shifts via professional ear. Sundial shadow tracks time, evolving with solstice hush; spatial choreography clear on spiral stairs and edge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (perfect solstice bell test) signaled early, tightens causally via stirred clouds forcing restoration trade-off. Agency in rope switch and alternation forecloses chaos path with felt physical cost ("arms aching"). Veyra's warning complicates without resolving; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of "favoring listening over noise" emerges organically from bell duet soothing clouds, reweighting solstice hush in final image without moralizing. Subtext in Veyra's "conductor... maestro" praise carries conceptual cost of elevated responsibility. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (ear-attuned to tones/microclimates); voice modulates rhythmically from hush to churning intensity. Brief dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("Not necessarily"), distinct from narration. No head-hopping; diction fits humble professional lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion (short sentences in rush to edge), high density in action beats; minor overwriting in "fractal patterns" and "howled like lost souls" slightly muddles peak clarity without touching closure. No loops or scaffolds; strong verbs anchor images like "clacking boots."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm-controlling bell in cloud sanctuary transforms trope via microclimate physics and rope mechanics; risk in storm agitation pays off in harmony reconfiguration. No derivative echoes; bold premise commits fully.</comment>
