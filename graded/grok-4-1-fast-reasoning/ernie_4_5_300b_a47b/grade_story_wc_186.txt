<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's retrocognitive gift roots motivation in embodied visions, with contradictory doubt and persistence culminating in the earned slam of the shard, foreclosing failure at felt cost of bled fingers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of alignments and visions builds to decisive change at "light erupted," with legible cost in prior days of bleeding effort; orientation anchors crisply in opening paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass pavilion constrains choices via humming walls and mosaic hollow, charging climax alignment and eruption; sensory hum and storm integrate purposefully without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rekindling tightens accumulatively through failed days to storm flicker forcing shard adjustment, with agency-driven slam yielding visible blood cost and narrowed options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of meaning in chaos emerges organically from shard visions and mosaic work, resonating in survivors' smiles, but final-paragraph articulation of "coincidences are not random" borders on explicit moralizing, diluting subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward tactile echoes and vibrations yields distinct lyrical texture; rhythmic modulation heightens storm pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and integrated sensory propulsion, but minor overwriting in stacked images like "skeletal wind chimes" and "rippling outward like a stone dropped in a pond" slightly muddles peak clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition, "shard of hush," and post-collapse beacon rekindling transforms collapse tropes via specific prism mechanics and hope-memory alchemy, risking bold lyricism that charges closure.</comment>
