<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied hesitation at orb and grandmother memory anchor, earning final shift; minor slip in stock "chest tightened" phrasing dilutes peak contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density tightening to orb-sinking CR (tears as cost in "Lila nodded, tears pricking"); orientation anchored early at temple edge; one deepening via spiral memory suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orb and pond constrain choice (secrets sink at dusk) and charge final image; selective sensory hierarchy (light/rustle filtered via Lila's hollowness) mirrors internal clear-out without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (connection via thread) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to writing secret (agency forecloses hiding path); cost legible in trembling hand and tears, charging dusk sink.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of shared secrets connecting emerges via spiral/orb particulars, resonant in final thrush reprise; Elara's "thread... courage to share" borders thematic echo but integrates via Lila's tears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (hollow heart shapes noticing spirals/orbs); dialogue subtextual (Elara pursues guiding); rhythmic lyricism modulates to charged poise at "liquid light" sink.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "twig... pulse" advances plot/atmosphere); minor overwrite in repeated "prismatic quiet" and metaphor stack ("petal-strewn crown") dulls early propulsion, no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostwriter at lily-pond temple transforms secrecy tropes via orb mechanics; risk in whimsical Elara heightens without gimmick, inevitable in orb-to-letter arc hindsight.</comment>
