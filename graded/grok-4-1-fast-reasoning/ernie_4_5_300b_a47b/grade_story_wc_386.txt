<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied reactions like "Kael’s breath caught" and "chest ached," with motivation rooted in careful truth-weaving that compels dream-diving; micro-choices like placing the globe earn the final reconfiguration. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal dream beats, tilting toward revelation over internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via dream fragments building density to Charged Poise closure when Kael places the globe, reconfiguring connections with felt conceptual cost in "fragile, enduring threads." Single scene anchors who/where/when immediately; one meaningful deepening via progressive dreams suffices. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glacier shrine's ice wall and candles constrain choices (pressing hands, globe placement) and charge final image with humming approval; sensory details like "rustle of wind through frozen reeds" filter through Kael's perceptual bias. Vivid, selective integration mirrors internal states without overt symbolism; micro-setting as recurring altar elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock ghost via globe/dreams) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through dream density tightening knowledge of love over blame, forcing stance crystallization in weaving truth. Agency in dream-entry and altar placement forecloses vengeful ghost path with emotional cost ("heart heavy with guilt" echoed). One decisive deepening suffices; cost legible in salvaged purity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fragile connections emerges organically from dream particulars shifting snow globe's meaning (pool, prison, mirror) to enduring love, resonating in final image without moralizing. Subtext in silences like ghost's murmur invites ambiguity on grief's cost. Protagonist arc inextricable from question; non-literal answer reweights premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (windows motif biasing notice) and rhythmic modulation from drifting mind to flared candles; poetic diction controlled, syntax reflects quiet intensity. No dialogue; purposeful compression in dream shards taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "warped glass catching... beacon" advances image, closure); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative density high in dream beats ("shimmering pool") borders overwriting without muddle or register drift, slightly dulling peak immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diving ghost-whisperer with dream-cameos transforms tropes via snow globe's evolving meanings; risk in accumulative lyric structure heightens quiet closure without gimmickry. Particular details like "silver smear" feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
