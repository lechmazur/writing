<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and micro-choices like dismantling wires reveal traits under pressure, with motivation intensifying to compel the final lift of the fragment. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously prevents 9+; competence dominates without deep internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from hum to surge, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure in the inert fragment clattering and river singing, with searing palm as felt cost. Orientation anchored early in tower city during lunar perigee; no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gorge mist and rusted spire constrain climbs and placements, charging final image as shadows retreat and veins pulse. Sensory selection (ozone, teeth vibration) reflects interpreter's bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to access hush tightens via flickering vision and system resistance, forcing agency in dismantling that narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in searing palm and fragment's expenditure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as potential emerges organically from hush surge and rebirth image, reweighting "beginning in every ending" without statement. Final river melody offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in frequency/hush notices; rhythmic prose modulates from tense adjustments to awed laughter. No elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels from "low hum reverberated" to spire shedding; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak surge beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of signal interpreter reviving city via hush transforms relic tropes; Hollywood fragment as mirror risks bold ingenuity, heightening stakes inevitably.</comment>
