<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity drives concrete micro-choices like measuring Mara and laying cards where rain falls, earning her endurance as teacher; Mara's jaw-clench and fractal tattoo reveal distinct traits under pressure. Internal conflict subtle in balancing precision against chaos. Final commitment from Mara feels motivated by shared mapping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solo card-laying to collaborative measuring, culminating in Charged Poise CR at dawn ("This is how we rebuild") with conceptual cost of scars-as-maps reweighting post-crash premise. Orientation anchored early in loft. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and damp floorboards constrain choices (cards laid where raindrops fall); tape's hook clicking integrates tactilely. Sensory hierarchy via Elara's pattern-noticing biases details purposefully. Final dawn bleed through glass charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping patterns to rebuild culture) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as Mara joins, narrowing to collective revolution; agency in Elara's teaching forecloses isolation. Cost felt in exposed "skeleton" of culture. No reversals needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of chaos-to-pattern emerges via tape-measured overlaps, not statement; subtext in Mara's conversion answers "survive?" with "rebuild." Final image (new cards, confiding silence) reweights scars as maps without moral. No tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable Elara-limited POV with perceptual signature (measuring echoes, geometry of fate); voice rhythmic, poetic diction controlled. Dialogue subtextual ("Hope?" "Not hope... Understanding"), advances stake naturally. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, but overwrought figuration in opener ("thousand inverted hourglasses") and occasional stacks slightly blur high-pressure teaching beat; no loops or scaffolds. Propulsion strong to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy, measuring tape, crypto-crash mapping transforms tropes organically; risk in poetic Accumulative build pays off in inevitable CR. Loft's "quiet revolution" feels bold, non-obvious.</comment>
