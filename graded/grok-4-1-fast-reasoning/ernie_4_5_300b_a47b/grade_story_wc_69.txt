<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clara's motivation to preserve vanishing arts drives inviting others, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal playing beat; idealized without genuine flaws complicating choices like hesitation over Elias's off-key sob. Elias applies pressure via violin but remains secondary without deeper status shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from Clara's solitude to choir tapestry; Charged Poise closure in rosette spinning with "something new could take root" lands legible conceptual cost of world's fraying. One tightening via Elias's raw note to steady play narrows discord to unity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rosette as recurring object charges final image, constraining musical choices; autumn leaves and dust motes integrate purposefully, mirroring internal harmony vs external fray. Sensory hierarchy reflects Clara's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harmony vs hatred's noise signaled early, escalates accumulatively via off-key sob to counterpoint plucking and choir growth under Clara's agency. Visible cost in "world frayed" charges final poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of subtracting noise for harmony emerges organically from playing and inviting, reweighted in final rosette spin without moralizing; "harmony was not the absence of conflict" borders on overt but anchors grandmother's lesson in concrete music.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature in musical noticing; dialogue natural/subtextual as Elias's "river song" advances memory stake. Rhythmic modulation supports pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but figurative density peaks early ("melted honey," "vine") without full pattern payoff risks slight overwriting; no loops, clean syntax varies rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic instruments denoting cultural resilience transforms preservation trope via rosette motif; risk in poetic accumulative build heightens stakes organically.</comment>
