<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses in "I’m not ready" whisper versus singing despite fear compel the transformation choice with felt cost of shedding humanity; micro-choices like dipping fingers reveal values hierarchy. Minor slip in fortune as somewhat unearned external nudge, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density buildup (scents, animal offerings) to on-page Resonant Reconfiguration closure in transformation and phoenix appearance, with legible conceptual cost of self-loss honored as rebirth; "she did not fight it" crystallizes stance. Orientation anchored early in orchard; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moonthorn petals, spice paste, and orchard soil embers constrain ritual choices and charge final phoenix image; scent hierarchy reflects Lira's beast-language bias. Sensory integration purposeful, mirroring internal shift without static catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reluctant bond-reforging tightens texturally via animal contributions and voice crack, narrowing to acceptance with agency in singing/dipping; cost of human loss viscerally felt in "skin prickled... bones shifted," charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of metamorphosis as rebirth emerges organically from fortune echo, scent bridge, and final bond image reweighting reluctance without moral state; ambiguity in self-loss lingers meaningfully. Minor directness in closing "fortune’s final truth" slightly tells resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with scent/perception signature ("fragrance, a language older than speech") modulates tightly under stress; POV stable, no leakage, rhythmic control heightens transformation surge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., spice wafting integrates method/action); rhythm varies, metaphors coherent ("noose," "tidal wave") without muddle in peak shift. Zero loops, strong propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune cookie in fairy-tale scents/phoenix rite transforms metamorphosis trope via olfactory beast-language; risk in cosmic tone heightens stakes organically.</comment>
