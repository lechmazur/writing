<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's skepticism motivates convergence and taste-sensing, with embodied tastes revealing internal shift; contradictory doubt yields to acceptance with regret cost. Minor slip: resolution in final lines lacks one final contradictory impulse acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as taste density and compass behaviors build to CR closure; needle freezing and Lira's reveal reconfigure premise with legible regret cost in final taste/image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora fracturing and lavender bending causally evolve with rumble, constraining Kael's kneeling and charging dimming closure image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Taste escalation (ozone to blood) deepens stake under Accumulative lens, narrowing knowledge to moments; agency in waiting/kneeling forecloses pure skepticism with ring-slip cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of balance (trees absorbing pain) emerges via sensory shifts and Lira's implication, resonating in aurora dim/breath-holding without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with taste/perceptual signature; dialogue subtextual ("not just people"), natural, goal-pursuing; rhythm modulates with intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion; varied rhythm, no loops; minor figurative density in opening purposeful without muddling peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Trees voting, taste-sensing, weather-carriers synthesize into inevitable CR; transforms anomaly tropes via grounded, cosmic logic risking bold world rules.</comment>
