<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation to uncork creativity rooted in traits and intensifies through hesitant-to-free strokes; embodied emotions (knees sinking, chest ache) and internal conflict (boy vs. portrait artist) compel the climax choice. Final sketching feels earned with visible cost of foreclosed stability. Minor backstory reflection (grandmother's whisper) anchors present without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from lock's pulse to painting's shadow-door, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) at "lock sprang open... dam had burst," with legible emotional cost in relief after confrontation. Orientation anchored early (cave, lock relic). One tightening via light-through-canvas suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal cave vividly selective (prismatic refractions, damp moss constraining knees), mirroring internal states (facets as eyes); light filters constrain painting choice and charge final shadow-door image. Sensory hierarchy artist-specific (grooves catching light). No white-room; evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncork creativity) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via freer strokes to lock-click, narrowing options with agency in fitting invisible keyhole. Cost felt in "suffocating" confrontation and foreclosed fear. Escalation coherent under lens, though internal over external.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of inescapable callings emerges organically from particulars (lock-pulse, shadow-door); final image ("truly seen") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting suppression without moralizing. Subtext in crystals leaning in, laughter fading. Complexity lingers in oblique darkness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (dials as mouth, facets as eyes); diction/rhythm modulates from hesitant to steady ("breath, steady and sure"). Prose texture artist-biased, no leakage. Experimental shadow-painting legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (strokes hesitant then freer); varied rhythm, no loops. Minor overwriting in opening cave description ("hummed... remembering") risks purple but integrates without obscuring closure. Clean syntax emphasizes climax click.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: unconventional painting-shadow method transforms artist-suppression trope organically; cave-lock-painting inflections inevitable from prior particulars. Risks bold metaphor (lock as mouth) heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
