<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's steady hands and decision to help reveal a grounded craftsman compelled by curiosity; final inward turn feels earned through prior sync. Limited contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene prevent 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from stranger's arrival to ritual sync and path reveal, landing CR closure in sextant's inward turn and Elias's realization—"boundaries... navigated"—with conceptual cost of reframed purpose legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frost-shimmer and thickening fog constrain ritual and charge path reveal; mirrors circle integrates tactilely, mirroring internal states via ripple without overt symbolism. Recurrent twilight frost recharges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to recapture dream tightens accumulatively via synced labor to ritual hum and path; agency in handing mirror forecloses erasure for navigation with felt reconfiguration cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Erasing boundaries reweights to navigation through concrete ritual and final sextant reversal; resonant non-literal answer in "new mirror... space between breaths" emerges organically without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias with poetic perceptual signature—"scent of starlight"—modulates rhythmically; sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("map the in-between").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion, density high in ritual beats; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("molten glass... midnight and memory") slightly muddles peak without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirror craft, runaway dream, and inward sextant reconfigures fantasy tropes via grounded ritual; glass mountains path risks bold imagery heightening stakes organically.</comment>
