<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion (chill down spine, trembling hands) and micro-choices (dipping program, jotting symbols) reveal obsession under pressure, earning final promise; minor slip in label-like "Clara’s motivation crystallized" abstracts a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: symbols accumulate via water, surge breaks pattern tightening to memorization; Charged Poise closure lands on-page in "I’ll finish it" with felt cost of drenching/slipping program, reconfiguring her stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Flooded pit constrains choices (wading, dipping reveals symbols, surge drenches); sensory details (sloshing boots, rippling water) filter through musician POV, mirroring internal hum; lantern shadows evolve causally, charging final thrum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel code/prove ghost) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via emerging pattern and surge reversal narrowing to mental etching; agency in kneeling/jotting forecloses doubt with cost of soggy loss, charging ending image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of in-between creation emerges organically from symbols bleeding and final promise, reweighting silence into potential; resonant non-literal closure in floating program/timpani thrum answers existence question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with musician perceptual bias (notes twisted into symbols, unstruck hush); distinct atmospheric texture in syntax/rhythm modulates tension, prose as character in "pause between movements" motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion overall, but figurative overload in peak surge ("gush...drenches," "theater sighed") risks coherence; minor hand-tremble/shake paraphrase loop dulls embodiment slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musician-ghost code in water-damaged relic transforms haunted theater trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from "in-between spaces" frame to finishing vow.</comment>
