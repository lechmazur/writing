<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's synesthetic interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses in luring echoes amid fraying harmony; motivation intensifies compellingly to dance. Flapper's recognition adds relational crucible without muddling single-POV focus. Final fade earns endurance with felt cost of erasure, scaled perfectly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via echoes intertwining into chorus, maze shifting, arrivals thickening tapestry to RR closure in converging clearing and blank coin. Orientation anchors early in orchard/maze post-closing. No orientation debt; cost legible in "Fool’s journey erased by the weight of collective possibility."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synesthetic sensory hierarchy (apples as twilight taste, melody as gold) filters POV bias, with maze/orchard constraining via shifts and convergence charging final image. Details evolve causally (fruit ripens, walls dissolve). Micro-setting coin as recurring object recharges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend fractures) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via reversed Wheel and crescendo narrowing to dance; agency in humming/pressing coin forecloses despair path. Cost unmistakable in fading amid applause, felt even as garden renews.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reprise stitching possibility emerges organically from particulars like violet-scented drifts and bleeding timelines, reweighted non-literally in blank coin and beyond-time applause. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "waiting for the next encore."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with synesthetic perceptual signature ("sound painted the air gold") modulates rhythmically under pressure; stable third-limited POV, minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("You’re… earlier"). Diction/rhythm heighten without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "melody spiraling outward like smoke" advances sound/color/action); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts. Minor figurative density in peak dance holds pattern coherence without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synesthetic ghost mending timelines via echoes/tarot coin synthesizes fresh angle on spectral reprise; risk-taking in textured accrual heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from coin's evolving symbols.</comment>
