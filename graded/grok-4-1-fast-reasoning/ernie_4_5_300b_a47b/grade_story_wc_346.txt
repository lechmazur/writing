<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory doubt and task-commitment act simultaneously in the singing beat, earning her flaw-embrace with embodied cost via trembling memories and steady voice. Interiority particularized through grandfather's workshop cues. Final renunciation of perfection feels compelled by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: nested patterns deepen from placement to vibration to shattering, reconfiguring time's end as lullaby with legible cost in "pane of hush began to crack" and puppet's porcelain raining. Single scene coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pane of hush and puppet constrain climax choices, charging final shattering image; sensory hierarchy (salt/decay to humming reverse-ticks) reflects Mara's clockmaker urgency. Lighthouse scars mirror flaws purposefully without symbolism shout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (gentle doomsday) signaled early, textural deepening via memory flood and doubt forces endurance-agency in singing despite fear. One tightening forecloses miscalculation path with felt cost in groaning lighthouse and global slowdown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of flawed beauty emerges organically from puppet cracks leaking light to final realization: "end wasn’t an ending... beautifully flawed." Resonant non-literal answer reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature in clock/gears bias; rhythmic modulation peaks in singing's "rough... weight of generations." Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "cracks leaking golden light" advances image/action/theme); varied rhythm propels to climax without loops or muddled metaphors. Minor elevated diction fits voice but borders register drift in memories.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of doomsday-as-lullaby via hush pane and flawed puppet transforms apocalypse trope; risk in fractal time mechanics heightens stakes organically, inevitable in shattering closure.</comment>
