<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's pyramid scheme backstory anchors her distrust of Voss and motivates the bolt-turn despite risks, with hesitation showing contradictory impulses before decisive action. Virtuous mischief enables the rule-bending climax. Dr. Voss applies targeted pressure without diluting her arc. Minor label-feel in backstory intro slightly limits interior specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: rising pressure and device message lead to bolt-turn DC, dissolving diamonds with legible death-risk cost in "We die." Single scene oriented early (farm/dome by para 1). One tightening via message narrows options. Closure reconfigures stakes cleanly on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bolt constrains climax choice (hand on it, turn despite cold vibration); mushrooms evolve (mutate to dissolve), mirroring pressure via glow shifts. Sensory hierarchy (glow, hum, condensation) filters through Mara's mycologist bias. Atmosphere tensions wonder/warning purposefully. No white-room; spatial clarity in dome/chamber/bolt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest/release before implosion) signaled early, tightens causally via device message forcing Mara’s agency in bolt-turn. Cost visible in Voss's "We die" and trembling diamonds. No coincidence resolution; pressure coheres to Charged Poise in stabilization. One reversal suffices at length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure-as-metaphor theme emerges organically from mushroom absorption, bolt-turn, and final "*Diamonds are a metaphor*" repricing without statement. Resilience arc ties to pyramid survival via particulars. Subtext in glitchy warnings invites ambiguity on dimensions. Final image (cobalt spores, grin) resonates non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (lie-spotting suspicion, embodied respirator fog). Voice texture (shadowseam, mycelium) modulates poetically under pressure. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("What did you do?"), advances stakes; distinct idioms (Voss manic, Mara wry). No head-hopping; rhythm tightens at turn.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density: lines layer action/atmosphere (e.g., "caps pulsed... trembled"). Rhythm varies (short hum sentences at climax). Minor metaphor density ("shadowseam," "exhaling") consistent/voice-led, no muddle. Slight glow repetition but propels; no loops/scaffold dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quantum-concepts-in-mushrooms premise synthesizes fresh (physical ideas mutate spores); bolt/device transform tropes organically. Risky poetic compression (glitchy metaphysics) heightens wonder without gimmick. Turns inevitable from established resonances; no template echoes.</comment>
