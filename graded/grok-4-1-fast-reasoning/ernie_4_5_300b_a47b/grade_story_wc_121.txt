<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between defier and grounded woman culminates in earned descent; gut tug embodies periodic power effectively. Minor epiphanic summary in converging timelines slightly undercuts micro-choice specificity at peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mosaic shards taught by first holographic fork hold Accumulative/Textural lens to CR closure; tablet crumbling and feet touching ground deliver legible conceptual cost in final paragraph. Orientation anchors immediately in viaduct scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Viaduct's glowing arches constrain path choices and charge dimming in final image; wet stones and alley cobblestones filter through Mara's floating bias with sensory economy. Recurring luminescence mirrors internal chaos purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to conquer self tightens accumulatively through timeline density, forcing trade-off in right-path choice; agency in retracing forecloses isolation with grounding cost on page. No reversal overload fits lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of embracing fractured selves emerges organically from timeline particulars, resonant in grounded walk reweighting premise without moralizing. "Darkening brightness" motif shifts from chaos to peace effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with floating perceptual signature (e.g., boots nearly touching slick surface); lyrical rhythm modulates from drift to grounding without slippage. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety supports propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops in "versions of herself" across timeline beats dull mid-density slightly. No closure-touching artifacts; high info density overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity defiance and temporal self-labyrinth transforms tropes; procedural life generation and "darkening brightness" feel inevitable in hindsight, risking bold mosaic without gimmick.</comment>
