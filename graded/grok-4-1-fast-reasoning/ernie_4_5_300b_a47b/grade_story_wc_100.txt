<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's stubborn resistance to Marisol's tales shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, earning his final choice to stay; embodied via trembling hands and scoffing at the note. Childhood dream epiphany borders unearned but anchors prior grief motif without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds from package dream trigger to lens activation DC, with legible cost in "My rest is here now" foreclosing surface life. Orientation anchors early via undertaker's doorstep; single transition to underwater coheres without shard overload.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Library dome half-buried in silt and floating lens shards constrain welding/scavenging choices and charge activation beam slicing water. Sensory brine air and kelp forests filter through Elias's priorities, evolving with silt to light spectacle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reviving lens vs. stubborn grief tightens via dream-forced descent and days of work, narrowing to activation agency with internal cost of softened purpose. Marisol's pressure coheres causally without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lens mended "with gold leaf, like scars turned to art" reweights grief-to-belonging theme organically, resonant in final explorers finding quill-traded man without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "hands stained with embalming fluid" trembling on shard; dialogue subtextual as Marisol's "You occupy impossible spaces already" persuades without declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm propels from "cacophony of pressure" descent to quiet "chased stillness" close; minor density in opening metaphors purposeful for tone, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure beam image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Undertaker occupying sunken library transforms grief tropes via lens bridge to knowledge, fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight from crate to quill trade.</comment>
