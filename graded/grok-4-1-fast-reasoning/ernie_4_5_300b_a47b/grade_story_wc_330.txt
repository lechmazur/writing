<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silent carpenter's motivation clear and persistent through actions like following echoes, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; micro-choices reveal values effectively without deep internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with motif density tightening to CR closure ("silence wasn’t an end. It was a beginning"), cost legible in courtyard reconfiguration; orientation anchored early, one transition legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (hush, bells, fountain ripples) filtered through Elio's perceptual bias guides choices like door push; recurring fragment and courtyard constrain singing beat and charge final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence to possibility) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fragment-to-song deepening with felt cost in hush's embrace; lacks sharper agency-driven reversal narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of renewal in quiet emerges organically from singing's ripple code and circle of flowers; final image offers resonant CR reweighting silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (silence as language); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to gleaming song, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful motif recurrence (hush, gleam), varied rhythm propels; minor figurative density in opening risks slight opacity but pattern-taught without closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carpenter's craft and lyric silence-interpretation in circus relic; halo-to-song turn feels inevitable from quiet persistence, transforms trope organically.</comment>
