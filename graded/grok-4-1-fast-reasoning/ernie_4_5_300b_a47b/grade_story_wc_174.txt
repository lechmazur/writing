<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through past eulogy compromise to on-stage reversal, with embodied serenity contrasting throat-tightening tension; micro-choice to reverse projection reveals values. Minor label-speak ("uncommonly serene") slightly abstracts peak delivery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as performance density builds to reversal and CR closure ("He’d found his method"), with felt cost in past lies foreclosed by new realization; orientation anchored early in dome. One tightening via audience scoff/reversal narrows assumptions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dome's ribs and curved wall constrain projections and fracture light, mirroring internal ethical blur and charging final exit under stars; sensory hush hums with projections' meteor hush. POV bias filters through calligrapher's rune-carved gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (test ethical storytelling) signaled early, escalates texturally via scoff ("half-truths") and reversal laugh, forcing stance crystallization with agency in projection flip; cost legible in uneasy crowd shift to release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of half-truths emerges via king/pauper swap and "shadows dance," resonating in final campfire image without overt moral; direct line "Half-truths are the only kind worth telling" borders statement (−0.4). Complexity lingers in raw post-argument readiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in rune-glow and ink-stained precision; dialogue subtextual (drifter scoff, Mara proverb) advances pressure naturally. Rhythmic modulation builds to serene close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density weaves action/prose (e.g., "runes flared, projecting"), varied rhythm; minor metaphor density in opening ("rusted crown, skeletal ribs") risks overwrite but pattern-taught. No loops dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligrapher's runes into holographic puppets transforms ethical trope via dome reversal; risk in subversive half-lights heightens stakes organically.</comment>
