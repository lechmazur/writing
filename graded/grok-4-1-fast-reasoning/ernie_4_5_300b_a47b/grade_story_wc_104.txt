<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to plant resilience intensifies credibly to compel vial hurl at climax; actions align with patiently strategic trait shown in key decoding. Limited internal contradiction—mostly resolute endurance without shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Earned change at chains snapping feels rooted in prior causality without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: wall collapse therefore decode keys therefore vault access therefore vial hurl as DC closure with legible cost (chains snap, scavenger pressure). Orientation anchored early (Lirael chained in carnival center post-wall). Single scene coheres with one tightening (scavengers approach narrows time).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory anchors (dust, cotton candy smell, rusted cuffs) filter through Lirael's urgent priorities; piano bench and chains constrain decoding choices. Carnival facade subtly mirrors hidden resilience, evolving causally to staircase descent. Final vines bursting charge closure image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (access seeds) signaled early, tightens via causal scavenger footsteps forcing vial hurl agency; cost visible in risked exposure and chain strain. Pressure coheres under causal lens without coincidence resolution. One reversal (bench opens) narrows options effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of chained resilience emerges organically from puzzle-solving to vines trapping scavengers; final image reconfigures dry soil promise non-literally. Subtext in arrow's fading glow implies cost of fulfillment without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from planting motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with consistent perceptual bias (symbols only she recognizes); voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm in descent ("air grew cooler"). No dialogue; diction fits urgent decoder without register drift. Perceptual signature in symbol-tracing specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., key insertions advance plot/character); rhythm varies for propulsion, but minor overwrite in metaphors ("liquid starlight") muddles peak vial grab slightly. No loops or scaffolds; strong verbs dominate. Minor template in key descriptions ("crescent moon... sunburst") dings without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of carnival relics (piano keys/arrow as map) transforms post-apoc tropes via specific decoding logic; feels inevitable in hindsight. Fresh inflection in vial hurl reweighting liberator title. Bold risk in magical seeds pays off without gimmick.</comment>
