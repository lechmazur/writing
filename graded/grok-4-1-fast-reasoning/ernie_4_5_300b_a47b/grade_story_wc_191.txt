<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lira's wisely adventurous paradox drives concrete micro-choices like pressing the shard into the mural and questioning the guardian, earning the self-realization closure with embodied fear ("hands steadied") contradicting resolve. Internal conflict layers impulses on-page without summary. Final pendant choice forecloses fear-paralysis path with legacy cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: mural peel therefore map, shard therefore stairs, question therefore face reveal and CR closure. Orientation anchored early (Lira, orchard behind waterfall). Stairway collapse provides legible conceptual cost in final chamber; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bioluminescent pears and ozone-elderberry air selectively filter through Lira's lore bias, constraining path to hollow tree and charging sunrise-painted orchard finale. Waterfall veil and pavilion wall guide choices tactilely. Recurrent pear glow mirrors ascension steps, evolving with dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sunrise stake tightens causally via sky-shift and flickering stairs, narrowing options; guardian trial forces agency trade-off (question over weapon). Escalation peaks in face-void placement, with bones and collapse as felt costs charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of legacy-as-mirror emerges via murals and self-face reveal, reweighting throne premise without statement. Final descent image answers "unclaimed" question resonantly: pendant claims internal throne, lingering ambiguity on village impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (prophecy-filtered noticing: "patterns that mirrored constellations"). Guardian dialogue subtextual ("Not blood, but truth"), goal-driven. Rhythm modulates tension, no head-hopping; minor register lift in murals but voice coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; opening metaphors ("hologram trapped in time") pattern-taught without muddle. Minor figurative density in descriptive beats (-0.3), but closure image clean. No loops; rhythm breathes with stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quest trope subverted into CR via peeling murals and self-queen reveal, synthesizing futuristic bioluminescence with ancestral nostalgia organically. Risky metaphor throne as mirror feels inevitable, heightening internal stakes without gimmick.</comment>
