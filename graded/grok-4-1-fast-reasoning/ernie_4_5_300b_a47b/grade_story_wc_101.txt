<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to bridge generations intensifies credibly through council pushback and bell-ringing choice, earning the community's shift with felt risk of exposure. Interiority concrete in grip on humming bell sensing resolve. Minor flaw: council skepticism summarized without embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of secret donations builds to open notes, with RR closure in arbor's transformation and Mira's widow exchange reweighting solidarity. Orientation anchored early in arbor/ridge/Mira. One tightening via bell ring forecloses anonymity without causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Arbor's tiles, wet clay, and sanctioned moon constrain gathering under curfew, charging final hub image; recurring bell as micro-setting evolves from silenced to singing. Sensory hierarchy fits Mira's priorities, integrated into action. No white-room; spatial coherence through pillars/base/beam.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sanctions vs. solidarity signaled early, tightens accumulatively when ringing risks ceasing donations but yields notes/mosaic. Agency in declaration forecloses hiding path with exposure cost legible in murmur/unease. Escalation coheres under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of naming vs. shadow emerges organically from donors' reveal to notes/stories, resonant in "I knew the giver... but needed you to know the receiver." Final arbor/bell image reconfigures fear-to-fluency without moralizing. Counter-reading in council grudge adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV on Mira, perceptual bias in noticing bell hum/patterns; voice textured with modulated rhythm, e.g., thin brittle tone cutting dark. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual: Mira's speech pursues declaration goal. No head-hopping; elision of runs taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm accelerates to solstice peak; opening anchors stakes via glowing tiles/bell dust. Minor overwrite in "hope frayed like old rope" but no loops/muddle touching closure; final line recharges motifs cleanly. Strategic telling compresses aftermath effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sanctions/exile with bell as intergenerational bridge, transforming anonymity trope via on-page risk. Arbor/bell evolution feels inevitable from particulars, not template. Bold in quiet RR closure over confrontation.</comment>
