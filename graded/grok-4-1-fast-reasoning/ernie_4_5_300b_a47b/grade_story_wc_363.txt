<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied actions like pressing the bead and chasing the crow; contradictory wistfulness drives persistence against isolation, earning the final renunciation when "Her grandmother’s bead slipped from her grip."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: puzzle assembly densifies ripples fraying silence, culminating in CR closure as beads merge and one floats away, with legible cost in the stilling loom before recommencement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bamboo forest and orchard constrain chase and cloth-draping; recurring bamboo charges final image as "leaves trembled... with the weight of unspoken words," mirroring internal states through tactile evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unravel silence tightens via puzzle progress and crow complication under accumulative lens; agency peaks in slotting final piece and bead sacrifice, with cost felt in fading light and lost bead.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial connection emerges organically from particulars like dissolving puzzle to twin bead; final weaving of silence offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting prior unraveling without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in thread/tapestry diction; rhythmic modulation heightens accumulative texture, legible despite lyric compression, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion without loops; minor figurative density ("sunlight dripped... liquid gold") purposeful for opening tone, no artifacts dulling closure image of trembling bamboo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puzzle-map cipher and silence-weaving transforms artifact tropes; risk in latent magic payoff feels inevitable from bead/puzzle particulars, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
