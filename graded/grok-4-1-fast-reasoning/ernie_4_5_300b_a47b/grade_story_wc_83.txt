<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in grief drives micro-choices like ignoring Orion and entering the node, with embodied contradiction in bitter laughs amid exhilaration. Interiority particular via geode's bite and breath hitches, earning her shift to seer. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "raw, unfiltered edge" slightly abstracts peak stress without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of veins/crystal images builds to Charged Poise closure with new crystal and internalized Orion as reconfiguration cost (observatory lost). Orientation anchored early in observatory/crater. Single scene causality intact via geode presses triggering scans/descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass cracks, ozone ash, and geode heat filter through Elara's bias, constraining descent and charging final veins-to-horizon image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to tactiles under crisis. Crater/node subtly guides choices without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tap unused potential) signaled early, tightens via unstable node under Accumulative lens as density forces entry trade-off. Agency in overriding breakers/Orion forecloses safety with felt cost in vortex scream and geode shatter. Escalation coherent without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of grief as awakening emerges via crystal evolution and node visions reweighting loss into refusal-to-die poise. Shouted thesis—"Unused potential... is anger. It’s grief"—in climax echoes too directly, flattening subtext (-0.4). Final image resonates without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias in fractal shadows and throbbing nodes; voice texture modulates from bitter to exhilarated rhythm. Dialogue natural/subtextual (Orion warns, Elara defies). No head-hopping; diction fits stressed survivor lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; laughs/shadows recur purposefully without loops. Minor overwriting in peak vortex (mixed "screamed"/"erupted" metaphors) slightly muddles without harming closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with alarms/lurches.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perturbation theory and intangibly tangible geode synthesize grief-sci-fi into fresh hunt frame, transforming tropes via node anger-reveal. Risky crystal-shatter risks reality collapse, heightening stakes organically. Hindsight inevitability in veins guiding onward.</comment>
