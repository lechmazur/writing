<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lila's embodied vibrations and micro-choices under numbness pressure reveal contradictory impulses; final emotional thaw earned by prior experiments. Minor therapy-speak ("emotional numbness") slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure ("silence wasn’t the absence... space where emotion could breathe"); orientation anchored early in cavern. One tightening at reversed playback frays numbness with felt cost in chest ache.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cavern drums and hides constrain via sympathetic vibrations, charging final drum gift image; sensory hush mirrors internal thaw. POV-filtered selectivity (vibrations over sound) purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant numbness stake signaled early, tightens via reversed music reversal narrowing to shared hush; agency in fitting wire, cost legible in tears/pricking ache charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-container emerges organically from hush vibrations and drum conduits; final CR image ("found her voice") non-literally reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in vibration bias; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Elias's grunts advance hush reveal). Rhythmic modulation under emotional peaks consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "hush" patterning; minor overwriting in metaphors ("palimpsest of emotion") but no loops dulling closure. Propulsion clear, varied syntax supports cadence shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deaf vibrations, reversed hush, drum hush transforms silence trope; risk in "audibly muted" wire inevitability charges CR without gimmickry.</comment>
