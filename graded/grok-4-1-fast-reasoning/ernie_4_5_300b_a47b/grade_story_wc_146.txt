<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Patience as core trait shown concretely in days-long vigil and minimal needs, compelling patient revival choices; motivation intensifies via accumulating footsteps. Interiority concrete but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene, limiting depth. Final endurance of departure earned with felt isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of footsteps builds to cadence shift reviving town. Closure as Charged Poise in "Kael sheathed the tuning fork, his work done" reconfigures options with conceptual cost of restored balance demanding endurance. Orientation anchored early; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (thrum, damp soil, rust) filter through Kael's auditory bias, mirroring internal states. Cobblestones and bell tower constrain choices, evolving causally; recurring tuning fork charges final image. Micro-setting (ground contact) guides revival tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revival) signaled early; accumulative escalation via footsteps from "faint" to "hundred," narrowing to bell's imperfect tone. Agency in repeated strikes forecloses force-based paths; visible cost in patient waiting charges final departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of mending via rhythm/listening emerges organically from particulars, reweighting machine-to-chorus contrast. Final image of lingering tone offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in harmony amid gaunt townsfolk invites ambiguity on sustainability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in rhythmic syntax and auditory perceptual signature; stable single POV with no leakage. Compression of days purposeful and legible under accumulative lens. Diction modulates with intensification, heightening pressure to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density integrates action/atmosphere; minor repetition of "struck" purposeful for pattern. No loops or artifacts dull closure; strong verbs propel without overwriting in peak revival beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tuning fork reviving ghost town via footsteps feels inevitable, transforming revival trope through rhythmic logic. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes; final bridge-tone image memorable and organic.</comment>
