<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (hide scars vs reveal through poetry) act in scene via embodied ache and micro-choice to write raw poem, earning final renunciation of half-truths with exposure cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase to CR closure in sealing poem, cost legible in "scars aching" amid storm peak and mailing risk; orientation anchored by para 1; one tightening via envelope reveal suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Storm and dome constrain vigil (rattles windows, ash-clogged mask), observatory tools (lantern, timer) charge final image; selective sensory hierarchy (roiling clouds, flickering flame) mirrors internal fury/tranquility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rarefy poetry vs censorship) tightens via envelope's mirror-poem deepening knowledge, forcing raw writing agency; storm cadence shift narrows options with felt exposure cost in sealing for "publisher who dared."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scars/masks/rarefy motif emerges organically, reweighting premise in final "clear, unblinking, eternal" image as non-literal answer to hiding pain; complexity lingers in furious tranquility without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (scar-traced stars, storm as breath); rhythmic modulation peaks in poem's charged poise; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to storm peak, but minor figurative density (e.g., "liquid mercury" to "divine signature") borders overwrite in reflective beats without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scars-as-cartography and rarefy-poetry transforms dystopian censor trope via stormlit vigil; envelope poem turn inevitable from early gnaw, risking bold raw exposure.</comment>
