<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied actions like tracing stone and gripping prism, with doubt emerging in pivotal vision beat; motivation rooted in mentor dismissal drives choices credibly. Minor diagnostic edge in "creeping doubt" and "sickening lurch" slightly abstracts peak emotion without full contradiction in scene. Earned renunciation at "tucks it away, her mind at peace" forecloses validation path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: emotional density builds from prism channeling to arbor pulse, shattering frost breaks pattern for CR closure. Orientation anchored early ("quartz arbor...morning mist"); cost legible in "assumptions had shattered alongside the frost." Single scene causality tight, no slips touching revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quartz arbor and car frost constrain choices—traces veins on window, steps into arbor pulsing light—charging final image of "silent sentinel." Sensory hierarchy mystic-specific (fractals, shadows conversing); mist evolves causally, mirroring internal hush. Environment shapes climax shatter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove emotion absorption) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via raw visions to shattering reversal narrowing options to self-doubt. Agency in channeling forces trade-off; cost viscerally felt in gasp/stumble, charging peace. Minor abstractness in initial objective vs. on-page test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of projection vs. true absorption emerges organically from visions mirroring "her own yearning," reweighting premise in CR laugh/"secrets safe." Final image non-literal answer to validation quest; ambiguity lingers without moralizing. Resonance from frost/arbor particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with mystic perceptual signature ("frost etched fractals," "shadows seemed to hold conversations"); diction/rhythm modulate to intensity at shatter. Lyrical texture purposeful, no head-hopping or withholding; compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm ("crystalline branches piercing...like frozen lightning"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak shatter beat. Propulsion clear, specifics replace generics ("veined stone," "amber light"). Minor overwriting in opening simile density, but purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystic realism: quartz mirroring emotions via frost/prism defies trope, inevitable in hindsight from grounded trait. Risky CR closure transforms premise without gimmick; voice/setting cohere authentically. Transformation test passes—irreplaceable arbor logic.</comment>
