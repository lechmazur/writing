<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to map distances and thresholds intensifies through micro-choices like analyzing grain and writing her code, earning the closure step with embodied resolve; interiority concrete via logbook and wood patterns. Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses shown simultaneously caps below 9; father's brief appearance applies pressure effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from terrace patterns to field paths to door CR, with cost in terrace's chaos snap-back and non-revisitable thresholds. Orientation anchored early (Lira on drifting terrace above cornfield); one tightening via hum/path reveal suffices, closure reconfigures codes as personal language.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prism refractions, wood grain spirals, corn stalks as compass needles constrain choices (grain guides descent/path); body/attention to railing and logbook charge final writing image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (architectural analysis); evolves causally with alignment/hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel codes/thresholds) signaled early, tightens via intuition/path to door with agency in analysis/step-through; cost legible in foreclosed revisits and earned codes. Escalation accumulative under lens, but minor abstractness in "sacred gaps" before embodiment slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacred thresholds as gaps emerges organically from grain/codes/prisms, resonant CR in door step and self-written codes reweighting premise without moralizing. Final image ("grain pointed true") answers question non-literally; complexity in distances as prayer/home.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (noticing grain/codes); voice texture lyrical yet controlled, modulating rhythm with pressure (short sentences at hum/door). Dialogue sparse/natural, subtext-laden ("You found the code"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (long descriptive to short revelation beats); density high, metaphors coherent (prisms/kaleidoscope to mosaic face). Minor overwriting in repeated hush/fractured motifs dulls one peak slightly; no loops, clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: weather codes as time ripples, grain navigation in drifting surrealism transforms maze trope; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes, inevitable door from particulars. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
