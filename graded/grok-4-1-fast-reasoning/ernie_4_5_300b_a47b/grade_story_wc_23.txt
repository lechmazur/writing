<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to map loss drives consistent micro-choices like using her hair in the antenna, embodied in trembling hands and streaking tears; minor abstraction in "raw solace of the task" slightly distances peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with building density of calls and instructions toward Charged Poise closure at spinning censer foot and chorus; cost legible in "tears streaking her dirt-smudged cheeks" reconfiguring certainty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Censer foot as micro-setting constrains choices (tracing etchings, centering antenna) and charges final spin; sensory selectivity sharpens via POV like "smell of burning insulation" mirroring urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reverse migration tightens accumulatively through iterative calls narrowing to building action; agency in obedience forecloses doubt with visible cost in physical labor and tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of loss navigated via memory emerges organically from censer callbacks, culminating in resonant final image of spinning foot reweighting "geography of loss" without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in cryptic, tactile noticing ("tide dragging pebbles"); sparse dialogue natural and subtextual, advancing via grandmother's voice fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied syntax and sensory propulsion, no loops; minor overwrought metaphors like "skeletal fingers" consistent in gothic texture without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of navigator lore and censer as memory key transforms ghost-signal tropes; fresh "reverse migration" premise risks poetic compression payoff at humming chorus.</comment>
