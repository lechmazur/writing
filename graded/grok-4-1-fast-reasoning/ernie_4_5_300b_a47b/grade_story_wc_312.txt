<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's micro-choices in tilting the bell under exhaustion reveal contradictory impulses of naive hope and physical limit, earning his endurance with felt cost. Marla's skepticism applies precise pressure without overwhelming. Internal voice stays concrete and particular, avoiding labels in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through drip adjustments to Charged Poise closure at "air shimmered... rift seemed to stitch," with legible cost in collapse and "not perfect." Orientation anchors viaduct/sea/dawn by para 1. Single scene causality tightens options via sync.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct's glass curve and baking sun constrain scaffold climb and positioning, charging final image of edge-sitting watch. Sensory drip/hum/vibration hierarchy fits mage's priorities. No white-room; evolved with sun's climb.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rift heal via bell sync) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through tweak failures to protagonist-agency tightening at drip metronome. Cost unmistakable in hands shaking, collapse; forecloses perfect fix.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Brittle devotion emerges organically from persistence vs. Marla's doubt and flawed success, resonating in final "fragile, flawed... faith" without statement. Closing image reweights premise: balance over cure. Ambiguity lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature biases to drip/tide rhythms; dialogue subtextual (Marla's softening) advances pressure. Rhythm modulates with stress compression in adjustment beats. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in drip sequences; no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Metaphors purposeful ("frozen light," "heartbeat") without muddle. Read-aloud rhythm peaks at sync hum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mage tinkering cosmic rift via oxidized bell/drips transforms tropes organically. Final reconfiguration ("madness is just devotion") inevitable from particulars. Risks quiet impossibility tone effectively.</comment>
