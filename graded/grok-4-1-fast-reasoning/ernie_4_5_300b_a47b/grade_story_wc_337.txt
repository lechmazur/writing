<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is embodied (fingers ache, weight lifts from chest) with contradictory fear and persistence driving micro-choices to unravel despite risk; earned change links her mask-mending past to fisherman's silence. Elias applies relational pressure via riddles and touch. Minor epiphany slip ("lucid...awake") borders stock but doesn't unmotivate closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from stubborn knot to whispers to light burst/key, with on-page RR (net vanishes, hush to hum) and legible cost ("burden she hadn’t known she carried" lifts, reconfiguring silence). Orientation anchored early (sanctuary, net, starlight). Single scene, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary's glass refracting starlight constrains and charges climax (burst illuminates, end brighter/dancing); net's salt/memory/barnacles tactile via fingers/needle. Sensory hierarchy (visual shimmer, audible whispers) filters through Mara's urgency. Micro-setting (needle, floor) guides unraveling choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel net to ground spirits/break hush) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via faster needle, louder chorus, burst; agency in persistence forecloses silence path with felt cost (unleashed hum, personal burden lifted). One tightening sufficient; Elias complicates via backstory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (silence as prison vs. listening) emerges from particulars: net's knots to key, masks to unasked pain; final image (stars' promise, ready to listen) resonantly reweights hush without stating moral. Subtext in Elias's riddles and Mara's fear. No preachiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (net's shimmer as voices); voice texture poetic yet grounded (rhythm modulates from hum to buzz). Dialogue natural/subtextual ("key to a door that was never locked"); distinct idioms (Mara direct, Elias riddling). No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short peak sentences in unraveling); purposeful repetition ("hush," "silence") taught as motif without loops. Minor overwriting in "interlaced hush grew louder, a chorus" but propels. Clean syntax, no artifacts dulling burst/closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mask restorer unravels spirit-net hush in prisms transforms ghost/redemption tropes via accumulative silence mechanic. Risky poetic conceit ("accumulates silence") inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes to personal lucidity without gimmick.</comment>
