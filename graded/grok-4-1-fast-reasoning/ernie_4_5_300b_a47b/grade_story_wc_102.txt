<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via memory and vial, compelling journey choices; interiority concrete in embodied warmth/breaths, but epiphany at pool veers toward unearned summary of collective emotion without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from vial drop to pool realization; CR closure lands on-page ("love... waited for the right moment") with felt journey cost; orientation anchored early, one tightening via light trail suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (moss-slick path, glowing petals, still pool) filter through artist's priorities, constraining path-following and charging final viaduct sigh image; recurring light trail mirrors internal shift purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate unused love) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through breaths/visions narrowing to pool CR with emotional surge cost; agency in deliberate exhales/exploration forecloses documenting-only path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unused love's storage emerges organically from breaths/pool ripples to resonant CR answer ("spaces between breaths"); no moralizing, ambiguity in pilgrim tie lingers with counter-reading potential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in light/shadow/breath noticing; poetic diction/rhythm modulates with intensity, purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, varied rhythm passes read-aloud; minor overwriting in dense metaphors ("embers carried on the wind") during peak but purposeful and un-muddled at closure; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera obscura art, spiritual relic, and "unused love" storage transforms quest trope via breath mechanics; risk in lyric accumulation heightens CR without gimmickry.</comment>
