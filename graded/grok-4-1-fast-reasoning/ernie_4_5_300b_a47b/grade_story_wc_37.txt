<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied exhaustion at end ("hoarse, never wavered") earn endurance with cost, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure as Charged Poise in final image ("mica windows burned like tiny suns") with legible cost ("exhausted but peaceful", fragile memories).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mica windows constrain choice (presses palm to draw melody) and charge closure ("glowed, their light a tapestry"); vivid, selective sensory integration via POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle realm) tightens accumulatively via humming ignition; agency in conduit actions forecloses endless night with hoarse exhaustion cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory-knitting emerges organically; final beacon image non-literally answers light/memory balance, reweighting mirror worlds without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature ("mica rippling like water"); stable single POV, rhythmic modulation heightens humming pressure cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but dense metaphors ("time pooled like mercury") verge on overwriting without peak payoff, slightly dulling early momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical memory orchard transforms fantasy tropes; mica/song logic feels inevitable, risk-taking in lyric fantasy heightens resonance.</comment>
