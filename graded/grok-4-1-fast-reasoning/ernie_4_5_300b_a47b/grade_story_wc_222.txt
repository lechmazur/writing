<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent motivation rooted in chivalrous traits compels swaps under rising pressure; embodied reactions like "hair stand on end" reveal character. Final endurance as guardian earned via prior causality. Minor slip: backstory telling slightly abstracts "apprentice of wonder" without deeper contradiction in pivotal freeze moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each swap triggers groan/tremble/whine/shake, narrowing options to final king swap. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (spire ledge, wrong sky). Closure DC lands on "He swapped the kings... sky cleared" with legible cost in prior violent shakes risking collapse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details selective/POV-biased: slick ledge constrains grip, trembling ice pressures swaps, bioluminescent glow spotlights chessboard. Pocket sundial charges final image ("warmed against his skin"), reconfiguring as reminder. No white-room; spatial choreography coherent from ledge to descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (amend imbalance) signaled early, escalates causally via swap reactions culminating in "chamber shook violently." Protagonist agency in proceeding despite tremors forecloses collapse path with on-page cost. One tightening sufficient; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of swapping familiar for mysterious emerges organically from chess heist and secrets; final sundial reprise reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance in "courage to swap... for the mysterious" ties to actions, invites ambiguity on thief-to-guardian arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with thief's perceptual bias (notices relics, constellations). Voice texture distinct in fantasy rhythm, modulates tension ("fingers flew"). No dialogue; compression purposeful in ascent/descent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density: lines integrate action/atmosphere (e.g., "boots muffled by moss"). Varied rhythm accelerates in climax shakes. Minor overwriting in chess piece list, but no loops or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: magic chess heist as balance puzzle transforms thief trope via wonder secrets. Risk in playful stakes amid collapse threat heightens organically; final guardian reweight inevitable from prior pattern.</comment>
