<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's curiosity overrides fear in pendant twist, embodying illustrator's pattern-noticing traits; final drawing earns change via prior tunnel visions with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain from pendant flare to fissure and tunnel entry tightens options; CR closure in sketch reconfigures time premise with tumble-back cost legible in "tumbled onto the rooftop."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rooftop railing and backward ripples constrain lean-in choice; pendant as recurring object charges final cooling image, filtering through illustrator's sensory priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Assignment curiosity stakes deepen via voice riddle forcing pendant twist agency; tunnel return stumble forecloses safe observation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tunnel threads reweight "interrupted cadence" into echoes-born theme; sketch of guardian giant offers non-literal answer to time-loom premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with illustrator's perceptual signature in "waves moved backward, then forward, then sideways"; rhythmic modulation heightens time-lurch pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Varied syntax propels fissure-to-tunnel sequence without loops; minor "she saw" cluster in visions contained, density high in embodied actions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Giant-nap canals and time-uncaging pendant synthesize fresh CR; illustrator's ink-capture risks quiet resonance over confrontation.</comment>
