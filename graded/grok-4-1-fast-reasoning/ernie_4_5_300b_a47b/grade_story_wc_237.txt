<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (trembling hands vs. carving rune) act simultaneously; final scar transformation earned by prior failures and ritual risks, with embodied cost in itching scars and soul-shard fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual density builds to rune flare as Charged Poise RR; cost legible in "platform shuddered" moment, foreclosing failure path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating platform constrains carving choice and charges descent image; mist, ink veins mirror internal scars through scholar's biased sensory filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scar transformation) signaled early, tightens texturally via crystallization and shudder; agency in quill-scrape forecloses hesitation with felt soul-risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Scars-as-witnesses image reweights "breath between storms" premise without statement; emergent from ritual particulars, lingering ambiguity in ongoing questions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with rune-scholar perceptual signature ("liquid starlight" ink); rhythmic modulation under stress, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels to closure; minor figurative density ("fractal patterns") coherent without muddle in peak rune-flare beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rune scars as stories transforms ritual trope organically; fresh synthesis of quill-relic and forest applause inevitable from established fear-stake.</comment>
