<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias's observant trait drives concrete micro-choices like using the barrel for vibrations and sifting papers, earning the final engagement with ghosts. Interiority feels embodied in "weightless burden pressing against his chest," but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Final understanding feels credible but borders on tidy epiphany without deeper flaw confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns build to ceiling discovery, ghosts fade as CR with legible emotional cost in "chest tight with the weightless burden." Orientation anchored early in ticket office elevator shaft. Single continuous scene with one tightening via hidden compartment reveal suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dust swirls and ceiling cracks constrain choices, charging final image as portals to history. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: technician notices accumulation patterns others miss. Atmosphere vivid in "shadows stretch like old, thin hands," mirroring ghosts without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free trapped ghosts via observation) signaled early, escalates texturally through pattern analysis to compartment find, narrowing to emotional acknowledgment. Agency in climbing and listening forces stance crystallization. Cost felt in shaking legs and tight chest at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden stories/cracks emerges organically from dust analysis and photo reveal, reweighting premise in final ghost release without statement. Subtext in clown's smile matching smudged child enriches emotional aftereffect. Resonant non-literal answer in repaired stories vs. lingering burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in precise observations like "dust accumulation patterns—a swirl here, a ridge there." Voice texture consistent, modulating poetically under stress. Minimal dialogue natural: "Thank you" as rustle carries closure weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, propulsion strong in action integration like "knocked gently, and the plaster gave way." Minor artifact in repeated "patterns" phrasing and dust synonym churn dulls one beat. Closure image clear without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: watchmaker relic aids ghost detection in circus elevator repair, transforming tropes via dust forensics. Non-obvious angle on seeing ghosts through mechanical precision. Risk in metaphorical cracks pays off at historical reveal.</comment>
