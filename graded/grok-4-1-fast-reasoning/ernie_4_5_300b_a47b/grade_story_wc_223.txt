<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as crisis actor-survivor roots her persistence, with embodied scars and blurred grief/art driving micro-choices like reverse-walking. Internal contradiction emerges in her refusal to let ghosts dictate, culminating in earned realization she's the pawns. Minor flaw: some traits like "benevolently ruthless" feel label-adjacent without full trade-off visibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual walking density builds to third-night click ("The chessboard’s king toppled... soft click"), reverse pattern triggers reconfiguration, CR closure via self-unbinding with scars' ache as felt cost. Orientation anchors early; one tightening suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Whispering gallery's acoustics amplify footsteps into questioning whispers, constraining her pattern and charging climax hum. Chessboard as micro-setting evolves from obsession to carried prize, mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy (steps, fogged breath, bone-hum) filters via her ritual urgency; spatial coherence flawless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbind board for gesture-history) signaled early; accumulative pressure via growing whispers/nights narrows options, tightening at king-topple forces agency in reverse-walk. Cost legible in reconfiguration's reconfiguration and scars' ache. Minor abstractness in penumbra dilutes one beat's visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of pawns' revolutionary gestures emerges organically from board's pawn-less vulnerability to Elara-as-pawns realization, reweighting history's rememberers. Final image ("history... by the pawns who dared to move") offers non-literal CR answer without moralizing. Subtext in luminous absence charges quiet resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature (eyes' "quiet weight," steps as syllables). Voice modulates rhythmically, prose texture distinct via smoke/sound curls. No dialogue; purposeful compression in ritual beats taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short click sentence punches). Minor figurative density in opening ("sound curled like smoke") risks overwrite but doesn't muddle peaks. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; propulsion clear to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: footsteps-spelling ritual on pawn-less chessboard transforms crisis/performance blur into pawn-history premise. Risky lyric accumulative design heightens stakes via interregnum liminality, inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
