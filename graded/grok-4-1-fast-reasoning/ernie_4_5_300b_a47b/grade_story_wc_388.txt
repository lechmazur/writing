<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to excavate truth drives micro-choices like reassembling letters and placing the diamond, with hesitation revealing internal contradiction; final renunciation earned by rising stakes, though some interiority edges toward stock phrasing like "intuition screamed" at fissure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore progression from root inspection to letter reassembly to fissure opening; on-page DC closure as flawed diamond seals stillpoint with legible cost in chamber tremble and world shift, tightening options decisively without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Wasteland orchard setting vividly filters through Mara's observant gaze, with dust storms and leaning trees constraining center-clearing choice and charging final dawn image of relaxing branches; sensory details purposeful, no white-room drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of averting boundary collapse signaled early and tightens causally via letters' revelation, forcing agency in diamond placement; hesitation crystallizes moral trade-off with visible cost in dimming flawless diamond and spreading risk foreclosed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of dangerous truths emerges organically from pattern-seeking to sacrificial sealing, with final image of crunching grit reweighting comfortable lies without moralizing; orchard's sigh offers resonant non-literal answer to excavation's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in "truth excavator" bias and wasteland idiom; rhythmic control modulates tension, diction biased toward patterns and grit without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like dust storms swirling into clearing action; varied rhythm propels to closure, minor simile density ("miniature suns") in opener doesn't obscure peak fissure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Flawed diamond keyed to stillpoint transforms post-apoc tropes via stasis-leak fertility and decoy twist; fresh synthesis of conspiracy-debunking with dimensional risk feels inevitable in causal arc without derivative echoes.</comment>
