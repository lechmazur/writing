<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's fear-to-action shift and Lumen's telepathic kindness compel higher-stakes choices like threading the pedestal; interiority concrete via embodied sensations and projections. Final sacrifice realization earned by causal build. Minor telling in emotions slightly dilutes embodiment under peak revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with revelation density tightening to CR closure—Mara drinks ampoule, reweighting certainty to nuance with conceptual cost of grandmother's lingering sacrifice legible in "a choice to linger in the in-between." Causality intact from Lumen's visions to pedestal breach; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent algae and silt-cracked pedestal constrain choices (gloves slick with algae force threading) and charge final garden-shudder image. Sensory details (teal/violet hues, groaning stone) evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grandmother's fate/cure) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through three revelations narrowing to ampoule-drinking agency; cost felt in blight's threaded receding and foreclosed tragedy view. One tightening sufficient, charges closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of nuance-into-certainty emerges organically from particulars (foxglove transformation, garden laboratory); final "even in decay, there is room for growth" reweights premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity of forgotten secrets.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Mara with clean telepathic impressions; perceptual signature oceanic/magical (pulsing light, mind-pressure) modulates rhythmically under stress. Voice texture distinct in syntax evoking underwater flow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "foxglove’s poison transformed by time into something else" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies purposefully, no loops or artifacts dulling closure. Minor overwriting in opening descriptions contained pre-pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obsidian statue guardian and blight-catalyst serum transforms underwater ruin tropes; cascading telepathic revelations feel inevitable from established magic-science logic.</comment>
