<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's contradictory impulses (madness as clarity without filter) act in scene via persistence against dismissal, earning her final ritual choice with Jax's softening as relational cost. Awkward confidence blooms organically into fierceness without stock epiphanies. Minor label ("awkwardly confident") slightly under-shows tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hum density increases to peak alignment, delivering on-page Resonant Reconfiguration in stones flaring and voices roaring, reweighting rebellion from embers to storm with felt cost of prior silence broken. Orientation anchored early in spaceport bay with Lira. One tightening via Jax's involvement suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stones constrain ritual choice and charge final flare image; bare feet tactile on cool floor root Lira amid rubble. Sensory hierarchy (hum in veins, ozone wind) reflects stargazer's bias. Atmosphere mirrors internal shift from cobweb silence to thunderous wind.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reignite via meaning) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through hum swelling and rebel gathering to roar, narrowing options via alignment timing. Lira's agency in ritual forecloses doubt-path with cost of exposed "madness" paying off in collective response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (chaos rhythm/meaning in mess) emerges via stones' resonance shifting from dismissed decor to signal, answered non-literally in roar without moralizing until final line. Subtext in Jax's skepticism tests pattern recognition. Slight directness in "The mess had meaning" dings peak resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with Lira's perceptual signature (symbols glowing through scratched lenses); voice poetic yet grounded ("hum pulsed in her veins"). Dialogue distinct/natural: Jax's snort vs. Lira's "patterns." Rhythm modulates to peak wind/roar.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "sky bled from amber to violet" sets atmosphere/POV); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops/artifacts. Metaphors coherent/selective. Clean grammar, strong verbs propel to closure roar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystic stones in gritty spaceport rebellion, transformed via barefoot stargazer's opera-glass ritual risking "madness" for alignment payoff. Non-obvious angle on lull via cosmic hum reconfigures tropes organically.</comment>
