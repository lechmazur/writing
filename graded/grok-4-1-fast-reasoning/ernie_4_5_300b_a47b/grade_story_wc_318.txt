<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in restoring laughter drives embodied persistence to exhaustion and tears; contradictory hope amid sunken eyes earns final collapse. "Mournfully eager" label diagnostic without full scene contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density from faint shimmer to burst reconfigures silence with exhaustion cost; on-page DC at "burst of light filled the tunnel" legible. Orientation anchored early in tunnel details; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tunnel's slick walls and flickering bulb constrain maceration efforts; body/tool (blistered hands, frayed cord) charge final purr. Sensory sound hierarchy reflects POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens accumulatively via renewed vigor narrowing to collapse; agency in yanking/singing forecloses quitting with blisters "left blisters on his palm". Cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of tending joy emerges via echoes from particulars, resonant in "thousand tiny voices" reweighting premise without moral. No tidy resolution; ambiguity in unconventional method lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with sound-biased perceptual signature; voice texture modulates from reedy warble to thunderous roar. No head-hopping; rhythmic control under stress consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repetitive "macerate" phrasing and synonym loops ("growl reverberating", "roar") dull mid-escalation density; minor scaffold in descriptive stacks. Rhythm varies but template cadence in action beats −0.6.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leaf blower as laughter conduit fresh synthesis; risk in surreal tunnel symphony inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
