<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation roots in grandmother's prophecy and dream haunting, embodied in burning lungs and frantic staccato; contradictory doubt persists post-dissolution, earning charged endurance at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: notes build density through negative space to figure's dissolution; Charged Poise closure reconfigures veil as intact with Elias's slumped exhaustion legible in final grotto hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism atrium constrains and charges climax by humming/flaring in response to saxophone, mirroring internal stakes; mist-slick walls and moss provide tactile negative space for musical tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to hush prophecy tightens via figure's "code is broken" riddle forcing intensified playing; agency in endurance narrows options, with physical cost (lungs burning) unmistakable at dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hushing truths emerges via negative space dissolving code; final dewdrop/dawn image non-literally reweights prophecy as postponable, lingering ambiguity without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with musical perceptual bias (notes as "whisper of absence"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, distinct from figure's choral whispers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm propels from mournful cry to wail without loops; minor overwrite in "colors bleeding into white-hot light" slightly blurs peak but pattern serves musical texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of saxophone-as-weapon via negative space transforms prophecy trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens eerie closure without gimmick.</comment>
