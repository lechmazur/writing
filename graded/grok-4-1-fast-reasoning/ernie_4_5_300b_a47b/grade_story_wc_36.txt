<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to harvest insights from failure drives concrete micro-choices like discordant playing; contradictory impulses peak in roaring "Enough!" amid visions of past selves. Earned renunciation via broken flute and surrender rune forecloses mastery path with felt cost. Mentor specter applies targeted pressure on riddle without flattening agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from flute note to chamber visions to silence realization; orientation anchors in first paragraph (relic keeper, Thunder-Echo Range). Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on "power lies not in its sound, but in its silence" with legible cost (irreversible broken reeds). No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Driftwood markers constrain navigation and charge final rune etching image; canyon hush and ozone filter through Kael's priorities, evolving with fissure and starfield bleed. Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress (rippling air, pulsing symbols). Micro-setting (flute, obsidian stairs) guides descent choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (insights from failure) signaled early tightens via discordant play triggering visions reversal, narrowing to silence endurance; agency in breaking flute forecloses sound-based mastery with on-page cost. Accumulative pressure coheres without coincidence resolution; visible trade-off in reed snap alters resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of unmaking failure through surrender emerges organically from discordant notes to air-born silence; final driftwood rune offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Past selves shadows and moth swarm subtextually layer complexity, inviting ambiguity on mastery cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (rune-only driftwood); lush diction modulates rhythm from hush to shuddering walls under stress. Sparse dialogue cryptic/natural ("Unmake what?"), pursuing goals with subtext; no head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied syntax, but figurative density overwrites chamber peak ("tapestry of grief... bled into a starfield... swarm of moths"), dulling propulsion slightly (-0.4). No loops or scaffolds; high density integrates sensory advances. Clean mechanics, purposeful lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: relic flute's power in silence subverts sound-weaving trope, growing inevitably from discordant break to chest hum; risk-taking in quiet CR heightens stakes without gimmick. Transformation via failure-harvest angle feels organic and memorable.</comment>
