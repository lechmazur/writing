<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and motivation rooted in grandmother's promise culminate in earned tears at the portrait reveal, with micro-choices like painting the tear showing contradictory tenderness; minor diagnostic label ("analytically intuitive") slightly detaches interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as artistic acts build density to CR closure in the tear-painting beat where the face reforms, reweighting vandalism as rescue with emotional cost; orientation anchored early, no shards exceed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Archive walls "shiver" and charred canvas constrain choices, charging final healing image; sensory details (soot smudge, obsidian ink) filter through Mara's artistic bias, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue promise via art-trail) tightens accumulatively through room-by-room deepening, foreclosing destructive label with tears and redefinition at portrait climax; cost felt but lacks sharper trade-off in peak choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of preservation as "gardening" emerges organically from symbols and final face reveal, offering resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; complexity in volcanic tenderness avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in artistic noticing (brushstrokes, symbols) stable in single POV; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels from room to room without loops or scaffolds; final tear image clean and vivid, no overwriting in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist-as-gardener transforms vandalism trope through specific ink rituals and symbol trail; risk in reframing destruction as tenderness feels organic and inevitable.</comment>
