<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Jorin's arc from fidgeting fear to bright-eyed acceptance feels earned through micro-choices like following vanishing paths; Lira's mentorship crucible forces his growth with consistent traits. Minor archetypal simplicity in wise elder/young apprentice without deeper flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: journey shards build pattern of lessons and stamps toward CR closure at clearing where "courage is out there... we just helped them remember," with cost of leaving punch and endless vigil. Orientation anchored early at dock; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ridgeway's shifting paths (meadow to bridge) constrain choices, forcing shadow-watching; sensory specifics like salt/iron hum and crunching gravel charge final low-sky clearing. Recurrent punch as micro-setting anchors and evolves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find courage post-leash) deepens accumulatively via traveler encounters narrowing to realization; agency in stamping/traversing forecloses direct-path illusion with ongoing duty cost. One tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of shared courage emerges organically from stamps and travelers, resonating in final image of punch on stone; Lira's "river" line borders echo but avoids moralizing, lingering via endless vigil ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature (twilight bias, riddle-truth filter) with rhythmic lyricism modulating tension; dialogue distinct—Lira's lullaby cadence vs. Jorin's direct questions—advances goals/subtext naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors (spider silk, constellations); minor density slip in descriptive stacks like "honey and regret" but no loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ridgeway's alive, twisting magic transforms mentor-quest trope via stamp-as-compass and shared-courage reweighting; fresh synthesis of vigil duty and indirect paths feels inevitable in punch's abandonment.</comment>
