<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation intensifies convincingly through embodied cues like chest tightening and personal memory at the mural climax; micro-choices like tracing scars reveal values under pressure. Interiority particular via hyper-detailed visions post-ink. Minor reflection summary slightly abstracts peak emotional layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from clues to mural unfastening; CR closure via fragment's weight reconfigures translation premise with conceptual cost of mended histories legible in final image. Orientation anchored early in market ascent. One tightening via ink sharpens stakes without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mural and vial constrain mural choice and charge fragment reprise; selective sensory details (rust-salt ink, pulsing shard) mirror internal fracture. Atmosphere tensions intuition needs. No white-room; lived-in via tactile handling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unfasten anchor) tightens via ink vision and personal memory alignment, narrowing to intuition-only path with agency in hand-press. Accumulative escalation reweights via deepening details; cost felt in memory confrontation. Minor abstractness in weaver's stakes declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of honoring overlooked emerges organically via particulars like drowned world's memory; final lighthouse pulse offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting threads without moralizing. Subtext in elusively tangible shard. No tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in rune-parsing and dust-language noticing; voice modulates poetically under ink pressure. Dialogue subtextual (weaver's "fracture" cues task). Clean free indirect at memory bridge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful in market opening, controlled at unfastening peak. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear in clue-chaining. Minor figurative density pre-ink but pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical intuition and personal memory transforms fantasy tropes; risk in elusively tangible physics heightens closure stakes. Inevitable hindsight via ink-mural-thread progression. No derivative hedging.</comment>
