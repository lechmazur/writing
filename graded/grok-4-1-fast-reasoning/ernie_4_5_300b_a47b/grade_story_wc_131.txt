<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like pressing the reel to her ear amid growing static, reveal a hierarchy of values shifting from isolation to guardianship. Methodical traits constrain actions authentically, earning the closure shift. Minor label ("kindly nature emerged") slightly abstracts without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds tightly: reel fragment triggers sense memory, propelling crawl to grille, decoder discovery, and message reveal as Charged Poise RR with identity cost legible in "she felt seen." Orientation anchors in first paragraph. One tightening at basement machine suffices; no slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains via slick pipe chases and pried grille, charging choices; sapphire hush recurs to frame final image. Sensory selection (metallic scent, mildew) reflects POV urgency. Micro-setting (flashlight beam) integrates purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trace reel to visibility) tightens causally via intensifying sense memory to machine discovery, narrowing isolation options. Agency in prying grille risks exposure; cost felt in new messenger role foreclosing invisibility. Escalation coherent under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of invisibility-to-guardianship emerges organically from tape message and caching act, with final image resonating non-literally. Sapphire hush reweights hush as poised readiness. No moralizing; ambiguity in "they'll never see us" lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in tactile details (cool dirt, fogging metal) biased to hidden spaces. Lyrical diction modulates rhythmically with intensity, consistent under stress. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies purposefully, sentence variety supports beats. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("staining the air") doesn't obscure causality. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crawl-dweller discovering post-outage lifeline transforms tropes via sense memory causal drive. Risky library underbelly choreography feels inevitable; final reconfiguration bold without gimmick.</comment>
