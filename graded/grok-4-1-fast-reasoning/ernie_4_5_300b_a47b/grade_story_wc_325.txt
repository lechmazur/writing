<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied concretely as "heart that raced" and "shallow gasps," driving contradictory impulses against obsession; micro-choices like prying door and slapping fleck reveal values under pressure. Final tears and emergence earn change with felt emotional cost. Minor reflection on brother anchors present panic without flattening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via descent→discovery→tide force→signal reveal; orientation anchored early ("forgotten research facility... half-swallowed by the sea"). Closure as CR lands on-page in "blip—a signature... her brother’s last signal," with legible cost in "tears blurred... water reached her waist" and facility groan.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory vivid and selective ("rust and salt... moss-slicked concrete... dried seaweed"); facility constrains choices via flooding "water began seeping... reached her waist," charging final "emerged into the crashing hush." POV bias narrows to claustrophobic immediacies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (track brother's invisible trace) signaled early, tightens causally via tide "lurch shook... water to ankles"; agency in slapping fleck forecloses escape delay with physical cost. Escalation narrows options without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of invisible etched visible emerges organically via gold signal and "cables... memorials," reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like brother's bubble→blip; ambiguity in proof's emotional sufficiency lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("taste of rust and salt... walls seemed to press in"); diction/rhythm modulate stress, compressing at peak "slapped the gold fleck... machines whirred." No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory/action ("pried open the door, revealing..."); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in "star trapped in amber" simile, but purposeful without muddling climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phase-transition gold tracking electromagnetic memorials transforms lost-at-sea trope; "undersea cables transmit presence" inflects sci-fi organically with personal loss. Risk in quiet CR payoff heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
