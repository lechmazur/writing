<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation to encode needs via ghost, rooted in family losses, culminates in self-urging mirror symbol; interiority concrete in symbols but lacks embodied contradiction, e.g., forgiveness bolt "trembled" hints but no simultaneous impulses acting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of messages building to plate-warming CR ("its metal warm now, as if the ghost had touched it"); cost legible in "messages...would fade" vs. ghost memory; orientation anchored early in courtyard/mist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plate as micro-setting constrains drawing ("steady his hand") and charges final image ("hummed softly"); mist/storm sensory purposeful, mirroring internal states via "hummed...singing through the walls."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of articulating needs tightens texturally through successive encodings and storm pressure ("fingers moving faster"); agency in persisting draw despite rain, cost felt in fading art vs. ghost bridge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken endurance emerges via symbols (question-heart, softened lightning); final CR reweights silence risk non-literally ("unspoken needs would find their way home") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases to spectral/code ("ghost in code"); rhythmic diction ("tinkersong wonder") modulates with storm intensity, no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "charcoal...trails like smoke" advances action/atmosphere); minor paraphrase in repeated "between lightning and thunder" dings propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Ghost in code" via graffiti symbols transforms folklore into fresh encoding synthesis; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in plate's hum/ghost smile hindsight.</comment>
