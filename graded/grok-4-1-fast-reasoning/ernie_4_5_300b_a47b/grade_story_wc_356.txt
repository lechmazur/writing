<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via olfactory sensitivity and contradictory impulses (rushing soil adjustments vs. dream-prompted stillness), earning final tempering of ambition; journal doodles reveal internal hierarchy of values. Minor slip in occasional diagnostic phrasing like "undercurrent of wisdom" feels slightly unearned mid-process.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dormancy-doubts accumulate to method shift and bloom as Resonant Reconfiguration (village harmony, personal wisdom) with felt cost in foreclosed rushing path; orientation anchored early in treetop village and seed gift. Dream whisper "Wisdom grows in the hush" pivots causality cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy via POV's nose (seed's "metallic tang," promising musk) constrains choices like soil acidity; treetop elements (vines, lanterns, pinecones) charge final garden bloom image. Subtle mirroring of internal hush in "wildflower hush" integrates without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seed growth for serenity) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via dormancy reversal and agency-driven hush adoption, foreclosing impatience with visible cost in jagged doodles; elders' warning adds external pressure. Bloom crystallizes stance under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of patience uncovering wisdom emerges organically from seed's hush needs and Lira's arc, resonating in final bloom image reweighting ambition; no moralizing, ambiguity in "chaos and serenity as kin" lingers. Avoids platitudes through concrete scents and doodles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (olfactory biases shape all noticing); rhythmic prose modulates from ambitious energy to hushed cadence, as in "breeze’s caress." Elders' dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm matching accumulative hush; varied syntax propels to bloom. Minor metaphor density in opening ("vines draped like ancient tapestries") risks slight overwriting but pattern-taught and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of olfactory herbalism, corpse flower, and treetop hush transforms growth trope; "tide’s thought" and doodling custom offer non-obvious ingenuity tying to wisdom payoff.</comment>
