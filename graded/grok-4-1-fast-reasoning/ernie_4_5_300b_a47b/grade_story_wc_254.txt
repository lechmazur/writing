<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in aesthetic drive, compelling choices like speaking and stepping onto the lake; embodied emotions via "tremor... in her veins." Lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during climax step, tilting toward epiphanic certainty without strong internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from speaking to boundary dissolution and CR closure in final step onto water-held surface; orientation anchored immediately in atrium/lake. Conceptual cost legible in "colonnade... a threshold" reconfiguration, no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (quartz "veins singing," ice "parting... as if breathing") filter through poet's bias, mirroring internal states and constraining climax via rippling stone/lake. Recurring quartz and lake charge final image without static repetition or white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dissolve boundaries post-ban) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via intensifying hum/ripples to tightening at lake step; agency in paraphrasing forecloses observer role with felt risk of fall. One decisive deepening suffices, cost conceptual in reshaped world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of sacred/profane blur emerges organically from paraphrasing events and motifs like cracking ice; final image offers resonant CR repricing of post-ban world without moralizing. Complexity lingers in unnameable freedom, tied to protagonist's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature in poetic impressions ("shadow might dance if given voice"); rhythmic modulation builds intensity without head-hopping or register drift. Voice coheres as poet's biased noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in sensory rhythm, but paraphrase/synonym loops ("boundaries began to dissolve... line between stone and air blurred") and repetitive "tremor/paraphrase" stems create mild scaffold in mid-build, dulling peak without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh lyric fantasy synthesis of poet-shaping world via quartz/lake, transforming isolation trope through specific post-ban dissolution; risk in surreal step heightens stakes organically, no derivative templates.</comment>
