<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion in "lotus-hearted ache" coils grief/tenderness, driving micro-choices like tracing doodles; final alchemy realization earned via coral/cast mirrors. Minor diagnostic phrasing in coined terms slightly undercuts raw contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflections/images builds to CR closure in coral at table ("This grew from ruin. So can we."), with conceptual cost in sharp ridges reweighting peace premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring coral fragment constrains palm and charges final negotiating image; mist sensory hierarchy narrows to intimacies, mirroring internal fraying/regrowth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unknot anxieties) signaled early, textural deepening via decrypting tightens to coral-table agency; cost legible in general's "It’s… sharp" forcing trade-off acknowledgment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of grafting ruins emerges via cast/coral particulars, final image non-literally answers without moralizing; resonance from ache softening as seed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (translator's paradox gaze) with rhythmic modulation; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Sharp things can carve new paths").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image, rhythm varies; figurative density ("ghost’s fingers") overwrites slightly in opening but patterns payoff at closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh alchemy-of-translation via coral/cast transforms peace-talk trope; non-obvious "sharp" general response risks bold synthesis inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
