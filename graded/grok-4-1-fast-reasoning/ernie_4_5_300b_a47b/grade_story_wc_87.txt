<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in regrets vs. forward motion, embodied in compass grip and lighthouse whisper; final renunciation of hiding earned via prior flickers and poles. Minor slip in diagnostic "measuring regret" phrasing at realization beat slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: navigational images densify to CR closure in compass left on railing, cost legible in "I’m done hiding" echo dissolving into air. Continuous scene with kayak shard transition; orientation anchored by launch/dawn in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Compass and poles recur to constrain choices (flickering navigation) and charge final beach image; selective sensory (salt air biting, tide mercury) mirrors internal unrest without catalog. Lighthouse spiral creaks confessionally, integrating into ascent action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend regrets via navigation) tightens accumulatively through pole shadows shifting and needle nowhere, narrowing to lighthouse endurance; agency in leaving compass forecloses hiding with felt cost in non-look-back paddle. Escalation coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of regrets as indifferent tide emerges via particulars (scratched compass, drifting pleas); final surge forward reconfigures "align heart and action" non-literally without moralizing. Closing line's alive-reminder carries oblique cost, resisting tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with navigational perceptual bias (stars/maps, poles as bones); rhythmic modulation peaks in short creak-confession sentences at stairs, lyric compression taught early pays off in charged poise image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., needle tremor mirrors pulse advances stakes/emotion); rhythm varies for propulsion, openings diverse. Figurative density borders overwrite in reflective paddling ("metronome," "merrily melancholic" reprise), minor muddle without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh navigational regrets synthesis (compass measures choices, poles tame chaos) transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens closure stakes via irreplaceable lighthouse horizon-blur.</comment>
