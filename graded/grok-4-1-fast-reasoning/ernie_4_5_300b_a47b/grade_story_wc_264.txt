<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's dreamlessness creates embodied ache ("chest ached") that motivates his pivotal choice to become "occasionally everywhere," earning his transformation with visible cost of prior absence. Woman's pressure reveals his blind spot effectively. Minor abstraction in impulses prevents peak score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density builds from dimming sand to erupting light, culminating in on-page RR (Kael dreams; "for the first time") with legible cost of isolation reconfigured. Orientation anchored early in dune/archive. Single surreal scene coherent, clock incites cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent sand and emotion-towers constrain choices (sand dims/holds breath on clock touch; erupts at climax) and charge final image of sparks growing on dune. Sensory selection (burnt honey, static) reflects dream-watch bias. Purposeful integration elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate fading sparks) signaled early, escalates via clock discovery and woman's guidance to agency-driven deepening ("standing in three places at once"), narrowing options under Accumulative lens. Cost felt in transformation; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of imagination's rebirth emerges organically from particulars (fading dreams to star-tangled forests), final image resonantly reweights absence with non-literal growth of sparks. No moralizing; ambiguity in woman's nature lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature (e.g., "fractured lullaby of heat and light") biases toward dream fragments; dialogue subtextual ("How fitting") advances stakes. Stable third-limited POV; rhythm modulates to charged compression at "he was standing in three places at once."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but figurative density in climax ("roaring white," "fountain of light") borders overwriting without obscuring closure. Zero loops; precise diction like "wave function" serves voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum-dream surrealism (wave functions, divergent archive) transforms tropes organically, with risk-taking in "occasionally everywhere" heightening stakes toward inevitable dream-closure. No derivatives; singular vision coherent.</comment>
