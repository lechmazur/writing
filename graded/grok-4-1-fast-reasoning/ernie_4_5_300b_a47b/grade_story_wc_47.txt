<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions and micro-choices like unclapsing the pendant reveal contradictory impulses under grief's pressure; final change earned via dialogue buildup. Minor tidiness in epiphany ("healing wasn’t about erasing") edges from 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in sapling planting and hand squeeze; cost legible in "lighten[ing]" pendant weight and vulnerability admission. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moss garden constrains choices (e.g., servers as "anchors," drip pattern mapped into art) and charges final image (sapling at center, mosslight on pendant). Sensory details purposeful, filtered through Lila's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief-to-healing) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via pendant reveal and moss graft; agency in "Stay" request forecloses isolation with relational cost. Tightening sufficient but lacks sharper trade-off in pivotal exchange.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grafting wounds emerges organically from particulars (obsidian sliver, moss sprig); final image ("pendant swung... threaded with orchid roots") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting past without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable Lila POV with perceptual signature (pattern-tracing, glow-noticing); dialogue natural/subtextual ("Grafting requires vulnerability"). Rhythmic control modulates hush to laughter effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; metaphors consistent (honey/syrup hush) without muddle in peak (pendant mossing). Minor paraphrase in reflection beats ("grow deliberate," "letting it breathe") dings propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data center as grief-garden transforms tropes; drip pattern and orchid grafting feel inevitable. Quiet risk in lyric healing pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
