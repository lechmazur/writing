<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Jorin's meekness and quiet determination shine in embodied endurance during the shard strikes, where he mutters "Resilience isn’t born from safety" without flinching, earning the final orb grasp; internal conflict emerges subtly through neighbor's warning versus resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: silk arrival → mine entry → Lira confrontation → shard trial → orb DC with endured pain as cost; orientation anchors early via forge under arches; no lens ambiguity, closure legible in emergence to blooming orchards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating arches' shadows and mine's crystalline walls constrain path choices and mirror decay, charging final steady arches; sensory details like damp earth and cold drafts integrate via goal-directed descent, avoiding white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (planet's awakening) tightens via shard barrage forcing endurance trade-off, with blood and pain as visible cost; agency in choosing center tunnel and "Show me" narrows options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resilience theme emerges organically from silk absorbing strikes and orb fusion, reweighting decay in final blooming image; muttered line on resilience borders direct statement but ties to prior with ambiguity in defiance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (measured steps under shadows); sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven, Lira's lines advancing stakes; rhythmic prose modulates from setup calm to cavern intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density in cavern (glow intensifies, shards fuse); minor metaphor density ("skeletal hand," "veins") in opener but purposeful without muddle at closure orb.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meek smith bartering silk for planetary core trial transforms quest trope via shard pain as literal resilience; risk in quiet defiance payoff feels inevitable from setup particulars.</comment>
