<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to reawaken beauty roots in consistent traits like half-mad hypothesizing, intensifying to compel assembly and endurance through fear of shattering the egg; embodied tears and trembling at the crack reveal contradictory hope/fear acting simultaneously. Final surge and palace bloom earn a credible reconfiguration with felt cost of prior solitude. Elder Thalos applies brief pressure without diluting Corvin's arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hypothesizing, contraption assembly, and keening sound builds to on-page RR closure as orb hatches ("with a final, shattering pop") and palace blooms, reconfiguring mechanical world with legible emotional cost in Corvin's tears and years implied. Single scene anchors who/where/when by para 2; no orientation debt. One tightening via sound/cracking suffices for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration—boots clicking marble, oil/regret air, stalactites humming—mirrors Corvin's fractured state and constrains assembly in atrium; palace evolves causally from grinding gears to blooming vines at orb flare, charging final image. POV bias filters details through his reverie (e.g., "stolen starlight"). Micro-setting (egg nest, contraption) guides choices without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hatch egg to reawaken beauty vs. Mechanists' clockwork) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via keening/crack to orb hatching, forcing Corvin's stance crystallization with agency in precise movements and endurance; visible cost in shaking hands/tears charges final palace shift. One deepening reversal narrows options under lens; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of nurture over forging emerges organically from egg's "flawed genesis" pulsing to orb's imperfect life sparking organic bloom, reweighting mechanical decay in final image ("closes hand around orb...assemble the future") without moralizing. Subtext in palace "sigh" and "remember" invites ambiguity on rebuilding's cost. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in reverie-tinged diction (e.g., "quaking reverie"); syntax/rhythm modulate from paced hypothesizing to crescendo at crack. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("Not me...Together"), distinct voices; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density integrates setting/action (e.g., "lens to focus moonlight"); minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("frozen tear," "dying star") slightly muddles early beats but spares closure. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; strong verbs propel to hatching pop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of suspended palace as organic relic in mechanical abyss, with egg-orb transforming tropes of creation myth; risk in quaking reverie tone heightens stakes via vulnerability, inevitable in hindsight from hypothesizing buildup. No derivative echoes; bold world logic commits fully.</comment>
