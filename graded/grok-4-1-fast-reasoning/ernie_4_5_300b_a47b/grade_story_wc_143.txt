<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied details like trembling gloves and fogged visor reveal Lira's melancholy resolve; motivation rooted in grandfather's legacy drives micro-choices like vial placement. Minor flaw: reflective grandfather stories verge on summary without enough on-page tilt to present stakes, but don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via ticking chronometer and building hush; mosaic shards (summit, base, archive, Earth) taught by reflective pattern with legible time transitions. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in archivist's smile and Lira's unknowing dawn gaze, reweighting indifference with conceptual endurance cost; one tightening via drones chime narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonlit summit micro-setting constrains via chronometer urgency and dust edges, charging vial placement and gas image; sensory hierarchy (visual glows, suit chill) filtered through inspector's priorities. Final crater/gas/Earth photo integrates environment to mirror fleeting presence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (photograph lasting proof before drones) signaled early, tightens texturally via dawn tick and chimes forcing activation; agency in laser trigger forecloses delay with felt obsolescence cost. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, though drones arrive post-climax without complicating agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of human care outlasting cosmic indifference emerges organically from sand dissolution and shadow in photo; final shards reweight premise via archivist realization without moralizing. Resonant CR offers non-literal answer: truths persist sans audience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (curiosity in crater edges, Earth whispers); rhythmic modulation builds hush to dawn burst. No dialogue; purposeful compression in shards pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in ticking beats; varied rhythm avoids monotony, metaphors cohere (hourglass sand as timed truth). Minor scaffold in "outlasted" recurrences purposeful for motif, not loop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lunar obsolescence via chemical relic and archival echo transforms Space Age trope; risk in mosaic shards heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
