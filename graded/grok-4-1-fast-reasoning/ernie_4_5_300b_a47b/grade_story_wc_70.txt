<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clara's involuntary truthfulness creates contradictory impulses, constraining her hesitation before the public reveal and earning her final choice with social pariah cost; embodied in "her candor felt like a burden" and sharp retort to Voss. Voss applies targeted pressure as secretive engineer. Minor unearned quick pivot from routine to "weaponize" candor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: drone failure therefore box discovery therefore riddle reveal therefore public action restores power as Conceptual Repricing with Clara's routine-foreclosing cost. Orientation anchored early via booth/tower/blackout. Two clean shards transition legibly; closure image of buzzing drones reconfigures stakes on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tower's glowing cables and scattered drones constrain discovery and charge final buzzing reprise; sensory hum/gravel/crunch filters through Clara's keeper bias. Atmosphere tensions mundane routine with restless energy, mirroring internal shift. "Nectar dusk" golden light evolves causally to closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reignite wonder to end blackout) tightens causally via box/riddle knowledge change, narrowing options to public candor with pariah cost legible in her hesitation. Agency in opening box and speaking forecloses routine path. Voss revelation forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of wonder vs. routine emerges organically via drones pollinating curiosity, riddle answer, and Clara's speech; final "spark—not of electricity, but of something older" offers non-literal resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Voss/Clara lines carry mild thematic echo (−0.3), but subtext in box pulse and child reaction deepens.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in Clara's poetic noticing ("breath fogging the glass," "syrupy" dusk); dialogue natural/subtextual—Voss's cryptic warning pursues secrecy goal. Rhythmic modulation builds to earnest speech; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with lines doubling action/atmosphere (e.g., "boots crunching gravel" advances setting/urgency); varied rhythm accelerates to reveal, breathes in reflection. Minor overwriting in "light turned golden and syrupy, as if dipped in honey" (−0.3), but no loops or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi tower with wonder-fueled mechanics transforms mundane toll keeper into catalyst; drones pollinating doubt/curiosity feels inevitable from early hives mention. Risky conceptual premise commits fully without retreat, heightening stakes via riddle turn.</comment>
