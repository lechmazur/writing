<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in embodied hesitation before showing Gus the cloth, earning the final purpose shift; "confidently uncertain" embodies well in fact-insulated doubts without therapy-speak overload.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as cloth density builds to Google reveal ("a stylized phoenix") and call, delivering CR closure with emotional cost in "hollow space where purpose used to live" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Trailer's "mildew and regret" plus posters constrain emotional choices, mirroring internal state; quarry blasts evolve to fade during call, charging final talisman image without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose post-loss) tightens via Gus dismissal forcing deeper pursuit, with agency in call narrowing options under accumulative lens; cost legible in shaking hands at Echo Valley link.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"After the applause, what’s left?" emerges organically via cloth's failure-relic status, reweighting in non-literal phone payoff without moralizing; ambiguity in brief fame lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases toward music relics ("roar of crowds"); Gus dialogue subtextually wounds ("Looks like a dish towel"), natural and goal-pursuing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; minor "insulating himself" paraphrase loop in reflections dulls one beat but misses peak call.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie relic igniting appraiser's purpose transforms failure trope; phone call to bassist risks bold reconnection without gimmick.</comment>
