<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in pursuit of understanding vibrant houses, embodied in deliberate ritual actions; interiority particular through "creeping normality noticer" lens. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, with competent execution missing deeper struggle or blind-spot mistakes before realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of displaced objects builds to hush-thickening and glow; orientation anchored early in bay at night. Conceptual Repricing closure lands in "houses...pulsed with a faint, golden light," reweighting hush as potential with felt conceptual cost of sanctification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details selective and POV-biased: orris scent of "forgotten gardens," water lapping boots; bay amplifies hush, constraining ritual choice. Shore houses as recurring micro-setting charge final image of twitching curtains and flickering lights, constraining and elevating closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to test theory via orris/ritual signaled early, tightens texturally as air "thickens" and objects tremble, narrowing to sanctification. Agency in arranging forces reconfiguration; cost legible in racing heart and foreclosed mundane perception of houses.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hush as potential emerges organically from displaced anchors and orris fixation; final shore walk offers resonant non-literal answer in alive houses "listening, waiting." Avoids moralizing, with ambiguity in vibrant vs. haunted lingering purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in subtle noticings like "porch swing creaked in a rhythm that didn’t match the wind." Voice texture poetic yet controlled: rhythmic modulation in hush-fall to glow-ripple without opacity or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with lines like "inhaling its faint, earthy scent...forgotten gardens" advancing character and atmosphere; rhythm varies naturally. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("whisper," "hush," "silence") during ritual but coherent and pattern-taught without muddling closure glow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of noticing subtleties, perfumery fixation, and displaced anchors transforming haunted-house trope into vibrant potential. Risky hushed-lyric tone heightens stakes in ritual payoff, inevitable in hindsight via orris "fixing" silence.</comment>
