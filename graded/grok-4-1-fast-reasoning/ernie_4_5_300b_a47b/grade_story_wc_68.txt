<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation roots deeply in trait-consistent obsession, with embodied agony in bleeding hands and micro-choices like aligning cog and needle revealing value hierarchy. Internal conflict layers contradictory impulses (rebellion vs. pragmatism) acting in scene via dialogue and digging. Mara's pressure forces relational crucible, culminating in earned endurance; minor diagnostic phrasing like "abrasive calm" slightly dilutes embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through layers of sediment, finds, and dialogue to Charged Poise closure: cog-needle astrolabe and Mara's hesitation reconfigure stakes, with bleeding hands as felt cost in final lines. Orientation anchors immediately (sewer cavern, post-plague Veyra). Single continuous scene with one tightening (assembly) holds lens without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory specificity (stench as "second skin," algae-choked water) filters through Elias's priorities, constraining choices like daily scavenging and sediment digging. Sediment layers as micro-setting evolve causally, mirroring internal states and charging final image. Spatial choreography clear in ruins-to-sewer flow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve methods vs. sell scrap) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Mara's challenges and assembly reversal narrowing options to endurance. Agency in digging despite pain shows trade-off; bleeding hands make cost visible under lens. Moral calculus (past vs. new order) sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of competing narratives emerges organically from Elias-Mara clash and layered finds, reweighted in final heartbeat sound without moralizing. Subtext in Mara's hesitation invites ambiguity; cog reprise shifts meaning. Minor overtness in "competing narratives clashed" line tempers resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature (philosophical lens on relics) and distinct voices: Elias's silk-razor idiom vs. Mara's gravel laugh. Dialogue advances goals with subtext (pragmatism vs. faith). Rhythm modulates under pressure, clean free indirect.</comment>
<question>7</grade><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., cog "hummed like a trapped heartbeat" advances character and atmosphere); varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor paraphrase loops in sediment descriptions (−0.3); no closure artifacts, strong propulsion to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sunken philosopher with cog-as-dialogue synthesizes post-plague decay and navigation rebellion freshly; sedimentary narratives transform trope organically. Risk in "time isn’t linear" payoff feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
