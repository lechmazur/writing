<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Thaddeus's motivation to distill essence is consistent and embodied through sensory details like thumbing the needle groove, but lacks contradictory impulses or flawed micro-choices under pressure; serenity dominates without internal conflict acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of observations building to Charged Poise RR closure ("carry his own layer forward"), cost felt in ongoing weaving duty; orientation anchored early ("gloom-hill coachman" at river); no tightening turn narrows options beyond patient endurance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fog and river constrain perception ("muffled sound, water lapped"), selectively mirroring internal clarity; recurring needle as micro-setting charges final handling; vivid sensory hierarchy via POV bias elevates, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distilling essence) signaled but static, no meaningful reversal or deepening narrows options under Accumulative lens; waiting hours mentioned but uncohering pressure, serenity deflates tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of layered attentiveness emerges organically from needle/river images, final dock pause reweights palimpsest without moralizing; subtext in silent ritual invites ambiguity on clarity's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature ("truth hid in gaps between stitches"); rhythmic modulation fits serene tone, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Verbatim loops ("distill complexity into essence" x3, "palimpsest promise" x3) create paraphrase churn obscuring propulsion; mixed metaphors ("knife through linen," "second skin") cohere but overwrite in reflective beats; density varies but artifacts dull mid-section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of yarn needle as untangler with fog-ritual transforms mundane ferry into resonant essence-distillation; risk in lyric Accumulative risks stasis but heightens thematic poise.</comment>
