<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken ship's brine/decay and pristine shelves constrain wading/entry choices; squelching boots and domed ceiling charge final image, with sensory hierarchy (lantern glow piercing hush) mirroring internal gold realization.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sunken library's synesthetic vows transform ghost-chase trope via key's relic logic; fresh premise synthesis inevitable in gold realization, risking poetic hush without gimmick.</comment>
