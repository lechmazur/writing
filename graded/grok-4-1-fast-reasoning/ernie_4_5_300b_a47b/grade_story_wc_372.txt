<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Solid motivation rooted in meticulous traits drives precise micro-choices like lens adjustment and frequency sampling; embodied frustration peaks at fist slam, revealing internal tension between hurry and precision. Final endurance earned as illusions steady, with exhaustion cost felt. Minor lack of deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via sequential samplings toward Charged Poise closure (illusions brighten post-reconstruction, cost in dimming/exhaustion legible at "light dimmed... slammed her fist"). Orientation anchored early (library, Elara, fading magic). One tightening via frustration-to-recommitment sufficient; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (frosted panes, howling wind, humming air) integrate via goal-action, with fading illusions constraining urgency and dawn light charging final image. POV-filtered (professional focus on light spectra); spatial coherence clear. Environment subtly mirrors internal strain without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstruct vows to save library) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via partial successes/frustrations to peak at slam and recapture; agency in sampling forecloses failure path with exhaustion cost. One deepening (vow reformation) narrows options legibly. Coheres under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of meaning from oblivion emerges organically via vow reconstruction and illusion revival, reweighted in dawn-brightened final image without moralizing. Subtext in precision vs. entropy tension; earned resonance from particulars. Avoids tidy binary, lingers with ongoing fade ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (light frequencies, rune shimmers); rhythmic prose modulates from calm precision to brisk urgency. No dialogue; compression purposeful, elision absent. Voice texture character-specific, no head-hopping or leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short frustrated bursts vs. flowing descriptions); metaphors coherent (e.g., "colors bleaching like old ink"). Minor template cadence in repeated samplings ("sampled the blue... green") dings slightly, but no loops obscure closure. Propulsion clear, no artifacts in peak fist-slam beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spectral science-magic in vow decoding transforms library trope via frequency sampling; premise angle (light oaths powering illusions) organic. Risk in poetic compression pays off in charged closure; no derivative echoes.</comment>
