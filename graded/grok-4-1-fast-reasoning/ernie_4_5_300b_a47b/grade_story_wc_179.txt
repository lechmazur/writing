<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Scheming pacifist traits motivate ritual choices effectively, but visitors read as stock types (e.g., "man bitter over lost love") reducing particularity; Lirael's internal tug at finite vial earns her endurance with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with visitor pattern building density to Charged Poise closure ("reality snapped back... grace had shifted"); on-page cost legible in last drop and snap; orientation anchored early in sanctuary/music box.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary with velvet walls mirrors internal noise, constraining emotional release ritual; recurring pin as micro-setting charges final image in Kael's palm, selective sensory focus on silence/glow purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of teaching release escalates accumulatively via visitor sequence tightening to Kael's doubt/climax; agency in pouring drops forecloses vial limit with felt cost, coherent pressure narrows to fragile hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of resentment release emerges via pin's scarred reformations, but slips into direct statement ("grace isn’t perfect. It’s messy") in Kael beat; final image offers non-literal resonance without full moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person Lirael POV with perceptual bias toward grace/shifts; dialogue natural/subtextual (Elara's "How?", Kael's "trick"); rhythmic modulation supports silence-to-hum cadence, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Minor repetition in pin glow/reform phrasing across visitors creates paraphrase loop; metaphors coherent (time like taffy) but elevated diction occasionally drifts in explanations; propulsion strong to closure snap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cellular memory ritual on heirloom pin transforms pacifist teaching trope; risk in magical reality shifts pays off in charged ending without gimmickry.</comment>
