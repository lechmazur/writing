<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's contradictory skeptic/imaginative impulses act in scene, recoiling at vision but prying drain regardless, earning final smile amid doubt with scraped-finger cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as breadcrumb density builds to marble clink and light eruption, delivering Charged Poise closure with legible cost in raw fingers and empty box.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fountains constrain choices (mosaic, basin, drain) and charge closure (roaring waters mirror internal release), with sensory details like crunching gravel and dust motes POV-filtered through goal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Breadcrumb quest escalates accumulatively via hum intensification and vision-forced drain pry, narrowing options with agency-driven cost in trembling hands and scraped skin charging final image.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Defiance via realistic imagination reweights premise in final wet-cobblestone proof, emerging organically from particulars without moralizing, inviting ambiguity in persisting doubt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (dissecting shadows, fractured starlight eyes); rhythm modulates pressure, prose as skeptic-imaginative mind without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric figurative layering (e.g., "wind through a forgotten valley") propels accumulatively; minor hum-repetition paraphrase nudges down but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms quest trope via breadcrumb mechanics in memory-trapping fountains, fresh synthesis of skeptic-prophet arc yielding inevitable cosmic patience payoff.</comment>
