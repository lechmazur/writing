<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to discover intentions is clear and consistent, driving the decoding, but lacks contradictory impulses or embodied internal conflict under pressure; micro-choices like tracing threads reveal values mildly. No deep flaws complicate the process. Tempering of blithe nature at "her blithe nature tempered by the weight" feels earned but thin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via thread discoveries (stars, knight, name, date, phrase) tightening to CR closure where she reburies with felt conceptual cost of carrying knowledge. Orientation anchored early in silo. Single scene coherent; final rolling/reburying reconfigures options legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: cobalt walls pulse, frayed threads touched gently, oculus aligns stars constraining decoding. Atmosphere mirrors internal rhythm, evolving with discoveries. Silo slab as micro-setting enables spreading; charges final reburial image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode tapestry's secrets) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through revelations narrowing to "The silence between moves" realization; agency in tracing/untangling forecloses disturbance of dead with cost in tempered blitheness. One deepening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of intentions echoing through time emerges organically from tapestry particulars, not statement; final stars shimmering reweights dead's silence without moralizing. Resonance from conflicting blithe tending vs. heavy knowledge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: gardener's tactile focus on soil/threads/earth. Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, compression purposeful in discoveries; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("frayed threads," "velveteen gloom") building texture, but minor overwriting in metaphors like "skeletal finger" risks muddle during peak decoding. Rhythm varies, propulsion strong to closure. No loops dulling image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cemetery tending, chess-time motifs, and tapestry as intention-map transforms death tropes ingeniously; reburial turn inevitable from particulars, risking poetic conceit paid off in CR.</comment>
