<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Compassionate recluse traits shine in sensing members' unspoken stories early, rooting motivation in grief; contradictory hide/seek impulses act in approaching the table. Final staying choice earned via mounting revelations. Minor slip: recluse avoidance feels under-tested against crowd pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from invitation to letters; orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure as RR (Charged Poise) lands cleanly in final shelf image with felt grief cost ("admit you’re lost"). Map-to-key progression tightens without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like warped reflection in glassy book surface mirror internal states purposefully. Mirrors constrain by forcing alternate-self confrontation, charging tears moment; Third Shelf evolves as payoff anchor. No generic placeholders; all tactile and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant grief-reconciliation stake signaled early, tightens accumulatively via map/mirrors/letters discoveries narrowing hide-to-reveal options. Agency in placing invitation and inserting key forecloses retreat with emotional cost (tears). Coherent pressure to final stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hiding as selective revelation emerges organically from letters' forgiveness notes, reweighting premise without statement. Final image ("letters cradled to her chest") offers non-literal resonant answer to grief question. Complexity in imperfection embraces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in empathetic sensing ("weight of their unspoken stories"); voice modulates rhythmically from shadowed tension to tranquil close. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("The book shows what you bring"). No head-hopping or leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; sensory propulsion integrates action (key slides open). Minor artifact: "enlarged tranquility" jars slightly as odd diction without payoff. No loops or scaffolds; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Secret society library transforms grief trope via map-invitation ingenuity and paradox-password entry. Mirrors' alternate selves offer fresh emotional calculus. Risk in quiet stasis payoff heightens personal stakes organically.</comment>
