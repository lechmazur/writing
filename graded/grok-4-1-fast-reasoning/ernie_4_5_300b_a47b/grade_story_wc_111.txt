<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prove human touch over algorithms drives consistent micro-choices like redirecting vines; marbles as ledger reveal interior resilience without stock epiphanies. Joren's arc from skepticism to adoption earned via demo. Minor telling in "wisely pragmatic" but actions embody traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from routines to Joren interaction and demo, culminating in Charged Poise RR: "maze bloomed—not in spite of its wounds, but because of them," reweighting precision vs. imperfection with conceptual cost of tech refusal. Orientation anchored early; one tightening in path stabilization suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maze as living entity constrains choices (vine blocks sensor, paths shift daily); recurring marbles/vines charge final image of blooming wounds. Sensory details (hedges absorb light, vine tension) filtered through Elara's priorities integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (human intuition > algorithms) signaled early, tightens accumulatively in Joren demo where path stabilizes after vine redirect, narrowing tech-reliance option with effort cost. Maze response adds density; no reversals needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of resilience in cracks emerges organically via marbles mapping victories and final blooming image reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in "mended deception" and Joren's stone ties actions to proof of touch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elara's perceptual signature (mazes sigh, vines curl tensely); dialogue natural/subtextual ("These are proof," "Luck is just..."). Voice modulates poetically yet controlled, distinguishing characters idiomatically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short emphatic lines in demo); high density integrates image/action. Minor paraphrase loops on marble polishing ("polish the marbles," "polished a marble") deduct lightly as purposeful motif, not obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of measurable luck, algorithmic maze, and cracked marbles as resilience ledger transforms tropes organically; risk in "gardens know gardeners" premise heightens stakes via Elara's vine/sensor deception.</comment>
