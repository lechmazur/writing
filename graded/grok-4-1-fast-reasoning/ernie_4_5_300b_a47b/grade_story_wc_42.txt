<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to harness the ephemeral drives consistent micro-choices like using the ear trumpet and soldering under escalating pressure. Interior contradiction emerges in trembling hands amid steady expertise, embodied in the climax leap. Minor abstraction in "luminous ache" slightly undercuts peak emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds tightly: clock spin prompts ear trumpet fix, quake reversal forces circuit rewire, portal realization, and synchronized leap as DC with felt fear/wonder cost. Orientation anchors immediately in observatory and tremor. Single tightening at portal discovery narrows to escape, lens consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory's gears/glass workshop and cracking dome constrain repairs and final hatch-opening, charging the wind-tugged leap image. Sensory selectivity (whine to shriek, ozone/pine) reflects repairer's ear for fragility. No orientation debt; setting evolves causally with quakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tame clock chaos) tightens via failed fix to portal thrust, forcing agency in restructure/sing with quake cost foreclosing retreat. Escalation causal, one decisive reversal at hand's restart narrows to leap. Cost legible in structural cracks and personal fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of defying entropy via ephemeral harmony emerges organically through clock-as-thrust and leaf-fall method repricing time's tyranny. Final leap reweights prior repairs without moralizing. Leaf image shifts from meditation to key without token recurrence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias toward light/sound fragility; voice lyrical yet precise, modulating rhythm in peak whine-shriek to song. No head-hopping; diction character-bound to sage observer. Murmurs feel natural/internal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (soldering amid flicker); rhythm varies with short gasps at crescendo. Minor figurative density in quake beat ("boiling milk") purposeful, no loops or scaffolds dulling propulsion. Clean syntax supports causal clarity to leap.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms clock malfunction into literal escape portal via repairer's tools/methods, fresh synthesis of astronomy/craft. Risky harmony climax heightens stakes organically. No derivative templates; portal as hand-thrust inevitable from priors.</comment>
