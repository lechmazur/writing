<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in orchestrating coincidences drives releases and detour, with embodied hush vibrations; internal conflict between fixing and true transformation emerges via man's dialogue, earning final purposeful shift. Minor weakness in epiphany summary ("she understood") slightly undercuts contradictory impulses acting simultaneously at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via bug releases and hush density to on-page Conceptual Repricing closure: shadow constellation map and warmer sand reconfigure Lira's premise with conceptual cost of abandoning habitual fixing. Single scene holds causality tightly; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Black sand, volcano hiss, and bug lights vividly constrain releases and charge final shadow map image on sand; sensory hush in bones mirrors internal shift. Selective details (charcoal grit, lava rock voice) integrate purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grasping transformation signaled early via hush-chasing; man's arrival and revelation tighten accumulatively, forcing renunciation of "fixing" with felt cost in shadow map reconfiguration. Agency in final bug release and listening crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of messy transformation vs. stitching wounds emerges organically from bug releases and prophecy reveal; final hush-swelled silence and constellation map offer non-literal resonant answer, reweighting prior "nudging" with lived ambiguity. No moralizing despite bordering insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (hush as "texture," bone vibrations); dialogue subtextual and distinct (man's rough prophecy vs. Lira's hesitant queries). Rhythm modulates from descriptive to charged closure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., bug glows casting "jagged shadows"); varied rhythm propels to closure image, no loops or artifacts despite lyrical metaphors. Minor hush repetition taught early as pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of lightning bugs as prophecy fulfillers transforms destitute philanthropist trope; accidental coincidences yield fresh CR via shadow map, with bold hush texture risking lyric density payoff at volcano-quieted closure.</comment>
