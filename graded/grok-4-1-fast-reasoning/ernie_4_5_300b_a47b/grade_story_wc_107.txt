<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong particularity in glassblower traits shown through calloused fingers shaping tasks and crack-tracing micro-choices; interior conflict embodied in whimsical narration amid abandonment fears. Final embrace of fractures earned via prior causality with visible cost in lighter steps. Minor slip in overt epiphanies like narrated philosophy slightly over-articulates without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries build density to schematic reveal as tightening, culminating in CR closure ("He’d abandon the search for perfect answers") with legible conceptual cost in reweighted premise of cracks/rebirth. Orientation anchored early in control room during thaw; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (drip echoing, frost-choked circuitry, sunbeams) constrain discovery via melting ice revealing compartment, charging final bookmark image. POV-filtered through glassblower's fracture lens; thawing evolves causally with action. Micro-setting (control panel) pivotal without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe zones) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via compartment find narrowing to imperfect embrace; agency in persistent prying yields cost in foreclosed perfection. Internal fear vs. curiosity interweaves coherently. Minor abstractness in stakes before schematic concretizes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth-through-cracks emerges organically from bookmark, glass metaphors, thawing; final image ("bookmark... aligned with a sunbeam") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting abandonment. Avoids moralizing until close echo ("Even broken things"), but particulars avoid platitude. Strong counter-reading in cherished fracture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: glassblower's tension/beauty lens on cracks/ice; rhythmic prose modulates whimsy-to-resolution without filter excess. Voice distinct in narrated tasks blending weighty lightness. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, strong verbs (prying, traced, fluttered); purposeful metaphors integrated without muddle in peak reveal. Minor paraphrase loops in abandonment musings and repetitive "narrated" stems, but no closure touch. Propulsion clean, no scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glassblower whimsy in frozen entropy, transforming abandonment trope via narrated tasks and inquiry zones; risk in weighty lightness heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable bookmark fracture inflects turns inevitably. No derivative templates.</comment>
