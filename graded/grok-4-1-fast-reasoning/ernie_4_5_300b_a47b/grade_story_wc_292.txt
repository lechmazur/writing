<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clara's nervously confident trait embodies in faltering smile and trembling hands amid discoveries, driving micro-choices like digging and roof ritual; internal conflict peaks credibly in fear-threaded commitment. Ancestor's backstory anchors tightly to nail cue without flattening pressure. Final choice to read stanza aloud forecloses evacuation path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain from nail unwrap to journal dig to roof ritual holds tightly; jet stream shift triggers director interruption then Clara's on-page DC/CR via stanza reading, nail warming, and storm response with legible risk cost. Orientation anchors in first paragraph. Single tightening suffices under causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details like salt-ozone air, gravel crunch, spongey gray sky filter through Clara's map-librarian precision, constraining digs and roof access; sickly green sky and howling wind charge climax image. Weather evolution mirrors and pressures final act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reverse exile via ancestor honor tightens via jet stream acceleration and director's evac call, forcing Clara's agency in ritual over flight; cost unmistakable in flickering lights, churning sea, and invited disaster felt on roof.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of risk-worthy truths emerges organically from ancestor parallel and ritual, reweighted in final nail-warming image without moralizing; subtext in "question the storm" resonates as non-literal answer to exile's reversibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in faded-ink precision; rhythmic control peaks in propulsive roof beat. Minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven. No elisions or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm accelerates to climax; no loops, artifacts, or overwriting—e.g., "nail grew warm in her palm" propels cleanly. Final image recharges jet stream motif without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Coffin nail reversing exile via storm ritual transforms ancestral mystery tropes through weather station logic; roof payoff feels inevitable from causal particulars, with bold supernatural risk heightening stakes.</comment>
