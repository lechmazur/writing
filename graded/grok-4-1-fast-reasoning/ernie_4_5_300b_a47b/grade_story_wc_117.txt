<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong character distinction via Elara's optimism and Mara's skepticism, with Mara's shift earned through interaction; embodied in "Mara’s skepticism melted into something softer, a cautious exuberance." Minor therapy-speak in Elara's lines slightly flattens peak emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with eclipse and curl building to Charged Poise closure; orientation anchored early at Sage Ridge; cost legible in Mara's softened stance and tucking the curl away.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "hush of dreaming roots" and eclipse twilight charge the final image; recurring oak roots subtly mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of nurturing wonder tightens via glow during totality, forcing Mara's engagement; agency in closing eyes and keeping curl, with felt relational cost in skepticism's melt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary magic emerges via curl's glow and reprise, but direct statements like “It’s not in the curl. It’s in us” create mild thematic echo, diluting subtext in final act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited voice stable with perceptual bias toward wonder; dialogue natural, subtext-driven (Mara's "It’s just hair"); rhythmic modulation peaks at glow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm in music/eclipses beats; minor paraphrase in "softly adaptive" repeats, but no loops touching closure; read-aloud flows cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eclipse, cello, and baby curl transforms wonder trope organically; risk in magical realism pays off in curl's glow without gimmickry.</comment>
