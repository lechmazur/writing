<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in atonement drives concrete micro-choices like folding origami until fingers bleed, earning his transformation to steady hands; embodied grief (hollowed shadow to burning certainty) shows contradictory impulses without therapy-speak. Interiority particular via wife's whispers and stencil memory. Minor backstory summary ("failed to save her") anchors present but slightly abstracts peak motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of crafting actions builds to shadows revealing invitations, culminating in CR closure ("rock bottom...a foundation") with felt emotional cost in new pendant amid glowing dome. Orientation anchored early (observatory, Elias, grief). Single scene fits defaults; no causality breaks, pattern taught via stencil alignment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory's rusted telescopes and glass dome constrain choices (aligning stencil, angling lanterns) and charge final image (dome as second sky, light spilling through cracks). Sensory details selective (cold stone, dust-slicing beam) filtered through Elias's priorities. Micro-setting (vellum stencil, lanterns) mirrors internal renewal without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atonement via curtains) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through shadow discovery narrowing to ritual completion; agency in persistent creation despite bleeding fingers forecloses despair path. Visible cost (physical toil, leaving empty pockets) alters stance, charging final certainty. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief refraction emerges from particulars (stardust pendants, origami coordinates, shadows as intentions), reweighted in final CR image (pendant with vellum sliver) without moralizing. Subtext in genuinely artificial bridging despair/renewal invites ambiguity on mending limits. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (stars/roots pulsing with memory); rhythmic prose modulates from subdued grief to charged glow. Lyrical compression taught early via stencil, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding; diction fits artisan lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "lit the first lantern, its beam slicing through the dust"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor elevated metaphors ("time pooled like mercury") voice-motivated, not muddled in peaks. Final line recharges motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mourning jewelry, fractal stencil, and origami coordinates transforms grief tropes into "curtains of intention" ritual; shadows-as-invitations turn feels inevitable from pattern. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry; irreplaceable conceptual integrity.</comment>
