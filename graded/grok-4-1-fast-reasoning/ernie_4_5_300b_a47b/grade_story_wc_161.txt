<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Concrete interiority in "chest tightened" and history-reinvention gnaw compel shift from cautious courier to personal quester, with contradictory caution-curiosity impulses acting in client-ignoring micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density buildup in dust/song decoding to CR closure ("map... of time"); dream realization line reconfigures options with conceptual cost of abandoning security, though weeks-pass summary softens tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dust motes under skylight constrain decoding method and charge final map image, with sensory attic details (old paper, wood polish) woven into action priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode/preserve echo deepens via dream reversal, forcing agency in packing bag with visible cost of ignoring clients and leaving pigeons.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Echo/balance theme emerges organically from dust/song particulars, with final "echo... humming in his veins" offering resonant non-literal reweighting of chaos-as-map.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with pattern-biased perceptual signature ("tracing arcs and spirals") modulates rhythm purposefully; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel effectively, but minor elevated diction drift ("dust motes swirled... like tiny galaxies") in early descriptive beat slightly dulls immersion without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh dust-cartography synthesis with pigeons/meteorite transforms lost-relic trope, with risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightening echo premise organically.</comment>
