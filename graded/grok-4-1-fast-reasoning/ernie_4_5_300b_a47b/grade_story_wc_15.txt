<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in poetic traits, compelling endurance with embodied cost ("fingers raw but steady"). Interiority concrete and particular, actions align under pressure. Minor slip: lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses, steady resolve without strong internal tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via sewing beats to RR closure ("labyrinth shuddered... in recognition"; plates "empty"). Orientation anchored early (Lira at canyon entrance). Cost legible in fulfilled plates and glowing thread reminder; persistent path constraints shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (junction symbols guide spiral path) and charges final image (mended stone, filling tide pools). Sensory details selective and POV-biased (poetic grooves, damp stone). Vivid integration into action elevates beyond vividness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend labyrinth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via raw fingers, sleepwalker pact, brighter threads narrowing to plate merge. Agency in sewing forecloses ruin path with felt cost. One tightening sufficient; minor abstractness in stakes pre-heart.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from sewing ruins to reverence, resonant in final image ("promise of what could be remade") reweighting without moralizing. Particulars (threads, plates) build complexity. Strong subtext in sleepwalker pact; invites lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct poetic perceptual signature (e.g., "paths twisted like a nervous system"). Rhythm modulates with intensity, diction purposeful. No head-hopping or elision issues; voice coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, propulsion aligns with beats; varied rhythm passes read-aloud. Purposeful metaphors taught early via voice avoid overwriting penalty. Minor figurative density in opening but coherent; no loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weaver mending mythic labyrinth via dream-threads transforms tropes organically. Risky poetic conceit heightens stakes; final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars. Non-obvious method infuses ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
