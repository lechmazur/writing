<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied ("chest ached," throat tightens); contradictory fear of drowning in pain acts simultaneously with stepping into hologram, earning final surrender of detachment. Veyra applies targeted pressure via prism. Final micro-choice to listen reveals values hierarchy with personal cost of brother's grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of whispers builds to pattern stabilization as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting inscriptions as empathy map with felt cost in etched lullaby. Orientation anchored early (observatory, Lirael chronicler). Hologram transition legible, one tightening via voices wash.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism and sextant constrain alignment and projection choices; variable stars' light pools like "melted silver," charging final dawn image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (dreamer perceives bent light). Details tactile and evolved (fogged glass to mosaic floor).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode brother's temple loss) signaled early, deepens via voices' density forcing endurance of burdens under Accumulative lens. Agency in entering hologram forecloses detachment path. Cost legible in "tide finding its shore" ache, narrowing to empathy map.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges via glyph voices and stabilization, final palm-press etching non-literal answer without statement. Resonance from particulars (brother's coords twist to warning). Invites ambiguity on healing cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual bias (stars as "mirrors"); diction poetic yet controlled ("gears whirring," "liquid" glyphs). Veyra dialogue subtextual, goal-driven ("Share the burden"). Rhythm modulates tension to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax; no loops, but minor figurative density ("silver moth in amber") in opener fits taught lyric pattern. Closure image clear ("glyphs glowed, etching lullaby"). Read-aloud rhythm breathes with emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dream chronicler decodes grief-mirror temple via stars/prism. Tropes (lost sibling, shifting runes) transformed by empathy language. Risky hologram-step charges closure organically.</comment>
