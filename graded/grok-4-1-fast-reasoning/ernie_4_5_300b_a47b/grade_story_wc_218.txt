<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation rooted in fostering harmony, with micro-choices like persisting through rumble revealing hierarchy of values; interiority concrete via hands tracing runes and chest tightening. Earned endurance in death forecloses leaving, with cost of life legible. Minor slip in repeated "brazen calm" phrasing slightly genericizes voice distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wiring to rumble-tightening to light eruption and harmony. Closure as Charged Poise in final sigh held by orchard, cost (life) undeniable in "time stretch, thin as copper wire." Orientation anchored early; time elisions legible without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: copper's "reddish gleam," stone "warm, pulsing like a heartbeat" constrain choices and charge climax. Final oak cradling sky mirrors internal alignment. POV bias clear in rune-tracing priorities; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (remodel for harmony) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via rumble reversal narrowing options to final wrap. Agency in wiring forces spirit confrontation; cost in "it hurts" acknowledgment and her death visible. One tightening sufficient, coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of bridging via "pain as language" emerges organically from wiring and spirit dialogue, resonating in final hum without moralizing. Orchard thriving reweights premise; ambiguity in spirit's laugh invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in botanical precision; voice texture modulates rhythmically from calm murmurs to climax breath-catch. Dialogue subtextual ("Why?" / "bridge") advances stakes; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences vary rhythm, e.g., short "The world shifted" accelerates climax. Minor paraphrase loops in "gentle and systematic" echoes (-0.2); no closure artifacts, metaphors coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dying caretaker wiring spirits via copper/oak transforms fantasy tropes through lived detail and conceptual cost. Risk in quiet death-heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
