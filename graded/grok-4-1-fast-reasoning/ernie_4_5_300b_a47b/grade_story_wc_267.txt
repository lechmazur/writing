<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elric's neglect of the bolt reveals internal contradiction between duty and philosophy, embodied in frozen hesitation; his speaking choice forecloses silent pact with felt relational cost to Lady Veyra. Lady Veyra and child apply precise pressure without headcount blur. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing ("Safety is not the absence of sound") borders epiphany but earns via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: poetic density builds via bolt neglect, scream, stain discovery to CR closure where Elric's echoed footsteps and voice reconfigure silence with conceptual cost of unraveled pact. Orientation anchored early in fortress/Elric role. One tightening via staircase realization suffices; no shards exceed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cobalt walls, frostbite air, and bolt constrain choices—wobble incites, staircase enables revelation; snow/ice mirror thawing hope in final child-playing image. Sensory hierarchy fits Elric's mundane duties. No generic placeholders; purposeful over vivid catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence's cost) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via scream ripple straining healers to Elric's voiced renunciation narrowing options. Agency in bolt-tightening/speaking forecloses shadow existence with audible cost. Coherent pressure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Silence-to-voice theme emerges organically via bolt, stain, piano notes; child's clumsy play reweights as non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor friction in Elric's direct articulation ("courage to listen"), but earned through particulars. Resonance from flawed pact, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature (shadow’s breath, moonlight cloth); diction/rhythm modulate from hushed to echoing footsteps under stress. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual—Lady Veyra's "speak" pursues goal, Elric's rustle advances closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short punchy post-scream sentences accelerate); high density integrates image/action. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors (frozen mercury, shadow’s breath) lacks peak restraint but pattern-taught; no loops or scaffolds dull closure bolt gleam/child notes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mundane bellhop duties with poetic fortress/nerve regen transforms silence trope via bolt/stain logic into hope's garden. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmick; no template echoes. Stain-as-map turn inevitable from particulars.</comment>
