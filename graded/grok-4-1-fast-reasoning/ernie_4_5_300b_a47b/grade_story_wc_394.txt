<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and embodied emotion, with contradictory impulses like scoffing at Old Thrum yet peering into the kaleidoscope, driving micro-choices under pressure. Final hurling of the arrow tip feels earned by years of obsession shown in concrete stylus-tracing and alignment. Blind spots in her "madness" compound into workshop shudder but resolve in irreverent awe. Hairline slip in minor stock phrasing like "heart raced" prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: kaleidoscope images → spiral alignment → glider launch → bell discovery → tip hurl, with on-page DC closure in the hum rippling through sea and workshop. Orientation anchors instantly in workshop/acid sea. Persistent constraint of acid mist eating tools shapes urgency. No slips touching closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurrent acid sea bubbles/roars constrains choices, mirroring internal yearning and charging final hum vibration. Sensory hierarchy spot-on: rust-taste air, gears clacking as metronome to restlessness. Workshop's mist seeping into cracks pressures timeline. Micro-setting of Skein braces and kaleidoscope glass integrates tactilely into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to ring unheard bell tightens via warning images (glider crash) forcing persistence, culminating in agency-driven hurl with legible risk/cost in shuddering workshop. Causal escalation narrows options: from theory to transliteration to dive. Minor abstractness in "unspool the future" slightly mutes visceral stakes at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transliterating yearning into motion emerges organically from gaps in spirals/images, reweighted in final hum as non-literal answer without moralizing. Irreverent awe in chest blooms ties subtext of mad persistence. Recurring spirals/bells shift meaning from chaos to dance, charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: "gears with feet" idiom, biased noticing of grooves/gaps. Rhythm modulates with intensity—short sentences in dive ("The Skein dove."). No head-hopping; voice irreverent and textured throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines like "spirals mirroring chaos" advance character/atmosphere/plot simultaneously. Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; read-aloud propulsion peaks in "whooped. 'I'm coming for you, bell!'" Minor register elevation in "prismatic light" but voice-consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk acid-sea world with "yearning algorithm" in arrow gaps transforms tropes into inevitable hum-unspooling. Risky glider-dive payoff from kaleidoscope transliteration feels bold and organic. No derivative echoes; conceptual integrity in bell's hollow mouth.</comment>
