<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as chronicler compels micro-choices like nudging the cicada and metaphorical dialogue, earning Kael's softening nod with relational cost. Interiority particular (ripples as world's pulse) and embodied (cold seeping skin). Minor epiphanic gloss in "pause had done its work" but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory/reflective beats tightens to Charged Poise closure in Kael's nod and tide turn, reconfiguring rush vs. wait with felt relational cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto details (silver walls, salt-moss scent, wavelet lap) selectively filter through chronicler POV, constraining reflection and charging cicada's emerald shadows in final image. Sensory hierarchy matches calm urgency; choreography clear across pool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridge argument via transition insight) signaled early, textural accumulation deepens via cicada handling to verbal seed-planting, narrowing direct confrontation. Agency in tangential approach forecloses rush; Kael's curiosity charges nod with visible softening cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transition-as-potential emerges organically from cicada/tide particulars, subtext in dialogue implication; final "sea agreed" image resonantly reweights directness without moral. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (observant details like algae dance); dialogue natural/subtextual ("what's your point?" reveals curiosity). Rhythmic lyric texture modulates effectively; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (read-aloud flows); purposeful figuratives (moonlight fractured) woven without muddle or loops. Minor descriptive density in opening but propels; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal chronicler frame transforms relationship trope via cicada's metamorphosis lens; tangential method risks quiet resolution organically. Non-obvious cicada glow/guardian reprise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
