<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict shines in contradictory impulses—resisting static yet pressing handset to chest—earning her final resolve; embodied emotions like throat tightening and clawed hands ground her shift. Herbalist applies precise pressure via whispers and laughter. Minor slip: human life pull feels slightly told rather than fully dramatized in peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (lavender to static) builds to CR closure in arrowhead's spiral etching and Elara's resolve, reweighting her mission with cost of shed identity. Orientation anchored early in garden crouch. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Underground garden constrains via shimmering air and soil-kneeling; arrowhead as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (petrichor sharpening to confessions) reflects Elara's botanist bias shifting primal. Spatial choreography coherent through pool reflection to entrance dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cryptid truth) signaled early tightens accumulatively via static deepening knowledge, forcing surrender agency; cost legible in arched-back thrum foreclosing researcher path. Herbalist's mirror reveal complicates without resolving. One decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of untamed harmony emerges organically from confessions-to-metamorphosis arc; final spiral/open-ended smile offers non-literal reweighting of civilization's grip without moralizing. Particulars like vine-hair and earth-pull resist binaries. Counter-reading (choice vs coercion) lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: scientist's symbols-to-primal thrum. Dialogue subtextual (herbalist's "played" evading direct reveal); rhythm modulates from humid dimness to spinning surge. No head-hopping; diction biased toward botanical-metaphysical.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels: "frostbitten hope curdling into resolve" layers image/voice without muddle. Rhythm varies (short crackle sentences amid longer builds); zero loops or scaffolds. Figuratives coherent (oil-on-water skin tensions surreal tone).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cryptid via static confessions/arrowhead transforms infiltration trope into gravitational play; risk in surreal fold (world folding) heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via mentor priming. No derivatives; bold premise commits fully.</comment>
