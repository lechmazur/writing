<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to capture the dream roots consistently in her precise routine and fear of loss, with embodied tension in ink-stained hands and feverish painting; internal conflict emerges in persistence despite doubt. Final embrace earned by prior causality, foreclosing futile chase with felt acceptance. Minor abstraction in epiphany ("etched into her bones") doesn't undermine pivotal shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from routine to pulsing paint and dream materialization. CR closure lands on-page with conceptual cost legible in "hand passed through the glow" yet embraced as internal truth, reweighting external quest. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via odd light suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archipelago and lighthouse constrain choices (eastern light position, crevices pooling light); sensory selection (salt taste, drowned hymns, light/shadow) reflects Elara's priorities. Final dawn hum charges closure image, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via anomalous light refusing to blend, forcing vitalization. Agency in feverish strokes narrows options; cost unmistakable in dissolving dream and futile reach, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of internal vs. external longing emerges organically from particulars (runaway story-dream, vitalized absence); resonant CR ending reweights premise without moralizing—"found not a dream, but herself." No tidy resolution, ambiguity in glow lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with luminous perceptual signature (light as ember, liquid gold); rhythmic prose modulates from hushed to humming climax. Dream's single line ("You’ve been chasing me...") carries subtext without disrupting voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but figurative density peaks in climax ("pulsed, alive... burst of radiance") borders overwriting without muddle; no loops or scaffolds. Propulsion clear, syntax varies to accelerate vitalization beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of photography-alchemy transforms artist-quest trope; vitalizing light into dreams inevitable from established method, risking poetic premise payoff in self-discovery CR. Bold lyric frame heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
