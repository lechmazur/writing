<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve ancient methods roots consistently in grandfather's rope and seed-collecting worldview, shown through embodied actions like calloused hands cradling glass; internal realizations build credibly without unearned epiphanies. Minor weakness: contradictory impulses feel understated, with patient discovery dominating without simultaneous tension in pivotal decoding beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as knot decodings layer density toward Conceptual Repricing closure; Elias's final placement of glass beside rope reconfigures the loom quest into preservation act, with felt cost in throat tightening and woman's departure. Orientation anchors immediately in dock scene; single shard fits scope perfectly, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dock, snow, and fog constrain isolation and charge final sacred image, with sensory details like creaking planks and muffled gulls filtered through Elias's natural-form bias. Environment evolves causally with thickening fog guiding the woman's emergence and deepening hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding for preservation tightens accumulatively via knot revelations narrowing to weavers-as-encoders; woman's intervention forces stance crystallization with conceptual cost in refusing literal loom. Agency in coaxing rope and aligning glass drives escalation without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of preservation as infinite patience emerges organically from rope knots and seed memory, reweighted in final image without moralizing; woman's "promise" line offers resonant non-literal answer to weavers' hiding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in natural encodings (e.g., knots as "coral reefs," tides) sustains third-limited POV; sparse dialogue carries subtext via whispers, with woman's tide-like voice distinguishing idiom. Rhythmic control heightens fog's hush without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and image integration (e.g., fulgurite spirals "pulsing faintly"); minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "watercolor blur" slightly muddles peak fog beat but spares closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fulgurite as decoder lens for knotted knowledge transforms myth into encoded science; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in hindsight-inevitable realization, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
