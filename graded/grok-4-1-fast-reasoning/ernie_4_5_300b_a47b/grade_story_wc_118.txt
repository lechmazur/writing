<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to collect wall stories drives consistent micro-choices like probing ashes and transcribing symbols, with embodied reactions (trembling fingers, chill) revealing interior conflict over ignored dreams. Final acknowledgment earns the shift without unearned epiphany. Minor slip in rationalizing Clara's ritual too smoothly, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (tapestry, diary fragments, symbols) build density to CR closure where recognition shifts the axis, cost legible in "ghosts, trapped in the steel" rising via hum. One tightening via symbol-diary match narrows to acknowledgment. Orientation anchored early (silo, post-dream world); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silo's rusting ribs, ash-cluttered hearth, and vibrating walls constrain probing and charge final hum, with sensory hierarchy (rust scent, lantern shadows) filtered through Elias's perceptual bias. Tapestry as micro-setting evolves to stir dragons, mirroring internal shift. Details tactile and purposeful, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore ignored stories vs. silence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening discoveries forcing recognition-agency; cost felt in prior "indifference" foreclosing dream-loss path. Tightening at "axis isn’t physical... shift in attention" reweights options for closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of perceptual axis/displaced attention emerges organically from particulars (Clara's charred words, fleeing dragons as metaphor), culminating in non-literal resonant answer: chorus fills quiet via acknowledgment, reweighting silence without moralizing. Counter-reading (stories as ghosts) lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature ("whispers of inanimate things," sensitive gaze on glowing eyes/symbols); rhythmic prose modulates to intensity at "dragons suddenly unfurled," diction character-bound. No head-hopping or elision withholding; voice coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "probed the ashes... found a fragment" layers action/image); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds, metaphors coherent (dragons' eyes "lit from within"). Minor overwriting in "bronze quiet" repetitions purposeful for tone, not muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-dream silo as story-repository with axis-shift via tapestry-chant recognition transforms ghost-story trope; risk in lyric accumulative build to humming walls pays off inevitably at closure. No derivative echoes; premise commits boldly to perceptual magic.</comment>
