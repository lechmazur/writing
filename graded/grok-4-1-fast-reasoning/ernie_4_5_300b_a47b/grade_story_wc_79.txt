<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in mother's expedition compels escalating choices like chipping the crack despite warnings, with embodied tension in trembling hands; internal drive shows via persistence amid collapse. Quietly driven trait constrains her standing ground at climax. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak beats prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: whistle play → shell split → tunnel/journal → watchers → CR closure where "The gate hadn’t rusted shut to keep them out. It had rusted shut to keep us in" reweights premise with city's heave as cost. Orientation anchored early in Thalassira on shells; one tightening via journal suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shells as micro-setting constrain chipping/passage and charge final shift; sensory brine/decay, salt/iron air filter through cartographer bias. Vivid grooves/etchings evolve causally. Recurrent shells mirror internal quest, guiding choices without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shell secrets/mother/watchers) tightens via crack-chipping agency → journal reversal narrowing to hunger warning; cost legible in collapsing tunnels/city screams foreclosing escape. Causal escalation coherent, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Patterns as countdown warning emerges implicitly from mural → symbols → journal → shells waking, reweighting myths; final image offers non-literal answer on entrapment without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like whistle notes echoing tides.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with cartographer perceptual signature (groove-tracing, pattern-decoding); voice texture in rhythmic phrasing like "air tasted of salt and iron" modulates tension. No head-hopping or withholding; diction fits urgent discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/paraphrase; purposeful metaphors like "fracture... widened as she stared" propel without muddle. Propulsion peaks in "shell split open with a groan," clear syntax under stress. Minor dense figuration in opener contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living-shell city + pattern warnings + hungry bones transforms tropes; risk in CR twist ("shells are alive. They’re hungry") inevitable from particulars, heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
