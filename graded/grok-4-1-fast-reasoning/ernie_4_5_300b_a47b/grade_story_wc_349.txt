<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find story origins drives consistent micro-choices like selling the jar despite warning, with embodied unease in staring at the empty space; internal conflict emerges subtly in her unsettled racing mind post-sale. The man's pale eye and knife apply precise pressure without excess cast. Final realization earned through residue swirl, foreclosing doubt with conceptual cost, though epiphany edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: poetic absences build density to CR closure in the dissolving note and residue, reweighting voids as origins with undeniable conceptual cost in "stories didn’t begin in grand gestures... but in the smallest, most fragile things." Orientation anchored early in library opening; one tightening via man's purchase ripples to return. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass panes refracting prisms and cloud-sea vividly filter Elara's priorities, mirroring voids; final stars reflecting panes charge closure image, constraining her outward step. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under lull heat; spatial choreography clear in stall-to-aisles walk. No white-room; purposeful selectivity elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (story origins) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via jar sale unsettling her belief, forcing reflective endurance; note's return crystallizes stance with felt void-price in empty stall gaze. Agency in warning and sales interweaves internal doubt; cost legible in "had taken something more." Minor abstractness softens peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of voids birthing stories emerges organically from jar sales, man's request, note reprise—final residue swirl offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting absences as fragile starts, without moralizing. Subtext in parole warning lingers ambiguity; no tidy binaries, complexity in potential's peril.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person on Elara yields perceptual signature in void-noticing ("silence before a scream"); voice rhythm modulates poetically yet precisely, diction biased to glimmers/absences. Dialogue subtextual—man's "could go either way" pursues goal, Elara's warning advances stakes naturally. No head-hopping; elision of man's fate charges poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines like "glimmering parole of unwritten narratives" propel multifaceted (image, stakes, theme); rhythm varies read-aloud, syntax purposeful in poetic compression without loops or muddle. No scaffolds, filter stacks, or drift; closure image ("residue swirled like stardust") propels cleanly. Varied paragraphs breathe with pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of absence-jars in cloud-library transforms trope of unwritten tales into lived trade with parole return; risk in fragmented lyricism heightens stakes via fragile note. No derivatives; premise commits to rules, inevitable in hindsight through quantifying voids.</comment>
