<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to trick fear roots in curse and resuscitation, compelling the climax grip on the searing thread with embodied cost. Vey applies consistent pressure via targeted whispers, distinguishing his flat tone from her hardening resolve. Minor slip in stock phrasing like "breath hitched" amid stronger particulars.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: entry leads to shadow encounter, dictionary paradox triggers recoil and dissolution, culminating in on-page Decisive Change with seared skin as felt cost. Single scene oriented early; no Orientation Test penalty. Closure image of pulsing clasp reconfigures options legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Funhouse mirrors and condensation constrain navigation and distort perceptions, cracking like ice to charge climax. Sensory mix (growl vibrating bones, ozone scent) reflects Mara's narrowing urgency. Recurring mirrors mirror internal distortion, evolving causally without overt symbolism.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to confront fear signaled early, tightens via paradox reversal narrowing shadow's options. Agency in voicing welcome and gripping thread forecloses flight path with seared palm cost. Vey's urgings complicate but cohere under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of fear as unraveling lie emerges via paradox action and Vey's final "lies unravel when exposed to the truth." Resonant without moralizing, though dictionary entry borders explicit. Final clasp pulse reweights premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias toward cloak glow and shadows; no head-hopping. Dialogue subtextual—Vey's flat "You did it" tensions with his cold smile. Rhythmic control heightens pressure in shadow swarm beat.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action and image, but figurative density ("diseased star," "fractured glass") borders overwriting in opening without full pattern payoff. No loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels to closure. Minor register elevation in "guttural growl echoed, vibrating in her bones."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of curse, paradox dictionary, and funhouse fear transforms horror tropes via lived choices like feeding the carnival a lie. Vey's ambiguous "truth that survives" adds non-obvious moral calculus. Risky tone modulation heightens stakes legibly.</comment>
