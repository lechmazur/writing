<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via chain link handling reveals adrift tension against teaching role, earning purpose settlement at closure; contradictory awe/smallness impulses act in final floating image without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density build from solo reflection to edge-class shard, landing Charged Poise RR closure ("sense of purpose settle") with felt smallness cost in final image; two-shard transitions legible, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Recurring chain link and abyssal pressures (cold water, intense pressure) constrain edge lesson choice and charge final vastness image; sensory selection (glows, softened spires) mirrors internal drift purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant adrift stake tightens texturally via student question reversal, forcing adaptive response that deepens to purpose crystallization; cost legible in "smallness of her place" during closure poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of navigating unknowns emerges via edge geometry particulars shifting to personal purpose, final image resonantly reweighting chain/stars without moralizing; earned via concrete lesson struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature (geometry-noticing bias) with rhythmic modulation under lesson pressure; dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishing Tarel's curiosity from Lirael's calm authority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety and density propel accumulatively, but mild paraphrase loops ("unfolded horizons," "edge geometry") across reflections slightly dull mid-texture without touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh benthic nav-by-aliens synthesis transforms relic chain into geometric tool, with risk-taking edge-lesson escalation heightening stakes organically; no derivative hedging.</comment>
