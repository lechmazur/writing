<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in acoustic perception drive micro-choices like positioning violin over bowl; final endurance in communal playing feels earned. Minor slip in overt realization ("Lira realized then") borders diagnostic but anchors in vibration embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from tentative note to resonant swell; on-page Charged Poise closure in "silence... a threshold" reconfigures hush with conceptual cost of unbinding grief, legible in crowd's tentative voices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass and bowl constrain/amplify acoustics, charging final image; "arched windows fogged with salt" mirrors internal hush vividly through POV sensory bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to break silence wall signaled early, textural escalation in note swelling via bowl narrows options with agency; cost felt in transforming wall to threshold, though internalization slightly abstracts peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in unfinished emerges organically from hush-to-potential arc; final image of offerings woven by music offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting ash as beginning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct acoustic perceptual signature ("hear subtle vibrations"); rhythmic modulation heightens swell to hush shift, no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric rhythm varies propulsion; minor metaphor density in opening ("glass cathedral") risks overwrite but supports textural lens without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of bowl as resonator transforms silence trope; fresh post-burn acoustics and harbor ritual risk bold payoff in communal unbinding, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
