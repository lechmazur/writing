<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong interiority through scarred hands trembling on frayed braids, revealing contradictory precision from past fire trauma; motivation to recover Lira's voice compels weaving micro-choices with embodied cost. Minor flaw: initial backstory summary slightly abstracts early impulses before scene anchors them.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: weaving card pattern causes glow escalation to beam and spectral manifestation (RR/Charged Poise) with legible cost in raw hands and forgiven past. Single scene coheres; orientation anchors immediately in sanctum/aurora.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (snowmelt-iron air, frost slot) filters through Kael's tactile bias, constraining weave and charging closure beam piercing aurora; recurring rope braids as micro-setting evolve causally, mirroring memory reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve forgotten voices) signaled early, escalates via density increase in glow pulses/shudders narrowing to vortex under lens; agency in reconfiguration forecloses fire-based past with raw-hand cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory as reconfigurable light (vs. ephemeral fire/metal) emerges organically from punched-card weave to illuminated names; final Lira figure offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in tactile scar-focus and selective aurora-shadow noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from calm reflection to intensified pulses without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in short, pulsing sentences during glow ("braids shifted, reweaving themselves"); minor overwriting in aurora veils/braids metaphors slightly muddles one peak beat but clarity holds at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost-wax precision with punched-card/ritual-rope mechanics transforms memory trope into inevitable reconfiguration; risk in spectral payoff heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
