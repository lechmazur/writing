<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (regulations vs. curiosity burrowing like a parasite) act in scene, compelling micro-choices like pocketing tickets; final approach and silent opening earn change with relational cost. Interiority concrete and embodied (shiver at recognition, heart pounding as instrument). Backstory anchors to present cues without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (doodles sharpening under lens, hooded isolation) builds to Charged Poise closure where "mistrust cracked like thin ice" reconfigures options with felt vulnerability cost in final shared silence. Orientation anchored early; pattern taught via tickets' revelations. One tightening via archive footage suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt and rain-mist constrain choices (doodles map it, concert site forces fringe positioning) and charge final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (hush resonates for registrar, glyphs for her dead-language habit). Details evolve causally, mirroring internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thaw mistrust vs. secrecy weight) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via lens revelation and footage isolation matching her past, narrowing to approach that forecloses isolation path. Cost legible in "heart pounding" agency and cracking ice. Coheres under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of non-verbal honesty emerges from particulars (doodles, lens, shared paper); final image ("between shared paper and shared silence") non-literally answers mistrust question, reweighting silence from isolation to connection without moral. Ambiguity lingers plausibly in "surrounding minds quietly listened."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (noticing "mouths half open underwater," "thoughts braided"); lyrical compression taught early via hush/glyphs, legible at closure. Voice modulates rhythmically with intensity, prose as character in shadow-between-shelves mindset. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture/atmosphere (e.g., "droplet on the crystal balustrades seemed to listen"); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops/artifacts. Figuratives coherent and purposeful (e.g., "curiosity had already burrowed... like a patient parasite"), no muddle in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mind-sharing world with analog relics transforms communication tropes; risk in lyric hush-pattern heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via doodles-to-approach arc. Conceptual integrity commits to silence-logic without retreat.</comment>
