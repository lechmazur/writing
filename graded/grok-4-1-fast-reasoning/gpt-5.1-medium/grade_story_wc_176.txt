<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in hands "knew only wax... what business... with sacred knots" act in scene; final endurance to stay earned by rewoven rope thawing guilt with embodied cost in "stung my eyes and thawed the old... apology."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of relic throbs to bells shivering to rope singing reconfigures options; RR closure in "fingers slipped free... rope fell still, humming like a cooling ingot" with legible emotional cost of softened guilt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rope fibers "warm, thrumming" constrain rewoven choice and charge final "humming like a cooling ingot"; ice/frost sensory hierarchy mirrors thawing internal state through shedding action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to redeem failure via names tightens accumulatively when "each strand... rewove, the bells... shivered" spilling sounds, forcing endurance; cost unmistakable in heat/snowmelt recalling cracked bell.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image "casting not in bronze but in remembered sound" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting memory-as-metal premise through rope's poured stories, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in casting metaphors ("pouring absence into a mold") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from chiseling breath to singing propulsion without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with "sibilant hiss spilled... laugh, brittle and bright... rope began to sing" propels climax rhythmically; zero loops, coherent metaphors like "punched card... curled like a yellowed tongue."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rope-as-organ-time-mold synthesizes casting/memory tropes into inevitable fresh frame; risk of lyric fantasy heightens stakes in hands' rewoven thaw without gimmickry.</comment>
