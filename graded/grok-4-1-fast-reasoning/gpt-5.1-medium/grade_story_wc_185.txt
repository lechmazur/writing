<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mapkeeper's interiority shines in embodied micro-choices like tasting the stone for "iron, wet basalt, distant ozone, and a thin seam of terror," rooting motivation in consistent traits; final conjuring earns stasis through prior navigational competence balanced by terror. Contradictory resolve (competence vs. storm's frenzy) acts in scene without alternating summaries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: orientation anchors in first paragraph (mapkeeper at caves post-energy beings); closure as Resonant Reconfiguration via "bloom of hush" cups storm with forged cost ("hammered into shape against the anvil"). One tightening via ice fractures narrowing path suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ice fractures and spore drift constrain choices ("followed the language... against the remembered fault-lines of his own heart") and charge final stone spiral; sensory hierarchy (harmonic hisses, marrow ring) filters via POV expertise, evolving with penetration deeper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conjure hush) signaled early tightens accumulatively via deepening density (storm ricochets countered by stillness breathing); agency in endurance forecloses noise-path with cost legible in "quiet is heavier than noise... shatter it," charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of stillness vs. frenzy emerges organically from particulars (echo stone vs. energy voices); final image ("great soft-edged emptiness that cupped the storm-sound") reweights premise non-literally, with ambiguity in hush's teachability lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (mapping "underthought," tasting resonances); voice modulates rhythmically from layered tones to inward petal, diction biased toward sonic fractures without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (e.g., "Quiet is heavier than noise" teacher recall anchors without loop); no paraphrase churn or muddled metaphors—coherent sonic forging pattern enhances closure image without overwriting in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic cartography and hush-forging transforms storm-trope into mineral-witnessed endurance; risk in lyric accumulation pays off inevitably at "hammer finally laid down," heightening stakes organically (+0.3 risk bonus).</comment>
