<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority and motivation rooted in rational delusion, shown in self-labeling as "consistent wannabe philosopher living in a sewer"; endurance of rebellion earned through layered flaws without tidy resolution. Limited micro-choices under pressure keep it from 9+; reflective mode prioritizes voice over contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from city description to cog to council echoes, landing CR closure in final image of "truth settles like silt... rationally rebellious rat finally digs deep enough to feel its teeth on metal" with conceptual cost of isolated persistence. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph; no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken sewers and cog constrain choices (wading filth, digging silt) and charge final image; sensory details selective via POV (shear marks vs. gods sneezing). Micro-setting of cog/environment mirrors internal rebellion vividly without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preservation vs. Council's disinfected history signaled early, deepens accumulatively to "rationally rebellious itch" forcing endurance; cost felt in isolation below rat line, legible in rising waterlines. Single tightening sufficient but lacks live trade-off in closure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. competing narratives emerges organically from cog's silence and silt-digging, reweighting premise in final "stubborn and heavy... teeth on metal" without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mechanism-focused noticing ("shear marks and the water damage"); rhythmic prose modulates philosophically ("brass teaches patience"), stable single POV with no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; purposeful metaphors like "city... half drowned, its avenues collapsed into canals" propel without overwriting. Minor generalization drifts ("people are not so honest") in mid-section but don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc scavenger-philosopher preserving cogs against narrative erasure; transforms tropes via silt-truth image, bold reflective risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
