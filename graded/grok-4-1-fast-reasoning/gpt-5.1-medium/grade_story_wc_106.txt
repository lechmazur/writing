<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority and micro-choices like hesitating over the jar reveal contradictory hunger for preservation versus superstition, earning the final realization; embodied in tightened fingers on camera. Minor abstraction in emotions slightly distances peak embodiment, but flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing closure: jar's release layers lights and portraits, reweighting theft premise with conceptual cost of self-theft in final image of brimming jar. Orientation anchored early at station; single scene causality intact via flowers-to-stranger-to-shutter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "moonlight already pooling in alley corners" and fading light constrain photo timing, charging final ordinary night return; POV-biased (light-obsessed). Micro-setting of station pillars and tracks guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of stealing illuminated moments tightens texturally via stranger's arrival and jar-opening deepening to layered viewfinder revelation, narrowing interpretive options with agency in shutter press. Felt cost legible in foreclosed innocence of theft, charging poise of uncertainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of theft-as-mirroring emerges organically from jar's transformation and prismatic portraits, offering non-literal resonant answer in "unsure whether I had stolen or been stolen" without moralizing; ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical perceptual signature in biased light-noticing ("tiny, patient moon") modulates rhythmically under pressure; stable first-person with purposeful compression taught early, paying off in legible closure. Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-rich ("You brought the jar").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image-stacked sentences; purposeful figurative pattern (light metaphors) coherent without muddle in peak viewfinder beat. Minor scaffold in adjacent light synonyms, but no loop obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of portrait-theft premise transformed through moonbeam-jar twist and floral codes into inevitable self-revelation; bold lyrical risk heightens stakes without gimmick, fully committed to magical-real logic.</comment>
