<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrator's shift from obituary writer to mapper of absences earned through shared walk; Lady Sera's motivation rooted in embodied pilgrimages with micro-choices like naming pains. Interiority concrete via familiar stir of cartography of wounds. Relationship crucible forces narrator's reconfiguration without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds via revelations to CR closure in "I knew then how to write her obituary... as a map," reweighting absences with felt cost of shared excursion. Orientation anchored early (cliffs to garden). One tightening in dusk walk pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garden constrains walk and charges final image ("dusk pooled thick"); sensory selection POV-biased (gravel silvered, brittle roseheads mirroring regrets). Micro-setting (moss-erased path) softens direction, enabling emotional geography. Details evolve causally with dusk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (explain absences) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via her disclosures narrowing to shared map; agency in joint walk forecloses isolated writing. Cost legible in confronting "places beneath appearances." Cadence shift at pergola return reweights under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of absences as unseen threads emerges via particulars (thread, walk, nothing disappears); final image ("carried her presence like a lantern") offers resonant CR without moralizing. Subtext in silence and gestures invites ambiguity on healing's geography.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (e.g., "silence brushed against my skin") with rhythmic control; dialogue subtextual ("not my death, my disappearances") advances via implication. Voice modulates intimately without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "measuring how far I can go without fleeing myself"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful (wake as stripped altar) without muddle in peak walk beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of traveler-as-cartographer and absences-as-pilgrimages transforms obituary trope; risk in lyric mapping heightens stakes, inevitable in "map of explained absences" hindsight.</comment>
