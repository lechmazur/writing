<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses in her dislike of mysteries versus gentle persistence shown in her mild confrontation of Kito. Final choice to declare anonymously is earned by revelation, foreclosing secrecy with relational cost. Kito applies precise pressure via his explanation, revealing community dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from waiting to Kito's revelation to reconfiguration. Closure as Charged Poise in Mara's bell decision and final silence image reweights anonymity as covenant, with cost in potential donor halt legible ("If you tell them... they will stop"). Single scene anchors early, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Arbor's terra-cotta tiles and wind create amplified quiet that constrains hiding and charges closure silence as "intake of breath." Sensory details (clinks, footsteps scraping stone) filter through Mara's POV urgency. Micro-setting (satchel, bell) guides choices and final draw-out.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (donation mystery threatening hope) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via Kito's reveal of intergenerational runs narrowing secrecy vs. unity options. Agency in Mara's declaration forecloses exposure path with felt cost in Kito's warning. Pressure coheres to charged final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet covenant emerges implicitly from particulars like rice crumbs and elder jars, resonant in bell's "cracked tone insisting they were still a people." Final image reconfigures persistence amid sanctions without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of secrecy's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable Mara POV with perceptual signature in "amplified quiet" and selective noticing (ink smudges, hitch in step). Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven (Kito's soft deflection advances revelation). Rhythmic control modulates from wind's sharpness to held silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with lines like "box sagging between his arms like it suddenly weighed more than he did" advancing character/action/atmosphere. Varied rhythm propels to closure; no loops, artifacts, or overwriting in peak revelation beat. Final line's cadence shift integrates fully.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exile resilience via anonymous runs transforming sanctions trope into covenant. Bell's shift from school relic to unity marker feels inevitable. Quiet closure risks stasis but heightens stakes through conceptual cost.</comment>
