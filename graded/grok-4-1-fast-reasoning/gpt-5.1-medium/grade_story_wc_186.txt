<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (stubborn certainty vs. mutinying knees and looped memories) act in scene, earning the closure renunciation of needing external answers via own voice; flaw of isolation compounds before fragile rekindling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to comet's "clean inevitability," delivering on-page CR where prism beams and voice spills with emotional cost of self-recognition; orientation anchored in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pavilion's humming panes and corroded steps constrain climbs and presses, charging final beam; prism as micro-setting mirrors internal hush, evolving with causal light capture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to prove meaning tightens via comet forcing star realignment, narrowing options with oil exhaustion and knee cost; agency in hauling prism drives CR under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final voice release non-literally answers coincidence-as-meaning, reweighting premise with fragile cost; emerges organically from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in retrocognitive "lightless flashes" and biased noticing (star paths over noise); rhythmic modulation peaks at "points snapped together" without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in "thistle-blown hope" recurrence borders pattern without full payoff, slightly dulling peak propulsion; no loops obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition, hush shard, and comet geometry transforms post-apoc tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens fragile stakes inevitably.</comment>
