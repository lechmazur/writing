<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aera's embodied fear as "bass note under everything" acts simultaneously with action, compelling higher-stakes percussion choices; grandma's teaching anchors reflection to present micro-choice of striking the mast. Final endurance of fear forecloses panicked inaction with felt cost. Contradictory impulses in prior paralysis scene earn closure renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density escalates from single tap to rhythmic dub reconfiguring snarled paths into branching futures (RR/Charged Poise). Closure cost legible in persistent fear carrying forward amid euphony. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating orchard constrains choices via tide-casks and ladders shifted for balance; recurring mallet and apples charge final image. Sensory hierarchy (brine petals, groaning ropes) reflects prophetic urgency. Micro-setting (damp planks, bolted roots) guides alignment tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stabilize vs. swells) signaled early; textural deepening via dub rhythm narrows options, forcing cask/ladder trade-offs with agency. Escalation coheres under lens as pattern break (snarled to syncopated sway). Cost unmistakable in trembling obedience and enduring fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (resistance as song) emerges from percussion turning obstacles, reweighted in final "restless euphony" image without statement. Subtext in clouds loosening fists parallels orchard's balance. Resonance inextricable from Aera's arc, lingering ambiguity in forward humming fear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Consistent third-limited perceptual signature (clouds as "charcoal strokes," notes as "trembling map") biases toward musical fractals. Voice modulates rhythm with pressure (short thumps in dub climax). No head-hopping; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "apples clacking like teeth" advances sound/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor figurative density in peak dub beat borders overwrite but pattern-taught via music motif. No loops, scaffolds, or coherence muddle touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating orchard prophet dubbing tides synthesizes fresh mythic ecology; mallet-cloud fractal angle transforms survival tropes organically. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes via auditory pressure. Inevitable hindsight from "dub the world until it answers" seed.</comment>
