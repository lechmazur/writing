<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when weighing the city's fall (risking valley lives) against eternal hanging, earning the compromise choice; interiority embodied via chest vibration and shard on tongue. No unearned epiphanies; motivation roots consistently in seeking "the prelude curled inside the farewell."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from murmurs to "hitch in the static" (turn) to becoming the city, closing with redirection CR (signal softens gratefully) and felt cost (moral trade-off visualized). Orientation anchors by paragraph 2; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gorge and towers constrain via creaking cables and rust showers, charging final image of "bolts would loosen during safe daylight hours"; sensory hierarchy (winds, moonlight slick) reflects interpreter's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (aid tower's ending-wish) signaled early, deepens via moral calculus ("cables might snap and people... could die"); agency in redirection forecloses paths with legible cost under Accumulative lens, reweighting via "sighing dial tone."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (endings as disguised beginnings) emerges via particulars like "rehearsal... inside the farewell" and final "new frequency had awakened"; resonant CR reweights without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on compromise's long-term cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (noticing "skipped heartbeat across the gorge") biases toward signals; rhythmic compression modulates with intensity (e.g., dissolving shard aligns heartbeats); stable first-person, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines like "steel cables groaned as if in embarrassment" integrate image/action; varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, figurative pattern taught early (ghostly objects) without muddle or loops in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal tuning (star fragment, hush shard) transforms abandonment trope into "accountant of miracles" practicality; risk in fantasy compromise heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via signal logic.</comment>
