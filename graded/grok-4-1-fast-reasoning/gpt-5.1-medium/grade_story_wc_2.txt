<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—banishing "Perhaps" yet following it—and final improvisation earned by lifelong clock-fixing habits with visible cost of renouncing certainty. Interiority concrete via embodied sensations like compass warmth pulsing "like a quiet, insistent heartbeat." Flawlessly individualizes Eli without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries layer to Charged Poise closure where "attaching hands that knew how to hesitate" reconfigures time-certainty premise with undeniable opportunity cost. Orientation anchored early in workshop/depot. Single tightening via compass alignment suffices; pattern shift from coincidence to pattern legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurring compass constrains choices (aligns "Now") and charges final image on clock face. Sensory vividness selective (hiss to roar, spray veils) mirrors internal uncertainty through action. Greenhouse clock stems evolve via Eli's navigation, no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs. uncertainty) signaled early via stopped clocks; accumulative deepening via compass words narrows options to improvisation, with felt cost in foreclosing "obedient rows" of seconds. Agency peaks in greenhouse hands attachment. One tightening charges final image under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of hesitant hands offers resonant answer to planning-as-trapping-time question, reweighting clocks/waterfall motifs without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from particulars like petal words (Someday, Perhaps). No tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in clock idioms ("seconds marching in obedient rows"); rhythmic control modulates from hushed hiss to improvised dawn. Lyrical compression taught early via ticking memories, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line layers texture or advances realization, no loops/paraphrases. Rhythm varies (short punchy sentences in descent, flowing in reflections); figurative consistency (vertical river, brass mouths) without muddle in peak greenhouse beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock-tinkering with possibility-compass transforms tropes into inevitable pattern-shift arc. Risky lyric mosaic (workshop-cavern-greenhouse) heightens stakes via uncertainty embrace. No derivatives; greenhouse clocks inevitable from priors.</comment>
