<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Charming rogue scholar's voice and micro-choices (forging permits, footnotes) reveal hierarchy of values under Ministry pressure; entomologist confrontation forces earned group expansion with secrecy cost. Contradictory impulses (romantic risk vs audit fear) act simultaneously in planning beats. Interiority concrete and particular, no epiphanies unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from setup to plan reveal and entomologist alliance (RR/Charged Poise); closure reconfigures rebellion options with ongoing secrecy cost legible in "keep lights off." Orientation anchored early in greenhouse wait. One meaningful deepening via confrontation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse insects/terrariums constrain choices (noise cover, grammar tests) and charge final image; gardens as "blank pages" mirror defiance. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (beetles as typewriters). Details evolve causally, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (plant-language vs Tariff) signaled early, tightens via entomologist reversal narrowing exposure options; alliance deepens pressure coherently under Accumulative lens with felt cost (altered tactics, labeled experiments). Agency in calibration and warping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of subtle defiance emerges organically from plant ciphers and insect grammar; final "quiet grammar blooms" offers resonant CR reweighting taxed thoughts without moralizing. Particulars (marigolds/mealworms) build irony over abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("beetles click like impatient typewriters") biases toward cryptic whimsy; stable first-person POV with rhythmic modulation under rising chaos. Entomologist dialogue natural/subtextual, advances alliance. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy insect chords vs flowing plans); metaphors coherent/voice-motivated ("bottled moons"). No loops, scaffolds, or overwriting in peak confrontation; propulsion weaves detail into action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxed thoughts and botanical semiotics transforms dystopia via insect grammar; risk in "candidly cryptic" dialect heightens stakes organically. Final bloom inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
