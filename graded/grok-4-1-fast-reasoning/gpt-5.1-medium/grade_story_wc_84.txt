<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira's drone pilot traits drive concrete micro-choices like projecting the schematic and mapping tones to stars, earning her realization; Leto applies relational pressure without stereotypes. Internal conflict emerges embodied in "static that has filled her sleep." Minor slip: final understanding feels slightly diagnostic rather than fully contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chip placement to starlight pooling in gaps to humming tones, culminating in CR closure where Mira maps faces to patterns, reweighting her haunted past with conceptual cost legible in "the quiet clink of a key." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Telescope and stone floor constrain choices (chip placement, eyepiece lean-in), charging final glow; dusk starlight evolution mirrors internal shift through drone-filtered perception. Sensory hierarchy vivid and selective, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode belonging) signaled early, tightens via starlight/tones aligning gaps, forcing stance crystallization in mapping with felt cost (old coordinates foreclosed). Agency in projection and tracing; one decisive deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of belonging-as-pattern emerges organically from chip gaps echoed in stars and faces; final image ("tunes her heart") offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting premise via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (drone telemetry hum to star tones); lyrical rhythm modulates intensity, dialogue subtextual and distinct (Leto's blessing-toned rebuke). No head-hopping, diction biased to Mira's sharp eyes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors purposeful ("luminous punch card") without muddle in climax. Minor figurative density in opening but pattern-taught; varied rhythm, no loops, clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone tech and ancient stars transforms tropes into cosmic kinship pattern; risk in quiet CR heightens stakes via chip's glow, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
