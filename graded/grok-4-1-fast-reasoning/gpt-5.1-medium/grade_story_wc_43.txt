<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of Mira's serenity and decisiveness in micro-choices like placing unopened results aside and gifting the shard, earning the goodbye ritual; Mr. Alvarez's traits shine via cologne and mundane hymn request. Internal conflict subtle but present in her need for "every ounce of that kindness." Final reunification feels motivated by prior anchors like shared songwriting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density builds from radio tuning and pocketed results to charged silence closure as Charged Poise RR with cost in "body... learning how to leave." Single scene anchors early; no orientation debt. One tightening via shard gift narrows to performance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: cologne's "citrus and pine" threads antiseptic, clouds constrain emotional lift ("above everything now"), charging final room-drawing image. POV bias sharpens details like oxygen tube on "brown face." Micro-setting (vinyl shard, guitar) guides choices without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye) signaled via pocketed results, tightens accumulatively through shard exchange and song to reunification with felt cost in departure. Agency in Mira's choreography forces crystallization; no abstract stakes, all on-page. Minor limit: pressure leans emotional over sharp trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of shattered holiness in mundane emerges organically via vinyl shard ("something shattered could still shine") and hymn, reweighting goodbye without moralizing; final "full, not empty" silence answers central question resonantly. Subtext in cologne/hope and clouds/escape lingers ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: Mira's lyric noticing ("clouds piled up in radiant tiers," "compact moon"). Dialogue subtextual and idiomatic ("if God is anywhere, he is taking out the trash"); rhythm modulates to breathy closure without head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but figurative density peaks heavily in opening clouds ("radiant tiers," "milk-white sea," "fields of unpicked cotton") bordering overwrite without harm to closure. No loops or scaffolds; strong verbs anchor images like "sculpting a pale line."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hospice ritual via broken vinyl talisman and "hymning the mundane" transforms deathbed trope into holy performance; risk in lyric compression pays off at reunifying image. No derivatives; voice commits boldly to textured particularity.</comment>
