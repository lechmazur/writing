<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in tending others' orbits while glimpsing unpruned personal patterns ("a star swallowing its smaller companion out of fear"), earning final endurance with cost in persistent "troubling serenity."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density builds to Charged Poise closure; gear constraint shapes tactics (listening to pings) and final image (pressing it recalls grandmother), with conceptual cost legible in "exile will have been more than a sentimental calculation" vs. doubt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Nebula garden constrains choices (nudging orbits, pruning trajectories) and charges final image (drifting among petals); recurring petals and gear as micro-settings evolve with perception under POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break burning patterns) signaled early, escalates via agency-driven deepening (gear shivers, violent glimpses force reflective endurance); cost unmistakable in sharper losses despite infinity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of gentle light vs. burning emerges organically from tending images, resonant non-literal answer in final "pattern will shift" hope reweighting prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (cosmic sentiment via "petals of ionized dust," "sonar pinging through luminous fog") with rhythmic control; stable first-person distance modulates beautifully under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful figures ("light grows slowly, diffused through hydrogen veils"); no loops, scaffold, or muddle—rhythm breathes with scene's quiet intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic gardening as generational therapy transforms tropes; bold lyric sci-fi risks (timeless reflection as plot) heighten stakes, inevitable in hindsight via gear-grandmother reprise.</comment>
