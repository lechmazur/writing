<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in mender's regret over contract versus stubborn pruning kindnesses, earning the final bargain with embodied cost via ribbon and vision. Flaw of generational blind spot compounds authentically before resolution. Closure choice feels compelled by prior micro-acts like tying the ribbon.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: orchard images densify from feral breach to petal rain CR, reweighting contracts with conceptual cost of shedding/renewal. Orientation anchors instantly in cathedral/orchard. No ambiguity; vision and bargain land closure on-page with uncertainty price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cathedral rafters orchard constrains via plunging branches and climb (bag tools), charging final petal dust image. Sensory hierarchy (creaking limbs, shimmering apple) filters through mender's glass bias. Setting evolves causally from buckling roots to hushed agreement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging wisdom via feral orchard) signaled early, deepens via apple vision narrowing to new bargain under Accumulative lens. Agency in persistent pruning forecloses contract path with felt isolation cost. Petal rain crystallizes Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Deciduous vows emerge organically from contract tear to tree bargain, final petal/voice image resonating non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity in feisty daughter's absence lingers ambiguously. No Thematic Echo; subtext in mirrored apple recharges priors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: mender notices "deciduous vows" and "quartz-eye" clarity, modulating rhythm from hushed green to rustling impatience. Stable first-person; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays in closure hush. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels: "Branches plunged through stained glass" integrates action/atmosphere sans loops or scaffolds. Varied rhythm breathes with scene; minor metaphor density in reflection purposeful, no muddle touching petals. Ear-test flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orchard-in-rafters premise synthesizes mending/grafting fresh, transforming contract tropes via feral spells. Risky CR (vision bargain) inevitable from particulars; no derivatives, bold voice commits fully.</comment>
