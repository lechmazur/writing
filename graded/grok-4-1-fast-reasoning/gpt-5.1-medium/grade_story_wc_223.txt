<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory impulses (logging exchanges vs. throat-closing restraint from correcting family) act in scene; final unbinding choice earned by prior causality of embodied crisis-survivor archiving with visible cost of persisted haunting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-taught walking/whispers accumulating to Conceptual Repricing closure ("unbind...gallery kept whispering"); cost legible in stone-memory persistence amid regime closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gallery acoustics constrain choices (whispers strip faces, footsteps spell into stone), charging final image; body-as-microsetting (heels tracing sentences) mirrors internal priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of gesture-archiving tightens texturally via pawn-haunting and closure rumors, forcing unbinding renunciation with felt erasure cost charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image of "routes of words only my feet could have written" offers resonant non-literal answer to absence/persistence question, reweighting prior whispers without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sounds as "swallowed confession," echoes as "luminous absence") and rhythmic control sustain reflective pressure; stable single-POV with no elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with layered images (e.g., "draft...nomadic penumbra") propels without loops or figurative muddle; syntax varies to match accumulative cadence, clear at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic archiving, scripted walking, leaderless chess transforms interregnum trope; risk-taking in textural closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
