<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (father's weaponized talent vs. her sheathed pacifism) act simultaneously in the engraving scene, earning final endurance with cost in buried possibilities; embodied in shoulders weighing like airship and barefoot earth-sensing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in final image of roses breathing engraved quiet, reconfiguring inheritance with felt cost of composted violence legible in "something will still lean toward mercy."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dome's cracked crystal sky and thirsty roses constrain choices (pruning under fractured light) and charge final image, with sensory hierarchy via her plant-reading bias; no orientation debt as anchors land by para 2.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weave continuity amid chaos) signaled early tightens accumulatively via hunter/raider vignettes narrowing violent options, with agency in endurance and cost in "grudges stumble over unseen roots"; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of continuity through engraved mercy emerges from particulars (rose phrases, sheathed talent), resonating in final non-literal image of violence sheathed among roots without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (tasting fear in soil, reading thorn angles) and rhythmic modulation (lyric calm under pressure); voice as character in "senselessly perceptive calm."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and no loops, though minor figurative density borders overwrite in rose terrace description; propulsion clear, closure image sharp without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms bounty hunter inheritance trope into rose-engraving archive amid dome-farm chaos, with fresh "engraved quiet" synthesis inevitable from particulars; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes.</comment>
