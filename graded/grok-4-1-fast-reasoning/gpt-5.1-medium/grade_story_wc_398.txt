<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tomas's motivation to nurture understanding drives consistent micro-choices like offering the letter, embodied in his "gently persuasive" voice; woman's contradictory laugh "bitter and warm" reveals flaws under pressure. Interiority concrete via vineyard metaphors tied to her story. Backstory block on proposal slightly exceeds BRR but anchors present dialogue without flattening stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: letter discovery accumulates to conversation deepening, culminating in Charged Poise closure where Tomas recommits to "guarding... the fragile, flickering chance," reweighting mismatches with conceptual cost of "echo between departures." Orientation anchored in first paragraph. One tightening via her confession narrows to rhyme insight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "ash smells faintly of crushed thyme and old perfume" and "autumn light laying a soft copper band" filter through Tomas's perceptual bias, constraining staging (pavilion shadow to bench). Pavilion and vineyard evolve to charge final darkening image, mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bridging mismatches signaled early via Tomas's mission; conversation deepens pressure under accumulative lens as parallels force her stance shift (shoulders loosen), foreclosing escape with felt relational cost. Pivotal "rhyme instead of overlap" insight tests commitment without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of mismatches as rhyming grapes emerges organically from letter, confession, and vineyard parallels, answered non-literally in final "echo between departures" image reweighting premise. Subtext in silences and implications avoids moralizing, though Tomas's lines border echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in idiomatic metaphors ("grapes ripening on opposite sides"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, e.g., "fruit is still fruit" persuades without declaration. Rhythmic modulation builds lyric poise to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors coherent and purposeful, e.g., "hand hovering near the small of the back" in pivotal voice description. Minor density in opening figurative stack but pattern-taught early without obscuring conversation propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sentinel's mission transforming missed-bus trope via vineyard logic and "rhyme" reconfiguration feels inevitable. Bold lyric risks heighten stakes without gimmickry, anchored in particular smells and ash fragment.</comment>
