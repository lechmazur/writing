<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grandmother's nod behind the mask at closure earns Mara's ritual endurance through shared fire survival, embodying contradictory tenderness/dread; interiority concrete in bowl's warmth and ash's exhale.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands on-page in final ash exhale and "nobody pretends they are safe," reconfiguring collective fragility under accumulative/textural lens with undeniable recognition cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ash lines on floor constrain viewer choices ("feet reluctant to cross") and charge final image as gallery "vanishing," filtering through Mara's artistic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of crystallizing "mirage of safety" tightens accumulatively via ash scatter and reactions (woman's laugh tests barrier), foreclosing pretense with collective cost legible in silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of ash snowfall and shared silence offers resonant, non-literal repricing of safety as mirage, emerging organically from ritual particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with artistic perceptual signature ("ash lines that have no declared meaning"); lyrical diction modulates to charged hush without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and concrete images (gray snowfall, charcoal streak), but minor paraphrase loops on "incomplete information" slightly dull mid-reflection without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh ash-scattering ritual transforms fire backstory into collective fragility awareness, with porcelain mask reprise risking bold ambiguity that heightens stakes organically.</comment>
