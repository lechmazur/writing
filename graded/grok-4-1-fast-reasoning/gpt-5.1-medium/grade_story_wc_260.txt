<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the hesitation over the tail tip ("old split inside her"), earning the final placement with relational cost to self-image; Mara's pressure reveals Liora's flaws without safety-hedging; diagnostic slips minor and embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from entry to tail placement (RR/Charged Poise), reconfiguring options with legible cost in "nothing left to trust in when she looked in the mirror"; one tightening via hesitation suffices; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vial/tail as recurring object constrains pivotal choice and charges closure sculpture; workshop's "shimmering stillness" mirrors internal states through action; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (wire gleams "like a snake").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (balance respect/compassion) signaled early, tightens via hesitation/placement agency foreclosing "clutch every scrap" path under accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in internal trade-off; moral calculus sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of balance as "motion, a slow reconstruction" emerges organically from particulars, answered non-literally by sculpture at crossroads and "matching gate unlatched"; reweights fragile convictions without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "quietly vivid care" and animal-like observations; dialogue subtextual (Mara's "Something honest" pursues goal); rhythm modulates to charged poise at close, POV stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (e.g., "Guilt travels light" propels); metaphors coherent (wire "gleams like a snake," "held breath"); varied rhythm accelerates to fox bark without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic tail as public "saint's bone" sculpture transforms redemption trope; risk in crossroads exposure heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from chameleon shedding motif.</comment>
