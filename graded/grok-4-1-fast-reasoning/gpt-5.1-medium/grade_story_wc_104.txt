<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to protect the vault roots consistently in strategic traits, with micro-choices like the timed cough revealing values under pressure. Interiority concrete via embodied observation of the Overseer's movements. Limited simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene slightly tempers score, but final guidance earns her endurance with felt chain-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: cough spills keys therefore she decodes Overseer, narrowing to final guidance as Charged Poise RR with legible cost in potential vault ruin. Single scene oriented early (carnival center, wall breach). Closure on-page reconfigures options via misleading without full resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (popcorn oil, chain rasp) filter through Mara's priorities, constraining choices (stool bolt, piano under counter). Recurring arrow/piano charge final decode image. Environment mirrors internal roots/freedom, evolving with action (piano hauled).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (impede vault destruction) signaled early, tightens causally via key spill to guidance, foreclosing Overseer's correct alignment with her risked position as cost. Agency in cough and soft speech drives under causal lens. Moral calculus between survival and resilience sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of chained freedom/resilience emerges via particulars (shackles for roots, misleading grace), reweighted in final image without statement. Subtext in arrow's heroic fantasy irony charges conceptual cost. No moralizing; ambiguity in outcome invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Mara's biased perceptual signature (decoding ego via pacing). Prose rhythm modulates tension (short booms, pendulum swings). Overseer's curse natural/subtextual; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "chains rasping like reluctant applause" advances sound/character/tone). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds in peak (key spill to guidance). Minor overwriting in opening metaphors contained, not harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival vault/arrow-circuit key transforms post-wall tropes via specific decode mechanics and chained agency. Final grace turn inevitable from strategic buildup. Bold risk in poetic tone heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
