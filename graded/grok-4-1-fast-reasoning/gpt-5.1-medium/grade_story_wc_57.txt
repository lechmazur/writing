<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eli's motivation to preserve methods roots in concrete traits like callused listening and gentle knot-tracing, compelling the pivotal decoding choice; embodied patience shines in kneeling through soaking snow without rush. Woman's brief arrival forces a micro-renunciation of solitude, altering his stance with felt physical cost. No major flaws touch closure; internal voice particular and conflicted under deepening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from rope shivers to memory-images, culminating in Charged Poise closure where Eli feels "seeds and knots...turn slowly toward another spring" with conceptual cost of endless tending. Orientation anchored instantly (Eli on golden dock); single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity. Pattern taught early via fulgurite pays off cleanly at woman's dissolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy filters through Eli's priorities: fulgurite veins and rope frays constrain decoding choice, charging final image of patient dock-altar. Snow soaking trousers and fog resolving woman subtly guide patience under pressure. Evolving details (thickening fog, whiter dock) mirror internal deepening without overt symbolism; tactile harbor hush lived-in and pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving knot-stories) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via deepening memories that narrow to infinite patience; woman's touch forecloses prior isolation with relational cost on frozen dock. Agency in coaxing knots tests commitment; fog pressure coheres without coincidence resolution. Minor abstractness in stakes legibility caps below peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory in humble knots/seeds emerges via rope-images shifting from boy-seeding to Eli's spring-turn, reweighting preservation without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal resonance to "ancient methods" question, embracing ambiguity of silent weaving. Subtext in woman's "let nothing be pulled taut without purpose" layers complexity organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing (husks as "hardened questions"); diction/rhythm modulates from hushed introspection to charged poise at woman's murmur. Minimal dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("You have been listening"), advancing closure. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught via fog-rolling elides time purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (slow coils to dissolving figure); high density integrates action/image ("lightning-frozen sand that chimed faintly"). Minor paraphrase loops ("fog rolled across the harbor" thrice) and figurative density in decoding beat dull propulsion slightly (-0.6); no closure harm or filter stacks. Strong verbs propel without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fulgurite-rope decoding transforms folklore trope into tactile memory-preservation; knot-stories as "epics from silence" inevitable from Eli's seed-philosophy. Risky lyric patience risks stasis but heightens stakes via fog-woman convergence (+0.3). No derivative echoes; bold perceptual ingenuity charges close.</comment>
