<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Obliging trait drives Ilen's key choice to tune despite ache, with embodied contradiction in "practiced comfort over lingering ache"; family reflection anchors present micro-choice without flattening pressure. Final allowance to "believe that time... moved sideways because he had asked it to" earns closure with felt personal cost. Minor stock phrasing in family messages but ties tightly to sideways time.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from explanation to grid projection, lever nudge breaks pattern with "sideways" drift, cadence shifts to harmonic stabilization as Charged Poise RR. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in "manifold fractures... lose both them and this valley's future" and personal musing. Single scene causality tight, no slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via nexus/prism handling and grid overlay on embryos; recurring "hush of beating wings" charges final image mirroring internal states. Sensory hierarchy mechanic-specific (coils "gleam like coiled frost," harmonic "felt along his bones"). Vivid, purposeful integration reflects priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (align dreams or fracture) signaled early, tightens texturally via sideways neural spark and prism steadying under Ilen's agency. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise; risk cost visible in Rae's warning, felt in bone tremor. One decisive deepening sufficient, no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sideways time emerges organically from delayed messages, embryonic intervals, and "sideways present"; final image reweights premise non-literally via stabilized prism and wings at rest. Subtext in silence around family ache enriches without moralizing; complexity in oblique emotional cost lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature (mechanic notices "heartbeat waiting" in lever, grid echoes). Dialogue natural/subtextual (Rae's "fatigue more than kindness"); rhythmic control modulates to awe-whisper peak. Distinct voices: Ilen's wry "romantic than it is," Rae's precise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture/pressure, no loops or scaffolds. Varied rhythm peaks in "neural spark drifted not forward but sideways," felt harmonic. Figuratives coherent ("colors chased themselves backward"), no muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanic fixing "sideways time" via creatures transforms sci-fi tropes; risk in subtle lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight from early "time moves sideways" intrigue to prism hum; bold voice integrates fully.</comment>
