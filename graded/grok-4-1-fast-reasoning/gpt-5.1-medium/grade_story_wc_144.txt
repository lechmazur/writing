<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in empathetic repair shines in "touched the hummingbird's chest as gently as if it were a nervous animal," earning the final activation through consistent traits; Clara applies light crucible pressure without diluting focus. Internal conflict subtle in drone's hesitation mirroring his blindness, embodied via touch. Final endurance of blindness reconfigured with earned smile, cost in perpetual darkness felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from mist/echoes to shared calibration, culminating in Charged Poise RR as drone orients "along the strongest line of refracted sound." Orientation anchored early in depot/shop. Closure cost legible in world's pull versus machine's prior confusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Basin/tubes as micro-setting constrain calibration choice, charging final image where mist "rolled in" braids with drone's buzz. Vibrations through floor mirror internal states, filter via Elias's echo-perception. Sensory hierarchy blind-specific, purposeful across touch/sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (drone's direction via feedback) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through patching/testing to activation under lens; agency in Elias's micro-choices narrows drone's hesitation. Cost felt in scarred casing's balance tug, foreclosing confusion. No reversal needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of decoding feedback into belonging emerges via particulars like chiming tubes/rails, reweighted in final "world arranged itself into paths he could feel"; resonant non-literal answer without moral. Subtext in Clara's ripples implying guidance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with blind perceptual signature (vibrations/echoes); voice modulates rhythmically, e.g., "buzz that seemed to braid" under activation pressure. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, Clara's idiom distinct/youthful. No head-hopping, elision taught via sensory limits.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm/syntax; figurative pattern (breath/mist, singing water) taught early, coherent without muddle in peak calibration beat. No loops/artifacts; "whisper of loosened screws" multisensory advance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind artisan repairing drone via sound-refraction transforms trope into textural drive; risk in lyric sensory prose heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via vibration motif. No derivatives, bold perceptual angle.</comment>
