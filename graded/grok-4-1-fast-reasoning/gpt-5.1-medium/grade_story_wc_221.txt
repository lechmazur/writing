<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied (breathing matching lazy sweep of stars); contradictory draw to distortion despite shutdown fears acts in scene; final endurance as pariah earned by prior isolation and family anchor, with cost in solitude affirmed by intruder.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of warped observations builds to Charged Poise closure in final line ("This is north enough for me"), reconfiguring fixed vs. fluid time with conceptual cost of embracing distortion; orientation anchored early (station above Nadir, sealed deck); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Viewport and gilded compass constrain (edge not crossed, frames distorted glimpse); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (charcoal fingerprints to light tails); recurring sketchbook as micro-setting charges final warped map image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart wavering sky as north) signaled early, tightens via dilation's embodied lag forcing slowed breath/stance; intruder ripples as single deepening under textural lens, crystallizing endurance with isolation cost legible in soft defiance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of direction over location emerges via particulars (fading charcoal maps to trailed stars); final image non-literally answers via warped sketch and spoken claim, reweighting premise without moral; no direct statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (space "folded like paper without creasing"); rhythmic modulation under dilation stress (lazy sweep matching inhale); single dialogue line natural, subtext-laden.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density (each line layers time/atmosphere/choice); varied rhythm propels (short sketching beats to creeping memories); no loops/artifacts, figurative purpose-built (stars "double, two positions at once").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi dilation and familial ritual transforms tropes; warped sky-sketch as non-obvious turn inevitable from pariah trait; bold lyric accumulation risks high but coheres to charged closure.</comment>
