<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional Jonas characterization via prosopagnosia turning blindness into grids and shadow arrangements, with methodical traits compelling painting choices; Rhea distinguished by motion; minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak painting keeps from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from mist buildup to Charged Poise closure in "a stone slipped, and both of them turned," reconfiguring hush with felt intrusion cost; orientation anchored early, one tightening via thickening mist suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist and quarry constrain visibility and charge final slip image; sensory hush/gravel POV-filtered through Jonas's light-shadow lens; purposeful economy integrates into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of awakening empathy via painting signaled early, textural escalation in ribbon's flutter and mist halos forces stance toward possible return; cost legible in broken hush, but no agency-driven reversal narrows to single deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of images unifying victim/murderer emerges via painting philosophy and ribbon's personhood; final stone slip reweights silence as potential confession without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with Jonas's perceptual signature in "planes and angles like chords"; dialogue subtextual (Rhea's skepticism vs. his belief); rhythmic modulation under mist pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, varied rhythm; minor metaphor density in "lance the armored hide" risks overwrite but ties to theme without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Face-blind artist's methodical ghost-painting transforms cold case trope organically; risk in textural hush payoff feels inevitable and fresh.</comment>
