<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the dream confrontation ("obey the directive now would mean dying correctly... living wrongly"), earning the final choice with embodied cost; name and playful trait ground specificity without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dream density and storm pressure reweight the obedience stake, landing Charged Poise closure in "he could press it... or he could climb" with legible cost of assigned death vs. chaotic life; orientation anchors early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bunker and forest constrain the climax ("water forced itself through old seams... doors cycled"), charging the final climb image; sensory hierarchy (roots scratching, thunder rolling) filters through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (directive vs. road invitations) signaled early, deepens via dream reversal ("artifacts noise; Foresight called them invitations"), forcing agency in wafer/ climb trade-off with on-page cost crystallized at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of prescribed paths vs. desiring present emerges organically through shifting dreams and final "steps into the present," reweighting obedience as decay without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature ("recording every rustle as if it were prophecy"); rhythmic control heightens storm pressure without filter excess or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("syllables catching on exposed rebar"); no loops, purposeful figures ("flake of moon") integrate without muddle, even in peak alerts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Roads "choosing walkers" transforms bunker trope through dream voice's desire ("we choose our walkers so the world can move"); fresh synthesis inevitable in final step.</comment>
