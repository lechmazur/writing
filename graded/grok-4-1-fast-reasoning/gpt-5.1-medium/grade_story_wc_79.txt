<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in guilt as "grain of sand around which dread kept spinning its own shell," embodied and driving micro-choices like ignoring council refusal; final carving/whistle earned by causal buildup of self-blame without tidy epiphany. Contradictory impulses act in scene (wants to question yet fears repeat expedition). No safety-hedging; flaws compound via quiet endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of cracking shell patterns builds to Charged Poise closure as turtles turn, reconfiguring options with legible cost in Keth's guilt and expedition echo; orientation anchored early (balcony, turtles, gate). One tightening via council refusal narrows to solo action. Cost proof: final whistle note shaped "from the fractured shells and his own restless guilt."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shells as micro-setting constrain choices (carving question into shell) and charge final image (turtles turn via pattern response); sensory hierarchy via cartographer bias (ridges/scars as "pattern languages"). Sunlight "hides bruises" mirrors dread. Evolving details (rusted gate pulses with turtle) lived-in and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (question watchers via turtles) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through pattern cracks forcing solo agency; council beat narrows options, whistle forecloses safe stasis with felt expedition-risk cost. Pressure coheres under lens without coincidence resolution. Protagonist endurance crystallizes stance.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of guilt-bound patterns toward unknown emerges from spiral maps curling to horizon and final turn; resonant non-literal answer in turtles pivoting despite dread, reweighting premise without moral. Particulars (reed whistle's last expedition notes) build irony. No tidy binary; ambiguity lingers in "whatever they saw."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pattern-obsessed noticing ("grammar in the tremors"); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive poise to terse peak ("Then the turtles began to turn."). Stable close third-person; council dialogue subtextual and sparse/natural. Voice texture via spiral motifs consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "Salt light glazed the roofs... bright enough to hide its bruises" advances setting/atmosphere/stakes); zero loops, varied rhythm, no figurative muddle. Propulsion peaks cleanly in final sentences. Read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Turtle-shell city and pattern-language cartography synthesize fresh premise; risk in lyric accumulative dread transforms tropes (lost expedition guilt). Final reconfiguration (turtles turn) inevitable from particulars. Bold world logic commits fully without retreat.</comment>
