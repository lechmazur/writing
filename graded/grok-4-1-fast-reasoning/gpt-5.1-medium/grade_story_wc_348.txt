<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's symphonic perception of polymers and rivers creates contradictory impulses in tracing foam versus lab return, earning final relief with embodied cost in "steady, unornamental relief."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds foam observation to polymer redesign tightening, landing CR closure in "guilt loosen into something more spacious" with rearrangement cost legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Braided ravine's foam patterns constrain sketching choices and charge chrysalis final image, with sensory weave ("water argue," "woven murmurs") mirroring internal divergence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grief stake deepens via foam insight agency narrowing to redesign under accumulative lens, with prototype relief as unmistakable on-page cost foreclosing explosive paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>River-polymer parallels offer resonant answer to separation via "nothing was truly lost, only rearranged," reweighting divergence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Symphonic perceptual signature ("harmonies where others heard only data") and rhythmic modulation sustain lyric pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High-density lines like "foam lines thinned and wavered; where they merged, swirls tightened into bright knots" propel insight with zero loops or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>River-foam-to-polymer grief synthesis transforms atonement trope into fresh material innovation, inevitable in chrysalis-charged closure.</comment>
