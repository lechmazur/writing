<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied interiority shines in "felt in her teeth" and contradictory unease propels interference; final gambler shift earned via mapped patterns. Minor reflective summaries of correlations slightly abstract motivation without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup to Charged Poise closure in Void's swell "rattled the window glass and steadied her breathing," legible cost in her risked interference. Single scene oriented early; no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Studio console and charts constrain rewriting/script alignment, charging final sync; sensory hierarchy (subsonic teeth-thrum to hiss) filters via radio expertise. Tower looms purposefully without white-room drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (save Void via student mischief) tightens agency-driven to subsonic broadcast, escalation via density to response under Accumulative lens; cost in ignored text and rattled glass unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mischief/power theme emerges organically from signal "applause" to her manifesto, final swell reweights human hope vs. sale without moralizing. Particulars like inked charts avoid abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in radio-celestial diction ("tuning fork jammed into the clouds"); rhythm modulates from hum to swell without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels to closure; no loops, metaphors cohere (e.g., "two hearts negotiating"), read-aloud rhythm accelerates perfectly in interference beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Subsonic cosmic trickster premise transforms radio tropes via charts/script sync; risk of interference heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
