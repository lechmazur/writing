<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via taste ("regret steeped in cardamom") and embodied conflict (bracing against coral during memory flood) reveal Rafi's hierarchy of values under pressure; final endurance of processing heavier remorse earned by prior caution (hands in sleeves). Minor diagnostic phrasing ("sandpaper rough memories") edges toward abstraction without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from courtyard pools to pavilion tasting, culminating in Charged Poise RR at night's hush and "fortress returned to its own uneasy sleep," reconfiguring storage premise with conceptual cost of lingering unease legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy (smell of cumin/wet stone narrowing to shard chimes) filtered through chef's priorities constrains descent via cracked tile pool; coral tables as recurring micro-setting charge closure by mirroring processed remorse's half-buried state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of balancing usable vs. buryable remorse tightens accumulatively through shard tastings, with agency in grating decision foreclosing overload; cost visible in "shaking hands" after soldier's memory and soldiers' paused spoons, though no single reversal dominates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of remorse as inescapable yet sandpapered emerges implicitly from tasting/decision beats, resonant in final "blades dulled just enough not to draw blood," reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in synesthetic noticing ("taste memories," pools as tea leaves); rhythmic modulation peaks in tasting ("memory burst: a slap") without filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("pried up the tile, fingers careful, and cold air breathed out"); figurative pattern taught early (fortress as exhaling chest) purposeful, but density overloads high-pressure tasting beat with mixed vehicles ("quiver...burst...eddies"). Minor template stems in descent ("spiraled down...hummed faintly").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic chef premise with coral remorse vault transforms memory trope organically; risk in emotional contagion constraint heightens stakes via pavilion brace without gimmick.</comment>
