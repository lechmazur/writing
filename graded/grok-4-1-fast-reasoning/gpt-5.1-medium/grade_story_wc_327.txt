<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Storyteller's motivation to translate textures compels merging choice at climax; interiority embodied in veins, throat scratch; endurance of curse costs personal voice-braiding, earned by prior micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from footfalls to voices/birds; RR closure in final singing image reconfigures stake with merging cost legible in "braided into the canyon's dying language."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tunnel textures/walls constrain reading via diamond; towers shed powder mirroring internal merge; body/diamond as micro-setting charges final bird alignment, POV-filtered selectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive dying language) signaled early, tightens texturally via warped echoes to voice-merging; agency in harnessing forecloses isolation with felt personal cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of cursed bridges/merging emerges via particulars (diamond flaws, bone dust); final image reweights premise non-literally as "every story... entwined," lingering ambiguity without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (textures as sound-seeds); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, prose-as-character in "quietly articulate" repetitions taught as voice-trait.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; figurative language purposeful for textural theme without muddle; minor density overload in climax metaphors dings propulsion slightly, but no loops/scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of diamond/crane grammar into canyon-language revival; risks lyric accumulation heightening stakes, inevitable hindsight reconfiguration via bird-vein merge.</comment>
