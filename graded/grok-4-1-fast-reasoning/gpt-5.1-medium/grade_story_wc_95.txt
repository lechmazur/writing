<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied mechanical arm clicks and ray-reading as philosophy; contradictory waiting/fencing impulses act in scene. Final realization earns reconfiguration with cost in reconsidered tin pattern. Visitors apply immediate relational pressure without headcount blur.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layers of tin, sundial, light build to CR closure in "hidden overture finally began," reweighting setup with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early (atrium, brook, waiting). One tightening via tin spiral matching sundial; vignette scope fits single scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sundial rays and half-painted fractures constrain mediation choices, charging final chaos image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (angles as questions); glass atrium/brook tactile and purposeful. No white-room: spatial choreography coherent through lunges to sundial angling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rerouting quarrels) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via tin realization narrowing to destinations. Visitors' "ownership of tomorrow" crystallizes stance; agency in angling sundial forces trade-off. Cost legible in poised reconfiguration, but stakes verge abstract without deeper turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of geometry-as-music emerges organically from tin/sundial particulars, reweighted in final overture image without moralizing. Subtext in waiting stances invites ambiguity; resonance from flawed endurance of hesitation. No tidy binary: chaos dignifies complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (light/angles as arguments); diction/rhythm modulate to philosophical texture. Brief dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("where your questions wish to go"), distinct from narration. No head-hopping; compression purposeful in revelations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "rebuttals made of thrust"); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting in figurative density mid-scene ("tiny swords," "overture in architecture") borders muddle but pattern-taught. No loops; clean grammar, varied syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fencing philosophy, sundial mediation, needle overture transforms duel trope organically. Risk in vignette poise heightens conceptual stakes; inevitable hindsight from early tin seed to chaos payoff. No derivatives: singular vision commits to premise.</comment>
