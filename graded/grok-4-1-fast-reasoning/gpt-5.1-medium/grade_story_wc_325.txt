<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied concretely ("crawled up from his spine like cold water") drives micro-choices against panic; motivation to "stand by the unremembered" intensifies to compel final turn with felt cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene (payday vs. voices). Minor diagnostic phrasing in lab notes reflection slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of discovery trails to Charged Poise closure ("He turned for the exit, the sphere whispering of return") with legible cost (temporal drift warning forecloses deeper stay). Orientation anchored early (hatch entry by ~100 words). Single continuous scene fits defaults; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (pressure fractures, rust-choked stairs narrow path; rig threads guide amid decay). Sensory hierarchy vivid/POV-specific ("crashing hush" recurs tactilely); cables as "black roots" charge final image. Micro-setting (sphere cradle) mirrors internal pull without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve artifact vs. honor unremembered) signaled early, tightens via rig trail/sphere lift under time pressure; one deepening (gold resonates with sphere) narrows options. Agency in endurance (fights panic to core) forecloses paths with cost (tidal warning). Escalation coherent accumulatively to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of captured presences/unremembered emerges from particulars (cable "ghost transmissions," sphere as "net for souls"); final whisper reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in silence/images (open codex, negative-mass sphere) invites ambiguity. Internal arc inextricable from question of memory vs. survival.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (claustrophobic metal vs. honest rock); rhythmic modulation under stress (short breaths in tight ceilings). Voice texture poetic yet legible ("sea breathed like a sleeping beast"). No dialogue; elisions purposeful/charged.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density/propulsion: metaphors consistent ("crashing hush" motif varies without muddle), rhythm accelerates in core ("rig flashed a warning"). Zero loops/scaffold; varied syntax supports ear test. Minor density in opening risks slight overwrite but serves accumulative build untouched at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cable soul-separator via phase transitions transforms salvage trope into conceptual haunt; risk in lyric poise heightens stakes. Irreplaceable details (gold calibrant, negative sphere) feel inevitable. No derivative echoes; bold undersea frame commits fully.</comment>
