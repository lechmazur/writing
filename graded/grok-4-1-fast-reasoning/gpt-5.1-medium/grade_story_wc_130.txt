<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the conjuring (reach through vs. cost of tearing branches), earning the pivot to acceptance with embodied cost in sweat and fraying image. Interiority particular via "arithmetic of missing steps." Final micro-choice reveals values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds to fraying reflection then spell-shift RR (Charged Poise in future vision), cost legible in "ripping fruit from futures." Single scene coherent, orientation anchored by orchard intro.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stalactite drips constrain ritual (hesitate midfall, resume ticking at end, charging closure). Orchard trunks "bruised with shadow" mirror internal ache. Micro-setting (mosaic stone) guides choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve via math-emotion) tightens texturally when image frays, forcing agency-shift to acceptance; cost unmistakable in "tearing open every branch." Escalation driven by Corren's deepening realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image (self teaching children amid drips) resonates non-literally on math-emotion question, reweighting retrieval to endurance without moralizing. Emerges organically from ritual failure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "unfinished things listen closely," rhythmic control peaks in incantatory "ratios of longing to memory." Stable close third, elision of backstory anchors present choices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "cavern orchard seems to lean in"); metaphors coherent/patterned (spirals, dovetail). Varied rhythm, zero loops; minor figurative density in climax hairline slip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: glass eyes + mosaic + math-emotion transforms ambiguous loss via gentle magic. Risky lyric texture inevitable in hindsight; no tropes unearned.</comment>
