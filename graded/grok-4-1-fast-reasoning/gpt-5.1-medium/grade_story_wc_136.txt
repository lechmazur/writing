<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in "certainty trembled, but it was certainty all the same" and stepping through; final whisper earns change via prior mapping obsession with visible cost to composure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of cracks/maps/silences builds to CR closure ("someone must finally map the way back"); cost legible in "trembling certainty" final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Recurring maps on columns constrain interpretation and charge ending; vivid sensory integration like "wet iron and paper" purposefully mirrors mapping motif without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of mapping impossible tightens accumulatively through cracks/doorway to revelation, narrowing options with agency in daring step; cost felt in fractured sleep and final duty repricing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silences/routes emerges organically via conductor's "routes by walking away"; resonant non-literal answer in final line reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mapping everything ("geometry in grocery lists"); dialogue subtextual and advancing, voice modulates rhythmically under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies propulsively, metaphors consistent (mapping/pulsing lines) without muddle in peak station reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapping silences transforms portal trope via grounded particulars like pavement arrows; risk in mist-vapor trains heightens stakes organically.</comment>
