<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orin's steadily curious trait shows contradictory impulses—snorting at the "drama queen" Algorithm yet feeling "irreverent awe" creep in—culminating in the earned choice to launch despite the "leash" sting, with visible cost in "wildly unprepared."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building through revelations to CR closure at "a bell realized it existed, and the world shuddered politely," reweighting reality with cost legible in Orin's whoop into "ringing silence" and unpreparedness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kaleidoscope and arrow tip constrain choices—transliterating patterns and mounting for launch—while charging the final image of the "bruise-colored wound in the sky"; acid sea hisses offensively, mirroring reckless ascent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to enable the Algorithm tightens accumulatively via leash revelation, forcing Orin's endurance with felt cost in "lodged in his ribs," narrowing to launch agency under textural pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mechanical yearning reconfiguring reality emerges organically, with final "whoop into the ringing silence" offering resonant non-literal answer to striking the future awake, reweighting Orin's recklessness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in lines like "drama queen made of spinning gears"; dialogue natural with subtext (Kalei's shrug of faith), modulating rhythm under launch stress without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm—no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; propulsion peaks in "drunken yanking" launch, every line advancing texture toward closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of yearning Algorithm, glider dialect, and arrow-seed premise transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in CR closure ("world shuddered politely") heightens stakes inevitably from particulars.</comment>
