<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kenji's motivation rooted in oath drives higher-stakes listening, with contradictory hesitation embodied in careful bench-sitting; earned shift to shared loneliness via confessions; voice distinct in dialogue without convergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as confession density tightens to resonant reconfiguration in final line "loneliness shifted from singular to shared," with conceptual cost of chain's continuity legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivy trembling at moon rock and platform's cracked map constrain experiment choreography and charge shared truths image; sensory details (rust, fern) filtered through priorities, mirroring unfinished chains.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (loneliness cure without breaking chain) signaled early, accumulates via confessions narrowing to heavier listening; agency in holding rock forces trade-off, cost felt in embodied weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reciprocity theme emerges organically from oath, shelves of stalled objects, and final shared truths reweighting loneliness without moral; resonant non-literal answer in closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in phrases like "politely closed parentheses"; dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, e.g., Mara's height quip evades while advancing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; metaphors coherent, e.g., "sand[ed] smooth by uncountable waiting" propels without overwriting in peak confession beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of moon rock oath and confession exchange transforms loneliness trope; risk in polite anarchy tone heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via reciprocity chain.</comment>
