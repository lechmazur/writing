<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (longing for alignment vs. empirical distrust) act vividly in the planet's exact node hit, earning the final renunciation of certainty with gambled years as felt cost; interiority particular via "encrypted devotion."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from star offsets to planet alignment and cloud uncloaking, delivering CR closure ("usable doubt") with legible cost in "gambled their remaining years"; orientation anchored by dusk arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floodlit courtyard grid constrains projection choice and charges final stillness/planet node; "dusky harmony of incense, dust, and low electrical hum" selectively mirrors encrypted devotion without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stellar alignment as covenant) tightens via near-misses to planet's "exact" node, reweighting under Accumulative lens with agency in light adjustments; cost unmistakable in "gambled their remaining years on a hunch."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of "quiet, usable doubt" resonantly reweights ironic empiricism without moralizing, emerging from failed alignments to smudged-note stars; ambiguity lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("numbers instead of prayers," "schematic representations") modulates rhythmically under pressure, with stable close-third POV; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("beams rose like invisible columns"); zero loops/artifacts, purposeful figurative control in peak (planet slide) without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Babylonian tile, museum lights, and stellar covenant transforms mysticism/empiricism tropes; risk in solo experiment heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via tile's warmth.</comment>
