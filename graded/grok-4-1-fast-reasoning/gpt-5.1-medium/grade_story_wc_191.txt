<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular (truth "tasted heavy, like metal"), contradictory impulses act in climbing despite future's plea, final refusal earned by archival trait under erasure threat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising through layers to CR closure; ruby flake sunk in stair delivers legible conceptual cost ("no throne remained, only memory"); orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orchard hourglasses and paint layers constrain choices, waterfall/ozone taste grounds entry; recurring lenses/fruit charge final memory image without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truthful memory for throne) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via countdown visions narrowing to refusal; agency in flake insertion forecloses polished future with erasure cost felt in stalled constellations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of raw vs. curated memory emerges organically through peeling/climbing particulars, CR ending reweights premise non-literally ("throne... only memory") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (archival tastes like ozone/citrus); rhythmic modulation accelerates in climb, distinct futuristic-nostalgic texture throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "each step replaying... static of forgotten names"); varied rhythm propels to peak, coherent metaphors (paint "autumn leaves") avoid muddle even in descriptive beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms memory-edits trope into mythic refusal, throne dissolution inevitable from painted layers/murals; risk in open CR heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
