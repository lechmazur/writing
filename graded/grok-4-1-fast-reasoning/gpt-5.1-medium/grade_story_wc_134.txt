<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyra's contradictory clairvoyance—polishing lenses nervously yet freezing at the pearl—earns her humbling bow as a micro-choice revealing value hierarchy with professional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as cave's song density breaks patterns, culminating in pearl's hover and CR closure where Lyra's rehearsed vision dissolves with felt humility cost on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Musical crystals and cave pearl constrain Lyra's reach and charge the final settling image, with sensory details (chiming ankles, swirling pearl) filtered through Lyra's failed hearing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake on everyday magic vs. grand futures tightens via pearl's unscripted rise and overlay visions, forcing Lyra's stance crystallization; cost legible in her cracking certainty, though more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pearl vignettes reweight ordinary acts as galactic treasure, offering non-literal answer to prediction vs. presence without moralizing; resonance emerges organically from cave's modulating chord.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (echoes singing names, shadows remembering) sustains under pressure; dialogue subtextual (Mira's "not the kind anyone can schedule") with distinct voices, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion varies with scene (short sentences at pearl rise), high density, but figurative density ("bright darkness dripped," stacked in opening) slightly muddles early pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesis of singing rocks teaching humility transforms clairvoyance trope; risk in steadily unpredictable music heightens stakes, inevitable in pearl's "perfectly true" beat.</comment>
