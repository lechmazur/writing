<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction between vengeful control ("hand on the tilt of its descent") and redemptive repair, embodied in geode's heat and final thumb-pressure choice; flaws like bleak exhilaration drive inevitable pivot without safety-hedging. Final nudge earns closure via prior causality. Hairline slip in occasional diagnostic phrasing, but doesn't touch peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mission feeds to village anomaly tightening into personal crater realization; on-page CR via "nudge the model toward repair" reconfigures stance with felt cost (self-facing). Orientation anchors early in observatory/desert. Single scene coherence flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Geode and console vortices as micro-settings constrain choices (thumb on geode, reroute power), charging final image; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (crystal hums with engines, feeds "bleed light"). Economy perfect, no white-room. Recurrent desert/rubble mirrors internal crater.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hunt unused potential) signaled early, escalates via anomaly deepening that forces inward turn under Accumulative lens; agency in "rerouting more processing power" forecloses ruin-path with personal cost. One tightening sufficient, but abstract probability clouds slightly mutes visceral price until end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of stolen potential emerges organically from wedding rubble to village vortex, reweighted non-literally in repair-nudge; geode reprise shifts perturbation from ruin to redemption. Resonant CR without moralizing. Complexity in exhilaration's duality lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("names are shrapnel," "probability clouds shimmer") biases toward fractured futures; rhythmic modulation peaks in short, charged final sentences. Stable first-person, no elision issues. Voice as character: syntax fractures with stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm (long reflective to punchy "My hands move"); metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (vortices, wells). Minor overwrite in figurative density ("bleeding constellations," "violet teeth") during opener risks slight slowdown, but no loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum perturbation as personal drone-trauma echo, transformed via inward hunt; risk in poetic sci-fi voice heightens stakes. Village anomaly turn inevitable from geode seeding. Non-obvious moral calculus on control vs. repair.</comment>
