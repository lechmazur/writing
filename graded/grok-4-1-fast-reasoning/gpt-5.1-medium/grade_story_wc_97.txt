<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leon’s contradictory impulses—hovering in longing vs. striking the next chord—act simultaneously in the arbor reunion, earning the final invitation with visible cost of foreclosed hesitation. Mara’s trait-driven wariness forces his improvisation. Minor slip: one overt realization (“Leon realized... refuge for unfinished moments”) borders on unearned epiphany but doesn’t touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density (clock, reels, compasses) tightening to Charged Poise closure: Mara’s hand-reach and laugh reconfigure hesitation into offbeat commitment, with legible cost in swayed bench and unfolding pathways. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (station, piano, clock). One deepening via compass flare suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tidal arbor’s roots and mist waves constrain choices (walkway, swaying bench), charging final image as pathways sketch in monochrome. Compass/object micro-setting reweights regrets. Sensory selection (chrome-blue sky, purple rim) reflects Leon’s perceptual bias; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reunite/improvise beyond hovering) signaled early via endless playing; textural escalation via arbor density and compass flare narrows options, forcing Leon’s invitation with agency-felt cost (frozen clock challenges stillness). Coheres under Accumulative lens; one tightening charges closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of improvisation over rehearsed endings emerges organically from particulars (frozen pendulum, flickering needles, unplanned encore); final hand-reach/laugh offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting hesitation without moralizing. Subtext in Mara’s “muted trumpet” voice layers ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV on Leon with perceptual signature (musical metaphors like “dissonant chord resolving”); dialogue natural/subtextual (“You were supposed to stay” pursues accusation/wonder). Rhythmic prose modulates with arbor intensity; voices distinct (Leon’s stubborn calm vs. Mara’s wary improvisation).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: lines like “roots arched like a rib, catching slow-motion waves of mist” advance atmosphere/action without loops. Varied rhythm supports read-aloud propulsion; figurative language consistent/musical, no muddle in peak arbor reunion. Zero scaffolds or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: film-reel portals to regret-arbor transforms portal/afterlife tropes via pianist motifs, culminating in irreplaceable compass flare. Risky poetic texture heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
