<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's embodied transformation—"knuckles knotting, skin roughening into barklike whorls"—reveals character under pressure with felt cost, earning his endurance. Interiority concrete via soil-tasting and muttering to hedges. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from neglect to revival, culminating in CR closure—"He felt the maze answer him, blooming and withering in time with his slowing pulse"—with conceptual cost of personal vs. measured luck undeniable. Orientation anchored early in maze between towers. One tightening via hedges "turning toward him" suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maze as micro-setting constrains choices (gaps torn by children) and charges final image via marble mirror curving "like a question mark slowly learning to become a sentence." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: hedges leaning, soil tasting. Evolves causally with his tending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (personal tending vs. quantified luck) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as hands transform but visitors return, forcing endurance with visible cost. Marble-rolling evenings test commitment. No agency-driven reversal needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of measured luck's limits emerges organically via particulars like polished marbles and muttered pact; final image offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing. Marble as returning image shifts from "dulled like eyes" to warped reflection charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: luck via "how the hedges leaned" and soil taste. Rhythmic control modulates from pragmatic ("wisely pragmatic, chose pruning shears") to lyric peak. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines multi-task (e.g., "hedges slumped like tired bureaucrats" advances setting/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("tiny storms caught in glass") purposeful, not muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantifiable luck and tended garden transforms tropes; marble Luck Pool and physical mirroring feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, charging CR.</comment>
