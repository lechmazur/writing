<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eve's contradictory impulses—hating half-truths yet tempted by them—act simultaneously in her flat-toned accusation and hungry reach for the ampoule; dealer's borrowed kindness reveals through copper arcs and shrug. Final endurance of subsumed certainties earned by prior static glitches and job pressure, with embodied cost in layered alien emotions. No safety-hedging; flaws drive her to the grotto.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of static, scents, and shelved moods builds to CR closure where "patterns assemble" reconfigures her verdicts, cost legible in "cool absence where true pain should have burned." Single scene anchored by first line's grotto; no orientation debt. One tightening via ampoule suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Amber walls and resin light constrain progression deeper, charging final storm of feelings; blotter petal as micro-setting enables transformation. Sensory hierarchy (static tastes, copper rain) biases via Eve's auditor lens, integrated into steps and palm-press. Grotto evolves from humming heart to dimmed trap, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fuse insight/empathy) signaled in opening unreliability, tightens texturally via layered emotions narrowing her static chaos into legible patterns. Agency in accepting blotter forecloses certainties; cost unmistakable in "tides wash close enough." One deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Half-truths emerge as scaffolds through dealer's shrug and final "glimmered... vantage," reweighting her granite-verdict premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like bitten-glass pride contradicting weak-tea hope; invites ambiguity on authenticity's authoritarian thinness. Final image answers fusion question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Close-third perceptual signature (static halos, tasting terrors) stable, biased to auditor precision; diction/rhythm modulates from syrupy sorrow to silver roots under transformation pressure. Dialogue subtext-laden ("half truths spend easier"), goal-driven. No head-hopping; elision of job details paid in clarity gain.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "static crawled... whispered feelings not mine" advances stakes/character); rhythm varies, read-aloud ear strong. Figurative density in transformation beat ("soft storm... silver roots") borders overwrite but pattern-taught from opening hum, pays in closure image—no muddle. Minor synonym churn in "half truths" echoes contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory auditor, copper-wired dealer, and bottled moods transforms emotion-trade trope; risk in lyric density heightens textural stakes without obscurity. Final "scaffolds to climb" turn inevitable from wired wrists and glitch motif. No template echoes; lived-in grotto anchors originality.</comment>
