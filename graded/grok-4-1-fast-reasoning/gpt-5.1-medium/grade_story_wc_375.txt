<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied grief (tears blurring lines) and contradictory impulses (vow vs. drawing eyes) earning the final renunciation; mnemonically gifted trait enables precise recall driving the climax choice with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to on-page CR in "inescapable callings do not end... stop corroding you," reconfiguring suppression with emotional cost legible in tears and rehung portrait; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystals as micro-setting constrain and charge closure by reflecting "twin lanterns where her irises should be" and paling with "auroral sorrow," mirroring internal shift; sensory selection purposeful and POV-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete vs. suppress portrait) signaled early, tightens via agency in drawing eyes amid tears, foreclosing vow with on-page cost under Accumulative lens; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inescapable callings emerges organically from particulars like lock incantation and unfinished gaze, resonating in final realization without statement; reweights premise via charged image of rehung portraits.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (faces in everything, charcoal dust); rhythmic prose modulates to compression at peak ("charcoal rasps over paper"); no head-hopping, elisions purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax and integrated sensory images; no loops/artifacts, metaphors consistent ("frozen fireworks") without muddle, even in peak tears-blurring beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mnemonic grief, broken lock as freedom symbol, and cave alchemy transforms artist suppression trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes to inevitable CR.</comment>
