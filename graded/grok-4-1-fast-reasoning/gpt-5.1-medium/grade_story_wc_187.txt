<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like pausing midstroke to watch shadows, reveal contradictory nostalgia driving faster work. Final residue of self in memories earns mutual sculpting with felt cost. No slips in single-POV coherence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from crystals to shadows to balcony realization as Charged Poise RR with conceptual cost in "city would dissolve into polite strangers" echoed in residue. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via abrupt shadow shifts narrows priorities. Closure image reconfigures identity premise undeniably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via stormlight-sharpened shadows dictating transcription order, charging final balcony chill. Sensory hierarchy (whispers, hums, thunder) POV-biased to memories; micro-objects like quills and tongs integrate tactilely. Final hush quiets forecourt, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve collective identity) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via shadow lengths shortening, forcing faster choices with chest-tightening cost of "future absence." Agency in prioritizing fading memories forecloses paths. Legible price in potential Thursday songs lost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal sculpting emerges organically from quill work and residue realization, reweighting premise without statement. Final image ("deepening hush turned inward") offers non-literal resonance on mutual memory with oblique social cost. Particulars like cinnamon stalls ground complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (shadows before carvings, preemptive ache). Lyrical diction and rhythm modulate from thunderous energy to hushed poise, taught early. No head-hopping or withholding; compression purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines like "summer-quill... held heat from days no one quite remembered" layer world/atmosphere/action. Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative pattern (hush, shadows, heartbeats) taught early, coherent in peaks without muddle. Minor density density in mid-beats doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-archiving world with quill/crystal mechanics transforms trope into inevitable mutual identity premise. Bold lyric risk in shadow-timekeeping heightens stakes; final reconfiguration feels earned from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
