<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied perception ("hands slick with rust," "vibrated in my ribs") and micro-choices under pressure, culminating in earned renunciation of escape; contradictory impulses peak in "I could walk away... Instead," with visible cost of binding to unfinished work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as echo density layers (tremor → chorus → resonance), delivering Charged Poise closure in final mapping act with conceptual cost of inherited doom; orientation anchored early, one tightening via building's "attention" reconfigures stakes without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration ("wet stone and forgotten ink," ivy choking door) constrains choices (prying blistered door) and charges final ear-to-brick image; micro-setting (passage/fireplace) mirrors internal shift without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (walls' dreams) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening (diaries → kinship → expectation), forcing agency in humming/read-aloud that narrows to stay-or-leave trade-off; cost legible in "questions that refused to fade," charging closure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Legacy emerges organically from particulars (Mara's notes, film child), reweighted in final "conscious node" image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to inheritance question via refusal of silence, embracing ambiguity of doomed work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hearing layers... like palimpsests") and rhythmic modulation under stress sustain single POV stability; lyrical compression taught early, paid off in closure without leakage or generic diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("I set my recorder... hummed... returning sound carried"), varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative layering ("syllables... spider silk") coherent and purposeful, undulled even in peak chorus beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo-mapping premise transformed via climate-ruined world and dreaming walls, risking lyric accrual that heightens stakes; "walls themselves turning toward me" turn inevitable from particulars, no derivative hedging.</comment>
