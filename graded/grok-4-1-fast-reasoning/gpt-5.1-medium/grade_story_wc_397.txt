<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied vibrations feeding "up my arm into my chest"; contradictory death-wish vs. life's hesitation impulses act on boat, earning renunciation with cost of foreclosed ending. Micro-choices like tapping parasol reveal values under volunteer pressure. Final realization integrates post-accident flaw without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sounds/textures builds to boat CR (vibration as "not the sound of death, but of everything choosing"), reweighting premise with cost of undecided life path. Orientation anchored by ~100 words; mosaic shards taught early via reflective week, legible transitions, coherent closure. One tightening via Runa's key to boat seals payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Parasol tip as micro-setting constrains final choice (touches water, yields revelation) and charges closure image; ice floes ("groaning," "kissed and parted") mirror internal states tactilely, evolve with meltwater/storm debris. Sensory hierarchy (sounds over sights) biases via POV quest. No white-room; spatial choreography clear pier/harbor/boat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn ending's sound to justify death) signaled early, deepens via boat agency under Accumulative lens: vibration forces stance crystallization, foreclosing suicide with legible cost in "spaciousness open, a crease like a fold in patience." One reversal narrows to living path; persistent ice constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (endings as ongoing choices) emerges organically from particulars like ice "nudging" and parasol vibrations, reweighted in final image without moralizing. Subtext in Runa's nod implies counter-reading of forecasts; resonance inextricable from arc, lingering ambiguity on path "back toward living."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in textural diction ("fragile, anticipatory texture," "breathing fog"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in boat creak/drip. Stable first-person focalization; purposeful compression of volunteering shard pays off in rehearsal motif. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (Runa's "trawling the edges of themselves").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "gloves slick with meltwater and faint oil" advances action/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent/patterned ("shattered porcelain," "slow, indecisive continents") without muddle in peak boat beat. Propulsion peaks in vibration crescendo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: euthanasia tourism via ice-sound quest transforms tropes through parasol/accident particulars; bold Accumulative mosaic risks lyricism but heightens stakes in vibration payoff. Non-obvious moral calculus (death as mishearing life's pause) feels inevitable hindsight. No derivative echoes.</comment>
