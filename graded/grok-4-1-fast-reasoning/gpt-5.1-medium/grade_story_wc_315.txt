<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in hesitation ("anger flare...but watcher never points") and muscle memory overriding thought compels filing choice with burden cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from static hitch to message unfolding; Charged Poise closure in "filed the report...data streaked downward" with cost of unseen preservation legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Arbor's swaying branches constrain perch awareness and steady in approval at closure, charging final image; sensory details (static fizz, cloud wounds) selectively bias POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve trust) signaled early tightens via message recognition narrowing options; agency in filing forecloses betrayal path under Accumulative lens with felt cost of quiet endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of fragile trust emerges organically; final "revision of its stories" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting unseen burden without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with perceptual signature (sky as static/patterns); rhythmic prose modulates from anticipatory hush to decisive exhale, compression purposeful under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm; figurative density peaks slightly in decoding ("promise bent around its lie") risks minor overload but coheres without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh sky-sifting premise transforms watcher trope through muscular pattern-seeking; risk-taking in lyric world logic heightens stakes, inevitable in trust's "soundless echo."</comment>
