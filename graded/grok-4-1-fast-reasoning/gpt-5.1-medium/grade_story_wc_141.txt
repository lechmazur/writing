<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via "sour kernel" question and embodied shame "bloom like slow rust"; contradictory impulses in myth-busting vs. acceptance earned through resonant memories. Final endurance of unanswered questions forecloses tidy dismantling with bittersweet cost. Minor epiphany directness doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hums build density from shell to cello to reimagined pasts, culminating in CR closure "those lines formed no letters, yet she read them as permission" with conceptual cost of perpetual questioning. Orientation anchored early (observatory/cliff/sea). Single scene coherent, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurring shell/cello constrain choices (touch/lift/place) and charge final resonance; sensory hums/dust spirals/shavings filter through Tamsin's priorities. Atmosphere mirrors internal shift from failure to "gloomy cheerfulness." Cliff/observatory subtly pressure mood without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode riddle via myths) signaled early, deepens via hum-reimagined conversations narrowing to acceptance; agency in touches/listening forecloses proof-seeking. Cost felt in "shame bloom like slow rust" and final unanswered path. Accumulative cadence reweights without reversal excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of myths as "negative space of longing" emerges organically from reimagined scenes; final shell-cello lines offer non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise. No moralizing; ambiguity in "rehearsal" lingers with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in mythic filters ("pages turning around her"); rhythmic syntax modulates from muttering notes to shivering tones under pressure. No dialogue; diction character-specific without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "shell answered with brighter, shivering tone"); rhythm varies, no loops/artifacts/muddled metaphors in peak resonance beats. Propulsion aligns with hum intensification to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of humming artifacts reimagining pasts transforms myth-busting into textured riddle; risk in lyric resonance heightens stakes via irreplaceable shell-cello premise. No derivative echoes; inevitable hindsight in "invisible, pulsing diagram."</comment>
