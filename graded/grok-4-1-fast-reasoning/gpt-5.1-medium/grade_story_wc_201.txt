<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority via trauma responses (e.g., "muscles anticipating a blow"); contradictory impulses peak in trembling knees before earned preparatory brace and surrender. Final choice compellingly rooted in survivor traits, foreclosing unquantified self with visible cost. No diagnostic speak flattens crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from waking flashes to resonant reconfiguration (RR/Charged Poise) in frame-step with conceptual cost ("pain began to factor"). One continuous scene, orientation anchored early (~50 words), no debt. Lens taught and closure legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest as interface constrains choices (e.g., light equations on scars guide to clearing) and charges final flare. Body micro-setting (joints, scars) mirrors internals tactilely. Sensory hierarchy urgent, POV-biased; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mercy's math vs. trauma surrender) signaled early, accumulates via flashes/voice to agency-driven tightening (step into frame forecloses refusal). Cost unmistakable in straps' familiarity and spine brace reconfiguration under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of quantified mercy emerges via trauma geometry, reweighted non-literally in final factoring without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable; resonant ambiguity in "obscene and exquisite" proposition lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (trauma-biased noticing: "heart stutters the way other people read diaries"); rhythmic modulation under stress, stable first-person. Voice modulated direct address integrates seamlessly as nerve-pathway speech.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm; figurative pattern (geometric light/trauma) taught early, coherent payoff at closure without muddle. No loops, scaffolds, or drift; peak beats clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of torture-survivor proprioception and quantum-forest penance transforms tropes organically. Bold premise/voice cohere; final frame-image inevitable hindsight risk heightens stakes.</comment>
