<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied intrigue overriding repulsion at the corpse flower seed; receptive trait drives micro-choices like incorporating players' ideas into designs and yielding to the seed's visions. Final realization earned via planting's cost (cold fingers, earth inhaling). Contradictory impulses act in scene, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from envelope to brook-planting, culminating in CR closure where visionary images reweight premise ("rooms not yet built... entrance instead") with conceptual cost (driving away casuals legible in "reek would drive away"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene/shard coherent. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (brook's riffle, mud's ash-smell) constrain choice (wading to coordinates) and charge final image (mill groans post-planting). POV bias filters (Elias notices puzzle-like loops in reeds/beams). 9+ gate met via micro-setting (wet soil) enabling seed's inhale. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (innovation space) signaled early, tightens via deepening (seed as blueprint narrows to underground orthogonal path). Agency in planting forecloses caution with felt cost (sharp cold, shifting beams). Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens but lacks one micro-turn reversal, slightly softening peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of below-remaking curiosity emerges organically from planting and visions; final image ("leave entangled in whatever dreamed beneath") offers resonant CR answer reweighting comfort vs strangeness without moral. Particulars (seed's iron smell, impossible geometries) drive earned insight; ambiguity lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with distinct perceptual signature (puzzle analogies: "clues arranged in loops... defensive walls"). Rhythmic control modulates from calm ("thoughts could flow unbroken") to charged hush; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "slit the envelope... paper parting with a sigh"); rhythm varies, read-aloud ear strong. Minor overwriting density in opening beat's metaphors ("dormant constellations," "storm-born silence") borders pattern without obscuring closure, docking from 9-band. Zero loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: corpse seed as architectural blueprint transforms escape room trope into underground remaking, inevitable via receptive trait and orthogonal method. Risky lyric Accumulative builds to CR without gimmick; no derivative echoes, full premise commitment.</comment>
