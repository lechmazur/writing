<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Daniel's trait of hearing unspoken words roots motivation consistently, intensifying through chess metaphors and recruitment; micro-choices like phoning shop owners reveal values under pressure. Interiority concrete and embodied via sensory "tug of doubt." Final rebellion earned without unmotivated epiphany; Milo applies secondary pressure cleanly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sensed fears to synchronized displays, culminating in CR via "softer now, leaflike" words and vote shift with conceptual cost of surrendered futures reweighted. Mosaic shards legible with early quiet pattern; orientation anchored by ~100 words in school/library routine. Closure cost legible in "collective second thought taking root."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Grotto's iron-veined stones constrain via magnetic pull on compass, charging realizations; library mist and starlight sharpen perceptual hierarchy. Sensory selection urgent (fog sharpens lights) and POV-biased toward silences. Spatial choreography coherent across town map to balcony view; recurring mist/quiet evolves with fog on vote night.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (halt parking via second thoughts) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through recruitment doubts to display synchronization narrowing options. Agency in humble coordination forecloses resignation path; council vote crystallizes with felt cost in faltered talks. One decisive deepening suffices under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of pauses/hesitations emerges from leaf-crading image shifting to window forests reweighting council resolve; final grotto reconfigures premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and pawn shadow carries ambiguity of quiet power. Resonance from particulars like shopkeeper resignations, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "hearing unspoken words" before they form, modulating rhythm from hushed prose to sharper fog-lit climax. POV stable single focalizer; Milo's whisper natural/subtextual. Compression purposeful in elided recruitments, paid off in collective tide image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short peaks ("Conversations faltered") amid longer meditative flows; density high as images multi-task (pawn shadow evokes closure). Minor paraphrase loops in "quiet" variants ("amplified quiet," "hush") purposeful but templated (-0.4); no muddle in closure leaf/forest reprise.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess-board town map into window rebellion transforms environmental activism trope via invisible pauses. Balcony-knit forest feels inevitable from early map beat; risk in mosaic quietness heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
