<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied nostalgia ("driftwood pulled from a receding tide") and contradictory impulses (repair vs. borrowed breath) act in scene; final repairs earn change with visible cost (chapped fingers, stinging eyes).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: prophecies build density to mirror repairs; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration in thawing library with felt cost ("driftwood nostalgia for lives I had never lived"). Orientation anchors early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen library and gears constrain choices (needs scraps first, frost leans in); recurring ice/feathers charge final thaw image, mirroring internal repair.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn repair rhythm) signaled early, tightens via prophecies-to-mirrors; agency in gear alignments forecloses regrets with legible physical/emotional cost, though single deepening limits peak band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of quiet mending emerges organically from gears unlocking regrets; final thaw reweights repair motif with non-literal resonance, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("silence layered like dust"); rhythmic modulation under pressure, stable first-person with purposeful lyric compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm passes read-aloud; purposeful metaphors (gears as "rescued stars") integrate without muddle, minor density in mirror sequence ("chords of motion") avoids artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith in mirror-memories transforms tropes; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes, inevitable thaw from particulars.</comment>
