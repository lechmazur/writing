<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in dread knot and fear clutching chest act simultaneously during summoning, compelling the metamorphosis choice with visible unmaking cost; interiority particular to beast whisperer noticing non-flesh beasts. Final grove transformation earned by prior spice ritual and beast trust, foreclosing human form.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as scent density and beast encirclement build to RR closure in "we learn to inhabit them together"; orientation anchored early in orchard walk. On-page cost legible in "my own unmaking" and branch-fingered metamorphosis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cauldron tree hollow and spice motes constrain ritual choices, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (scent over sight) reflects urgency and POV bias toward ethereal beasts. Moonlight recurs to mirror internal steady pulse amid transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforge bond) signaled early, escalates via alchemy-triggered metamorphosis narrowing human options under Accumulative lens; agency in naming her despite dread forces trade-off. Cost unmistakable in beasts dissolving into "widening wooden ribs."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of bonds transcending death emerges organically via spice bridge and lifetime visions, reweighting premise in final "cosmic intimacy" without moralizing. Orchard lifetimes image offers resonant answer to distance-of-death question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature (beasts as "wind-currents, tremors in roots") stable, with rhythmic modulation under stress; her sparse dialogue ("You should not have come") carries subtext and advances intimacy. Patterned elision of backstory taught early via fortune pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "air thickens, fragrant with cardamom..."); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or scaffolds. Minor metaphor density in peak ("moonlight pours like clear milk") coherent and pattern-taught, enhancing alchemy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of beast-summoning necromancy into tree-grove intimacy post-phoenix transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric metamorphosis heightens stakes. Final ember-seeds inevitable from ash setup, no derivative echoes.</comment>
