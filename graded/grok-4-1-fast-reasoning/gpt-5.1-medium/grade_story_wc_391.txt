<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in embodied impatience ("gnawed at my ribs") clashing with slow tasks, earning the viaduct realization and final renunciation of haste with personal cost in family images.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density through tasks to viaduct peak, landing Charged Poise/CR closure in "direction could change without haste," with legible emotional cost in "slow lightning" tingling fingers and prior impatience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen lake and viaduct basin anchor vividly, constraining tasks ("stand still while the wind tried to move me") and charging the humming current as final image reconfigures haste.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sculpting patience tightens accumulatively via "pointless" tasks to viaduct deepening that narrows hasty options, with agency in endurance and cost felt in "patient revolution" visions altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Patient revolution emerges organically from viaduct echoes of "small thing slower," offering resonant non-literal answer in final shore walk that reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyric first-person voice with perceptual signature ("charts were made of feelings as much as of lines") modulates purposefully at viaduct intensity; sparse dialogue carries subtext distinguishing Orren.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic variety propel to closure ("slow lightning" image), but figurative layering occasionally thickens mid-buildup ("bow neither drawn nor slack") without obscuring peak clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Magnetic viaduct storing storm charge for "patient revolution" synthesizes fresh angle on haste, transforming tropes through grounded, inevitable viaduct climax.</comment>
