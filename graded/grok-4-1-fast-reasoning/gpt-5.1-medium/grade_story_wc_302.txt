<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (dread/delight prickling ribs) act simultaneously in testing coughs and signing; final renunciation of documentation earned by prior silence tests with felt cost of ink vanishing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from mist corridors to silence delays; CR closure in destroying resignation letter reconfigures mapping pursuit with conceptual cost of unresolved gifts, legible in single-sentence card.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mist and silence constrain choices (finger-writing fades, coughs test delays) and charge final image (ink fogging under lantern book); recurring fog evolves tactilely, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (document unspoken library) deepens accumulatively via delay mapping, forcing renunciation; cost unmistakable in resigning letter's destruction foreclosing safe Institute path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of restraint as mercy emerges organically from alcoves of unsaid invitations; final card's single sentence offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting cowardice as gift without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (noticing hesitation pockets, shadow shifts); rhythmic prose modulates from exuberant entry to reverent hush, dialogue subtextual in password exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., watch's "seesaw" advances timing rule and character); varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle in peak silence tests.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of impossible library as silence delays transforms discovery trope; risk-taking in unfolding cipher pattern heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via letter destruction.</comment>
