<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority shines in contradictory impulses like playful lies turning prophetic, compelling the rewrite choice with earned cost in complicity; Parker applies sharp secondary pressure without stealing focus. Minor reflective summaries slightly dilute embodied tension pre-climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from prophetic slips to lighthouse rewrite; Charged Poise closure lands on-page in "island seemed to hold its breath, then exhale into a different, sharper cadence" with felt reconfiguration cost. Orientation anchored early; one meaningful tightening via Parker's intrusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains climax via "storm steps" and "rotating lens groaned," charging final beam sweep; selective sensory details like "dust floated in columns of stray light" mirror internal shift without overt symbolism. Lighthouse micro-setting evolves to drive choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transposing fate via fortunes tightens accumulatively through prophetic examples and Parker's plea, narrowing to rewrite agency; cost legible in "uneasy but complicit" shift, charging poise. Minor abstractness in early stakes slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of subtle orchestration emerges organically from light patterns and fortunes, resonating in final "lighthouse was whispering" without moralizing; reweights open secrets via concrete prophetic accidents.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in musical metaphors ("sheet music," "weary melody") biases noticing toward flow and light; dialogue subtextual ("just write what the dough tells me") advances under pressure. Stable first-person with rhythmic modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in short, image-packed sentences during rewrite; purposeful "directing flow" motif avoids loops. Minor paraphrase in prophetic examples ("one Tuesday... another time") dulls one mid-beat slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-spy-lighthouse transforms Cold War tropes into prophetic subtlety; risk in musical conceit heightens stakes, inevitable in "nudging the notes" climax.</comment>
