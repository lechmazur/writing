<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ilan's motivation roots in brother's loss and mask-restoring craft, with contradictory hesitation at the final knot compelling the earned release; embodied fear in "hands steady despite the chill" grounds internal conflict without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as knot-unraveling densifies voices and hush toward CR closure at "the name spilled... tasting of brine," with legible cost in personal echo of brother's absence; orientation anchors immediately in sanctuary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary's refracting starlight constrains spirits' gathering and sharpens final hush, charging closure image; sensory hush and salt integrate via Ilan's biased notice, mirroring internal restoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to ground captain via net escalates accumulatively through knot-released voices tightening to final star-knot pressure; agency in unraveling forecloses unrest with felt cost in softened spirits and Ilan's promise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of restoration via release emerges organically from masks to net-name, resonating in final "grounded stillness" reweighting silence without moralizing; ambiguity in name's cost lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward quivers and hushes; sparse dialogue natural ("I will keep it..."), subtext-laden, advancing promise without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied syntax and motif echoes like "exhume," but dense figuratives ("light bent into patient planes") border overwriting in unraveling beat without obscuring closure; no loops dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mask-restorer to net-unraveler transforms grief tropes via net's knotted histories; risk in poetic hush accumulation heightens stakes organically toward name's conceptual cost.</question>
