<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and motivation in Elian's community graft desire, embodied in reed-sculptor hands and sympathetic gaze; Mira as crucible forces micro-choices toward shared sculpture vision. Minor slip in unembodied "luminescent ache" phrasing at closure pivot, but change earned via prior search causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wandering to arbor discovery ("Stay and scatter") as Charged Poise RR with felt cost in "tangled futures." Orientation anchored early (crater/orchard/Elian); one tightening via shared search suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Obsidian arbor as recurring micro-setting constrains discovery and charges final image ("slow heartbeat resonate up his arm"); sensory selection POV-biased (shadow-sketching, dust-grooves). Vivid integration elevates beyond vividness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (graft to community) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via search to arbor revelation narrowing solitary vs. woven futures; agency in spirals/etching touch, cost legible in "yearning that was not quite pain." No live option foreclosure slips into 8s.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of belonging as "root and rumor" emerges organically from tag-search to arbor webs; final "voices rose like tender graffiti" non-literal resonant answer reweighting isolation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (Siltghost tags on floodwalls/bark); dialogue subtextual ("Everyone who has ever felt unseen"), rhythmic prose modulates to hushed closure. Stable third-close, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "grooves held no pigment, yet a faint afterimage pulsed"); minor figurative density in high-pressure arbor beat ("hairline grooves traced... phosphorescent graffiti") borders overwrite but pattern-taught as lyric voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crystalline orchard/Siltghost surrealism transforms belonging tropes; arbor-tag discovery feels inevitable from marsh echoes, bold risk in textural accrual heightens stakes.</comment>
