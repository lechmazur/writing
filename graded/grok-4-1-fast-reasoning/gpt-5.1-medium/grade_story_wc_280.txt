<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcel's fractured selves show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in his glance around before agreeing; final renunciation of solo rehearsal earned by Lina's proposal and coin. Lina's synesthesia embodies motive through scent-traced paths and color-heard words. Distinct voices in ghost-light speech vs. her ascending scales.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from maze entry to orchard glow, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("let us try again") with felt cost of fraying timelines/theater loss. Orientation anchored early (Lina enters padlocked gate). Single scene, no shards/transitions needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synesthetic sensory hierarchy (citrus-green possibility, violet shards) filters through Lina's bias, constraining maze navigation by scent; orchard/fountain recur to frame coin and agreement, charging final image. Details evolve (brightens on coin lift). No white-room; spatial choreography clear (western arch to spirals).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save maze/theater) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via proposal narrowing Marcel's solo echoes to joint encore; agency in coin-touch and "with you," cost legible in rust-red words on gutting. Escalation coherent under lens, foreclosing isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of recaptured possibility emerges from coin-wheel turning prior fading posters/ghost hunger; final conducting hands reweight scattered nights without moralizing. Subtext in silence before "All right" invites ambiguity on success.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature (waves as brass/velvet, words as gusts) biases noticing; rhythmic compression in flickering costumes matches intensity. Stable third-limited (Lina focalizes entry/dialogue). Dialogue subtextual (ectoplasm autograph evades stakes).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory/prose jobs (e.g., "pale blue gust that smelled of sawdust"); rhythm varies, no loops/artifacts. Figurative synesthesia coherent, not muddled in peak ("conduct the orchard"). Minor density slip in timeline descriptions pre-peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: synesthesia + ghost timelines + tarot key transforms nostalgia into tactile magic; risk in fractured Marcel form heightens stakes, inevitable in coin-proposal hinge. No templates; premise commits to mystic rules.</comment>
