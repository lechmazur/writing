<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's molting trait drives contradictory impulses, shown when shrugging on "weary archivist" under patrol pressure, earning final resumption with relational cost to Lio's worry. Lio applies pressure as foil, ledger of selves grounding endurance. No unearned epiphanies; flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds to patrol intrusion as pattern break, yielding Charged Poise closure when tin is lifted and "fracture toward light" reopens, cost felt in "fingers shaking like the flame still burns." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene with reflective shards fits scope, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted library constrains: loose floorboard hides tin during beams, open roof drips to water "blooming resistance," charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (stars, glass crunch) reflects POV urgency; spatial choreography clear amid stacks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forge resistance) tightens via patrol reversal, narrowing to disguise/endurance; agency in hiding/resuming forecloses exposure with shaking-fingers cost. Escalation accumulates density under lens, options reweighted legible on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Blooming resistance emerges organically from tin poems and patrol evasion; final "reopen the fracture toward light" resonates as non-literal answer to anarchy's cost, reweighting molting via particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature (splintered hope, luminous fracture) modulates with pressure, stable without slippage; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual. Rhythmic diction reflects fractured mind, pattern-taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (books as "contraband birds"); varied rhythm propels, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure. Minor overwrite in reflective block ("molts personalities") risks density but voice-motivated; peak patrol beat clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: molting poet's tin press transforms anarchy tropes via lived resistance; risky lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight as patrol charges poise without gimmickry.</comment>
