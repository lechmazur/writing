<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied interiority excels in tremor and freeze responses tying past to present choices; final folding of photo earns renunciation of denial with cost to optimism. Minor diagnostic "somatic markers" label slightly abstracts peak embodiment without full dramatization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to Charged Poise closure in notebook listing and photo fold; orientation anchors early (Mariam, arboretum, post-trauma). Cost legible in "truths did not cancel each other," reweighting premise without decisive act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via drone-free safety and mirrors internal reach in "plants... leaned toward the empty air"; charges final image with absent lighthouse path cleared by "steadying feet." Sensory filter (salt fog, ocean roar) biases through trauma.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor realism-optimism) signaled early, tightens texturally in truth-list beat narrowing denial; agency in writing/renaming forecloses escape with felt cost of persistent ache. No reversal needed under lens; pressure coheres to pearl endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image shifts (henna hands to fig tracing, photo blur); final "pearl of stillness" reconfigures resilience non-literally with wreckage cost, embracing complexity sans moral. Resonant counter-reading in stubborn survival lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in biased noticing (gull shriek to shoulder seize); rhythmic lyricism modulates from memory intrusion to poised close without slippage. Voice distinct via idiomatic syntax reflecting quiet endurance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "waves chewed... grinding teeth" advances atmosphere/psychic state); varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor therapy-label scaffold in "somatic markers" slightly dulls one beat, but no loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms drone-trauma via arboretum/nature parallels (leaning plants, pearl grit); risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes without gimmick, inevitable in photo-fold hindsight. No derivative tropes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
