<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between clean-slate desire and dirty-past protection act in scene via torch use and wading choice; final empathy-kindling renunciation earned by trail-following causality with embodied throat-tightening cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as clue density (ads to ball to tunnel) tightens to cavern CR; final "images rushed me...accusing arms" reconfigures cleanse premise with conceptual cost of recovered sins.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake's "bruised turquoise light, pulsing gently" and "cold biting through my boots" constrain wade and charge CR final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative deepening from ball's "DO NOT HESITATE" to lake images driven by protagonist's journey agency; sin-recognition cost unmistakable in "brightening in nervous flares."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ripple echoes as "tiny pain...suspended here" offer resonant non-literal answer to erasure theme, reweighting prior cleanse critique without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "pigeons still limped through oil slicks" and post-cleanse "bare plate where history used to sit"; rhythmic control heightens revelation pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels from "hardened popcorn like a fossil" to "dripping slow sparks"; zero loops or muddled figures in peak lake beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Memory-reservoir lake synthesizes sci-fi cleanse and empathy loss originally; future-signed ball risk heightens stakes to CR without gimmickry.</comment>
