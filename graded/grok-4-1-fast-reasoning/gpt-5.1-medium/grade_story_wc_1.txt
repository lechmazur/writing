<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices like tracing the sun symbol reveal adaptive flaws under survival pressure, earning the final walk; contradictory caution ("circled the ruins like a moth who remembers") acts in scene. Minor epiphanic polish softens raw contradiction at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as frost patterns to ledger arrows accumulate to Charged Poise closure in walking the pass; orientation anchored early ("first night...canyon"); cost legible in "fear...anneal[ed]" and "old story like glass returning to sand."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Canyon ruins and frost patterns constrain choices (ledger held to sky mirrors frost) and charge final image of steps beyond blast; tactile glass/body integration ("fingers could almost hear") filters through artist's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of purpose amid sabotage tightens texturally via ledger-frost match narrowing to arrows/pass; agency in pressing strip forces trade-off (circling vs. pursuing); cost felt in adaptive pauses annealing fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of remaking from ruin emerges organically via glass/pause motifs reweighted in final steps; resonant non-literal answer in furnace "closing on the old story," embracing survival's oblique cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light admission, flame wounds) and rhythmic modulation under resonance sustain first-person stability; lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via purposeful metaphors, but figurative density in reflective beats ("stars trembled like glass," "black tongue of paper") borders overwriting without pattern break, slightly dulling peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glasswork survival with ledger-frost mapping transforms sabotage trope; risk-taking in resonance visions heightens stakes organically to inevitable canyon/pass reconfiguration.</comment>
