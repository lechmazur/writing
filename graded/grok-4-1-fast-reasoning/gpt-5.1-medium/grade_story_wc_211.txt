<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via ink-stained fingers and heart-knotted "buried"; micro-choices like stone placement reveal values. Maro applies pressure but lacks depth beyond mystery. Earned realization at prophecy pivot forecloses casual archiving with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shaving setup to memory merge and CR closure in "accidental prophecy" line, reweighting archive premise with nightmare clarity cost. Orientation anchored early in orchard/skyscraper. Single scene, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard constrains via no-machine immersion on river stone; fruit labels mirror oaths, branches "leaning inward" charge listening beat. Sensory selective (gravel whisper, wax curl). Final tightening evokes garden "tighten[ing]."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archive shaving) signaled early, deepens via prophecy hearing that changes knowledge/options under Accumulative lens. Agency in ear-to-wax immersion; conceptual cost legible in "nightmare" realization. Minor abstractness softens visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of emotional archiving as prophecy emerges via recording's "vast and cold" oaths vs. Lan's personal threads; final CR reweights without statement. Subtext in Maro's "not for you" silence. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (dead languages as "rings," buried knot). Prose rhythm modulates to "thinned" immersion; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("not for you"). No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; metaphors cohere (wax "ghost," groove "road"). Minor figurative density in garden leans but pattern-taught, no loops/artifacts dulling closure image. Propulsion peaks at prophecy clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: skyscraper orchard as oath archive transforms relic tropes; prophecy via emotion catalog inevitable from particulars. Risky lyric texture heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick.</comment>
