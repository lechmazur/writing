<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ira's calmly intuitive trait shines in tasting "silence... like fear wrapped in stubbornness," driving micro-choices like walking through mirrors; anomaly's shadow sync reveals refusal with embodied cost. Final lift of fragment earns change via prior causality. Contradictory impulses act in scene without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: visions densify pressure to Charged Poise closure where Ira reconstitutes accord "one by one... via glimpses in vintage store mirrors," with cost legible in easing shoulders and orchard's choice. Orientation anchored early in orchard/lighthouse; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mirrors and crystal constrain choices, charging final image; ice floes "shifted and sighed" ground selectively via Ira's boots/perception. Sensory hierarchy reflects intuitive POV; vintage shop evolves with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert war via anomaly accord) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through mirror futures narrowing to joint governance; agency in proposing "recognize it as a deciding voice" forecloses paths with orchard-spoil cost felt on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of remapping "fear onto vision" emerges via mirror threads ("anger spun into policy"), resonant in final reconstitution reweighting broken crystal/treaty without moralizing. Particulars like shadow's lean avoid binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("silence tasted like fear"); dialogue subtextual ("map empathy onto action"), distinct voices (her rawness vs. his soft). Rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (mirrors/light); varied rhythm propels without loops. Minor metaphor density in visions serves lens, no scaffold obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of intuitive peacekeeper remaking accords literally via mirrors transforms negotiation trope; risk in mirror discipline taken boldly, inevitable in hindsight at "reconstitute the accord into something the orchard chose."</comment>
