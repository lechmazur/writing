<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Uncertain alchemist's doubt embodies in shaking hands nearly dropping charm and tracing pockmarks under acid pressure, driving micro-choice to strap in; contradictory fear of inventing meaning acts simultaneously with pursuit, earning realization without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descent accumulates sensory density to pockmark flare and fracture, yielding CR closure in narration etching sigils that repair glass with cost (voice shredding, no survival guarantee).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass lung and acid sea constrain descent choice, statue pockmarks as recurring object charge final lattice vision mirroring kintsugi repair.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to divine future via statue tightens in lung as vapors thin and fracture crawls, forcing agency in narration that repairs crack but crystallizes survival cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of conjuring meaning from ruin emerges via glowing cracks in vision and etched sigils turning fracture to seam, reweighting prevention to acceptance in final workshop-as-page image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of alchemical lyricism (e.g., "smell etched cauterized paths"); rhythm compresses tightly in lung peak without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but minor overwrite in repeated motifs like "quilts memories" risks muddle before peak lung clarity; no loops dull closure repair image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acid-sea alchemy and pockmark-script divination transforms ruin tropes into kintsugi closure, risking lyric density for charged resonance.</comment>
