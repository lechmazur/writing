<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysander's mournfully eager grief embodied in concrete micro-choices like lining blowers crescent-style and half-singing with cracking voice; internal contradiction peaks in "proof that something fragile has cracked open," earning final renunciation of completion. Contradictory impulses act in scene (eager strike vs. mournful rehearsal history), with visible cost in ongoing work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from clatter/setup to roar/maceration to surge blooming phantom laughter, tightening via cadence shift; Charged Poise closure in "work...never be finished" with conceptual cost legible in final tunnel silence holding smile. Orientation anchored early (descent, Mara's death context); no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel constrains choices (snouts to brick for feedback, shakes mildew) and charges final image (air holds smile shape); sensory hierarchy sound-dominant (footsteps twice, bruised resonance), filtered via Lysander's grief bias. Micro-setting (brick, moisture) mirrors internal stir without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore laughter) signaled early, escalates via density surge splitting roar into pockets threading vents; agency in wrist-jerk tempo narrows options, cost felt in upstairs draft forcing parental laughs then dropped-back proof. Protagonist endurance forecloses full restoration path under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of coaxing unspoken (swallowed jokes blooming as phantoms) emerges organically, final image reweights via fragile crack-open vs. endless tending without moral; resonance from particulars like half-laugh chord, charged by mold's unreadable stories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature fuses sound/memory (footsteps arrive twice "in sound and once in memory"); rhythmic control modulates with intensity (short gasps to roars), stable third-close POV with synesthetic diction taught early. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density (lines multi-job: advance sound build + embody grief); metaphors consistent/pattern-taught (orchestra progression to frayed film), no loops/churn/synonyms; minor figurative density in peak conduct beat purposeful for resonance payoff. Propulsion clear, read-aloud varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bold synthesis of leaf-blower orchestra transforms grief tropes via tunnel acoustics into laughter phantom; risk in "maestro at the end of the world" heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from unspoken tending premise. Non-obvious angle on restoration feels singular.</comment>
