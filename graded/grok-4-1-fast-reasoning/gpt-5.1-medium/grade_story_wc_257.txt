<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ela's motivation to refract grief into blooming pieces is embodied in origami circuits navigating failure dates, with contradictory impulses in "unbearable" work yielding earned change; Riv applies gentle pressure without dominating. Final shift from urn pendants to glass seeds confronts flaws with cost. 9+ test met: impulses act in circuits, closure choice earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from workbench to meteor shower pattern break, reweighting stake via illuminated failures. Closure as CR: "rock bottom was only a temporary floor" with conceptual cost of prior paths foreclosed, legible in final glow image. Orientation anchored early; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Observatory ribs and central shaft constrain origami circuits, charging final "scars of the observatory's metal" image; sensory light/ash filtered through Ela's grief bias. Micro-setting (vellum, birds) evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbols. 9+ test: recurring dome/lens constrains choices, charges end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teach withering to bloom) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via circuits to shower tightening that crystallizes stance; agency in leaving figures forces trade-off with past dates. Cost felt in "chain of small awakenings." Minor abstractness in initial promise slightly mutes mid-pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief-lens refracting intention emerges via particulars (onyx seeds to glass arcs); final shower image offers non-literal answer, reweighting withering to blooming without moralizing. Resonance from origami failures, no tidy binary. 9+ test: resonant reconfiguration reweights premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in light-folding diction ("loom where unspoken wants were woven"); third-limited stable, modulates rhythmically to charged shower climax. Riv's sparse dialogue subtextual, idiom distinct. No head-hopping; compression taught early, paid in closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (slow stitching to billowing curtains), high density in "cascading curtains of intention"; minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but serves accumulative texture without muddle. No loops; propulsion clear to final sketching. Slight scaffold in repetitive light motifs nudges from 9.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief jewelry, intention spectrometer, ash-origami circuits transforms mourning tropes; meteor shower as impossible ephemeris payoff risks boldly, inevitable in hindsight. No derivatives; premise commits fully to artificial/ruins glow.</comment>
