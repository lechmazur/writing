<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poet's motivation to map scars intensifies through embodied absence in throat and culminates in earned CR at telescope; contradictory forgiveness renunciation feels causal from prior silencing. Astronomer applies precise pressure via data revelation. Voice distinction shines in dialogue like "poems were isobars."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to timer wind-up to telescope CR, reweighting scars premise with conceptual cost in final auroral image. Orientation anchored by ~50 words at threshold. Single scene causality intact, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Observatory dome slit and storm constrain viewing choice, charging final bruise-map image; sensory hierarchy (chemical tang, hot metal, wind poem) reflects poet's priorities. Micro-setting (timer, telescope) evolves causally with thunder buoying air. No white-room; spatial choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scar cartography) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via timer discipline and sky vigil to vision agency; cost legible in patient grief pulsing. One deepening suffices under lens. No abstract stakes; pressure coheres to foreclosed pretense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of sky-remembered silencing emerges organically from ionosphere bruise and detectors spiking banned verses, resonant CR reweights without moral in final rarefied air. Subtext in "vigil in pause" lingers ambiguously. No sermonizing; complexity in forgiving nothing yet living.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature poetic (lightning as handwriting); dialogue subtextual, goal-driven ("show me"). Rhythm modulates to charged poise at eyepiece. No head-hopping; diction fits censored poet's idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "lightning stitched... temporary handwriting" advances atmosphere/plot). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; rhythm varies, propels to closure. Minor overwriting risk in bruise motifs offset by pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: censorship scars as ionospheric vigil transforms tropes organically; risk in sky-altar premise heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via detector spikes. No templates; bold auroral wounds image memorable.</comment>
