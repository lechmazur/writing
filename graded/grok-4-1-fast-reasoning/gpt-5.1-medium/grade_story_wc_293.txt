<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the fiddler's ache and luminous disbelief driving the micro-choice to tuck the flake and play faster, earning the reunion with felt cost in fraying bow and buried gratitude. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding epiphanies. Flawless under pressure at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via song layers to flake shattering (pattern break) and hitchhiker return (RR/Charged Poise), reconfiguring possibilities with cost in "impossibly heavy" choice legible at "the flake shatters into invisible dust." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent. Closure cost undeniable in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Scaffold wrap and violin constrain choices, charging final image where wrap settles as "every possible road collapsing." Sensory details (gravel crunch, dust swirl) filtered through fiddler's observant bias, evolve causally. Micro-setting (flake on bridge) pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free hitchhiker from frames) signaled early, escalates via agency in recount-song tightening options ("smear one merciful timeline"), cost visible in fraying bow and "choice feels impossibly heavy." Lens-coherent deepening forces stance crystallization at shattering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sculpting possibility emerges organically via flake's amnesty frames reweighted by song, answered non-literally in collapsing roads. Resonance from particulars avoids moralizing; final image recharges prior motifs with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dynamically observant") biases noticing flake and scaffold; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity (short harmonic note). Stable single POV; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm, but figurative piling ("headlights crawl like cautious fireflies," "dust drifts... like uncommitted snow") borders overwriting in peak song beat without obscuring cause/effect. No loops or scaffolds; clarity holds at shattering.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Pixelated amnesty and glass flake synthesize fresh premise organically, transforming hitchhiker trope via musical causality. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes; inevitable in hindsight from observant gift/curse.</comment>
