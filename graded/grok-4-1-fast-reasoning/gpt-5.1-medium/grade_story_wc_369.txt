<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Milo's motivation roots deeply in listening habits and tree-talking, culminating in the earned shift to recording tree memories with ledger cost. Contradictory impulses surface subtly when he ignores protocol for the sextant. Interiority shines in "wondering hardened into his only real wish," tying traits to closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pin drop initiates density build through sextant healing and tree sighting to CR closure in dawn ledger. On-page cost legible in life divergence "at the moment a pin is heard." Orientation anchors early in Corridor Theta; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stormlit details constrain via leaks/cracks spotted easily and moonlight healing on roof pots. Rooftop trees charge final image among pots with ledger. Sensory filter (drips, drafts, shivering leaves) POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tree witnesses) signaled early, tightens texturally at tree sighting revealing "labyrinthal cross section of seasons." Agency in lifting/sighting forecloses sweeping routine. Cost felt in cumulative sorrow logged toward forgiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quantified sorrow emerges organically via sextant/tree diagram, reweighting memories as "cumulative, the way dust gathers." Final ledger image answers witnessing premise non-literally with forgiveness bend. No moralizing; ambiguity in sorrow's legibility lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "leaking echo told him where the maze was tired"; rhythmic control modulates from storm hush to dawn hum. Stable close-third POV biases to maintenance/tree attunement. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "wind tore at his coat and flung spray" embeds action. Varied rhythm, no loops; metaphors cohere (e.g., "moonlight pooled like spilt milk") without muddle in peak revelation. Zero scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sorrow-measuring sextant revives to map tree-memory labyrinths, transforming maintenance trope. Risk in mundane miracle tone pays off at "everyday mercy" healing. Inevitable hindsight from pin-to-ledger arc.</comment>
