<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Negotiator's contradictory impulses peak embodied in "embarrassed with its compromise" yet offers terms for civilians, earning the signing choice with felt internal cost; distinct voices in sparse dialogue; general and envoy apply pressure through scars/threads without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ritual density to Charged Poise closure in signing amid "justice bartered for survivable disappointment," with conceptual cost legible in final sky image; orientation anchored early in terrace/midsummer; single scene seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details like "crushed mint, dust" and bowls constrain ritual choices; terrace/ moon charges final "flawed beauty" image; POV-filtered (war-weary) without tourist catalog; spatial choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace compromise) signaled early, texturally escalates via ritual and amnesty dialogue tightening options; agency in negotiator's counter "decide whether more villages will burn" forces trade-off with visible cost in embarrassed offer.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of redemption-as-compromise emerges organically via ritual/particulars, resonating in non-literal final image of night/sky as "insufficient yet better," reweighting without moralizing; ambiguity in forgiveness lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (silence as "wounded animal") biases toward ceremony; dialogue subtextual/natural with distinct idioms; rhythmic modulation under pressure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric metaphors (e.g., "artillery muttered like old gods") taught early, no loops/artifacts; varied rhythm propels to closure; opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ritual framing transforms war-negotiation trope into fresh, inevitable synthesis of ceremony/compromise; risk in poetic texture heightens stakes without gimmickry; particulars like knots/threads feel lived-in.</comment>
