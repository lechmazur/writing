<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Archivist's motivation to preserve moments intensifies through embodied actions like pressing the locket photo, earning the final endurance in writing; internal conflict between loss and covenant renewal acts in the Mara exchange without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as ink-tide-memory density builds to Mara's phosphor emergence and Charged Poise closure in weighted paper; cost legible in "wrote until the stars came out," reconfiguring perseverance with emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blooming jetty at twilight constrains writing against damp rail and supplies blooming barnacles/mussels that evolve with action, charging final ledger image; sensory hierarchy (iron/lilac/static) filters through archivist's ink-biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving moments tightens accumulatively via proximate causes to Mara validation, narrowing to endurance choice; agency in steeping photo forces haunted euphoria trade-off, with cost felt in persistent writing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory as weight emerges organically from ink-bruising and sea-page turning, resonant final image reweighting covenant regeneration without moralizing; subtext in Mara's "stubborn hands" lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (paper that bruises, ghost-ink) modulates rhythm under pressure; sparse dialogue via waves carries subtext naturally, distinguishing Mara's haunted tone from archivist's confession.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image-charged sentences; figurative language consistent in accumulative texture (footprints as commas, sea curling like page), though blooming metaphors border density overload mid-jetty without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh walnut-ink archivism transforms memory trope into tactile magic realism; risk in phosphor vision and covenant premise synthesizes organically, with Mara's return feeling inevitable from prior ink-tide pattern.</comment>
