<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prince's motivation rooted in "memory of wings" intensifies credibly to defy advisors, with embodied shift at "knees went weak" earning the custodial choice; minor flaw in advisors as pressure feels declarative rather than crucible-deep.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as layers of mechanical imagery build to egg's discovery, delivering Charged Poise closure in "I will be its custodian, or its fool" with legible cost of defying duty; orientation anchored early in palace, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via trembling palace and redirected mirrors enabling vigil; "stalactites loomed like teeth" charges final image while filtering through prince's damp, rust-bound POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (syndicate duty vs. real beauty) signaled early tightens accumulatively at egg's "flutter like a mechanical fault," forcing agency in chamber order with law-breaking cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of simulated vs. authentic genesis emerges organically through Engine contrasts to egg's "heartbeat," resonant in vigil image reweighting "possible worlds" without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature biases toward organic wist ("sky without ceilings"); dialogue natural/subtextual in "Silence" command, distinguishing prince's resolve.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("piston blossoms") propels via rhythmic variation; minor overwrite in opening image strings but no loops or artifacts dull closure vigil.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical dystopia and fragile organic pivot transforms tropes via egg's "seared" memory driving non-obvious renunciation.</comment>
