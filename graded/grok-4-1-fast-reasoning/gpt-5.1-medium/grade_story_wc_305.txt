<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses surface in honest dialogue with old woman ("forgiven but seeks reward"), earning final realization of rotation with cost of foreclosed rest; embodied via bark under nails and thinning anger thread. Interiority particular without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from climb to grotto vision (scalloped lives), delivering CR closure where hairpin seed reconfigures contentment as acceptance, with conceptual cost in rotated seasons legible in final sapling image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto's smoky column and light-as-water constrain choices (touch cycle, plant seed), charging closure; perceptual filter via climber's vine/tree idiom selective and vivid, e.g., "wind thinned to a vineyard hush."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contentment source) signaled early, deepens via vision into CR with agency (push hairpin, plant seed); cost unmistakable in "caretaking was only one season," foreclosing reward path under accumulative cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of cycle emerges implicitly from tree-lives vision and scalloped overlaps, resonant non-literal answer in sapling ("strong enough to hold sorrow gently") reweighting forgiveness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in nature-charged diction ("grapevines make room," "vineyard hush in bones") modulates rhythmically with intensity; stable first-person, purposeful compression taught early via dream-climbs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "smoke parted like foliage"); figurative pattern (scallop, vines) coherent, no loops; varied syntax breathes with vision's climax, zero artifacts dulling closure seed-plant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forgiveness quest via tree-lives grotto transforms trope; risk in lyric ascent/nonlinear visions inevitable in hindsight, hairpin-seed hairpin payoff heightens stakes organically.</comment>
