<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in the vertigo over ignoring the song versus his own unnamed past, earning the choice to hum and preserve with embodied cost in the fading glow; interiority particular via "wind against his teeth."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as humming density escalates disturbance into searching song, tightening to new orchid closure (Charged Poise) with legible conceptual cost in "almost, but not quite, saved"; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Opal shelves, glass floors, and orchids constrain navigation and repair, charging final image as petals flare and library brightens momentarily; sensory hierarchy (sounds dominant) reflects caretaker's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Song's roaming creates coherent pressure under Accumulative lens, deepening via realization it carries unarchived name, forcing agency in humming that forecloses erosion with cost in imperfect preservation; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory's impermanence emerges organically from particulars like frayed petals and "faint aftertaste of something almost...saved," reweighting premise in resonant final image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in sound-textures ("trembled on a tongue") and rhythmic modulation under rising hum; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from chimes to closure; figurative layering consistent and voice-motivated, no loops or muddle in peak humming beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of sound-preservation orchids and extinct feelings museum feels inevitable, with bold risk in lyric accrual heightening stakes to bittersweet closure without gimmickry.</comment>
