<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to free the trapped idea intensifies through embodied fear (head aching with unsaid weight) and culminates in earned internal choice to thank/step aside from fear; locksmith applies precise pressure without stereotypes. Contradictory impulses (longing vs. fist of fear) act simultaneously in the skull-pressure beat. Final renunciation forecloses safety with felt cost, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vial presentation → star hint → uncorking → pressure release reconfigures internal options with conceptual cost (fear as overgrown door). Single scene anchors orientation by para 2 (viaduct, twilight); closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration in final lines. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (bruised sky, river roars, vial's pale light) filters through protagonist's longing; viaduct as nexus constrains release under starlight, charging final image. Recurring star pin-pricks and river anchor spatial coherence. Environment mirrors internal unfurling, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free idea) signaled early, escalates texturally via uncorking pressure that forces internal confrontation; agency in gentle thanks/aside crystallizes stance with emotional cost (long-held safety forfeited). One tightening (fear unclenched) narrows options under lens; cost unmistakable in skull beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of fear-as-door emerges organically from vial/mother hairpin to final reconfiguration; resonant non-literal answer in "thanked the fear... asked it to step aside" reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in locksmith's "fear is not an enemy" layers ambiguity. Satisfies 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice stable with perceptual signature (ideas as knocking, veins torn from dark); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("I open what is locked"). Rhythm modulates with pressure (short sentences in release). Distinct texture, no head-hopping, satisfies 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (read-aloud flows from long atmospheric to punchy "It says begin"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—figurative language purposeful (e.g., "space had inhaled"). Propulsion peaks cleanly in uncorking without overwriting. Zero artifacts, satisfies 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms locksmith trope into mind-unlocker via hair-vial/star mechanics; bold lyric risk (cosmic hush) heightens stakes organically. Final image inevitable from hairpin's "vein torn from dark." Transformation test passed; +0.3 risk bonus.</comment>
