<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Guardian's spiraling calm and patient interiority compel purposeful action under duty's pressure; dentist's regret shown through hesitant shutters and mirror-handling reveals embodied fear yielding to micro-choice (phone call). Final renunciation of secrecy earned via causal empathy buildup. Minor abstraction in dentist's motives slightly limits full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: poetic density of light-water-shutter exchanges tightens to Charged Poise closure as dentist dials, reconfiguring regret with felt cost in "tremor in his voice." Orientation anchored early (dock, guardian, house). One meaningful deepening via reciprocal light signals suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Canal's "bruised glass" and wet boards constrain guardian's ripple-weaving choice, charging final fading constellations. Sensory hierarchy (visual gleams, soft slaps) reflects guardian's perceptual patience; cobalt dock evolves from tension to lighter night. Micro-setting (water, mirror) mirrors internal shifts purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prompt change via empathy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through guided shimmers narrowing dentist's fear ("loosened half a notch"), forcing phone agency with on-page cost ("heart rattling," halting words). Coherent pressure without reversal overload fits length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silent empathy emerges organically from light-water patterns resolving "half-spoken secret" into open shutters; final image ("someone follow") reweights regret's premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity. No moralizing; resonance from particulars like clacking shutters as "teeth."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person focalized via guardian's perceptual signature ("eyes that reflected boat lanterns") stable, modulating rhythm with intensity (flickers "climb his walls"). Patterned elision of direct dentist interior taught early, paid off in reciprocal signals. Prose texture distinct, voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: varied syntax breathes with scene (short sentences in climax: "The call connected."). Figurative language ("trembling constellations") coherent, pattern-taught without muddle. Minor synonym proximity ("secret" echoes) but no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: water-light as silent therapy transforms regret trope via guardian's unnatural poise; shutters-mirror dialogue risks lyric ingenuity, heightening stakes inevitably. No echoes; bold perceptual conceit commits fully, charging closure organically.</comment>
