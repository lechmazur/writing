<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in refusing to pretend the town sleeps while mapping new patterns, earning the final reimagination with visible cost in rejecting old hierarchies; embodied grief and working memory as trait compel higher stakes without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from bottle observation to diagram pattern break; closure CR lands on-page as bottle warms under hand, reweighting revival premise with conceptual cost of no guarantees, orientation anchored early in workshop/cove.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bottle as micro-setting constrains choices and charges final image by warming without opening; lanterns' moth-speckled reflections and empty pier subtly mirror internal refusal, filtering through alchemist's precise gaze without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of purpose amid ghost town signaled early, deepens via working memory overlay to foreclose repetition; agency in charting reimagined town tightens pressure under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in "no guarantees" at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reimagining vs. repeating past emerges from particulars like overlaid maps and fallibility rituals; final image of warming bottle offers resonant CR repricing wishes' ruin without moral, lingering ambiguity in returning footsteps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in alchemical metaphors like "scraping rust" and hexagons refracting light; stable limited POV with rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, compression purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with lines like "hulls knocking softly like teeth" advancing atmosphere and propulsion; varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds, metaphors coherent and voice-motivated without overwriting in closure beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wish aftermath into working memory as tool for civilizational reimagination; risk in quiet CR closure heightens stakes, transforming ghost town trope through alchemist's flawed precision without hedging.</comment>
