<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Potter's zen traits shine in embodied micro-choices like hovering hands over hives and placing clay-seeds, earning the final endurance with felt cost; contradictory gentleness toward past selves acts in-scene without abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as layered visions tighten to Charged Poise closure in "knowledge settled inside him like cooled porcelain," with conceptual cost of fragility undeniable in final image; orientation anchored early, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Oasis hives and well constrain circling actions and sprout payoff, charging final image; sensory thrum and grit filter through potter's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to understand resistance deepens texturally via glass visions narrowing to kindness tactics, with agency in seed-planting foreclosing cinder path; cost legible in unchanged wasteland versus fragile circle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kindness as timeline-bender emerges organically from vision contrasts to seed actions, resonant non-literal answer in sprouts leaning to hands; no moralizing, ambiguity in wasteland persistence lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in clay/firing diction and rhythmic modulation under visionary pressure; syntax reflects zen calm-to-conviction shift without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "phototropic to kindness" integrated without muddle or loops; rhythm propels from thrum buildup to porcelain closure, zero scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of potter-glass timelines and bee-kindness transforms post-apocalyptic tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick.</comment>
