<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in embodied jealousy ("hot twist under my ribs") acting against the job's demands; final endurance of the archivist role earned via rising timeline pressure. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("chronologically confused") is anchored but slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to Charged Poise closure in hovering realization ("jaded wonder... cannot look away"), reweighting timeline chaos with conceptual cost; orientation anchored early in cabin wake-up, reflections interleaved without flattening present.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mountain details ("air so thin it feels like an accusation") constrain the lucid flight choice; graves as "pale teeth" charge final image hovering "between graves and roofline," mirroring internal fog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to distill chaos tightens via soaring reversal over multiplying graves, forcing endurance with legible jealousy cost; agency in "pull on my boots... walk straight into them" narrows options under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fractured time emerges via feral doubles and bark scrolls, culminating in resonant CR ("jaded wonder... spoiled every ending") that reweights past envy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("ceiling beams... frozen lightning"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in peak flight without filter excess or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (lyric-taught early) propels to closure; varied rhythm avoids loops, though minor density in opening metaphors slightly tempers perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise of dream-archivist mapping death-peaks transforms multiverse tropes via grounded bark maps and self-stalking; risk in lucid flight heightens stakes organically.</comment>
