<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eccentric keeper's softly persistent voice and borrowed memories trade compel narrator's shift from routine investigator to inheritor; contradictory impulses peak in final pinning of Edelweiss, earning closure choice with visible cost. Internal conflict embodied in hesitation on dock. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of revelations (keeper's trade, gaps method) tightens to Charged Poise CR in final pinning/waiting, reweighting premise of investigation with conceptual cost of inherited isolation. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (dock, twilight, keeper). Single scene causality intact, no ambiguity at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Opal dock, mist, nautical twilight constrain choices (site of drowning, fading light rushes walk) and charge final image; recurring Edelweiss shifts from bone-colored petals to inherited burden. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (colors no one painted, mist shivers). Spatial choreography coherent through dock walk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode gesture) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via keeper's pointers to gaps, narrowing from report to personal witness; agency in observing walk forecloses detachment, with cost in abandoning questionnaire legible at "no longer pretend... only here to write a report."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed memories/witnessed isolation emerges via particulars (empty palms, gaps, Edelweiss reprise), final image offers resonant CR reweighting isolation as shared without moral state. Subtext in silences/gestures; ambiguity lingers plausibly. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature (mist shivers like living thing, dock as buried moonstone) biases toward absences; dialogue subtextual/goal-driven (keeper resumes forgotten talk). Stable distance modulates to intimacy at closure; rhythm distinct under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax/rhythm propel (short sentences peak at "simplicity felt like another lie"); no loops/artifacts, figurative language purposeful/patterned in atmospheric beats without muddle. Closure image clear/crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse trope with memory trade transforms tropes (final gesture as request for witness); risky quiet CR heightens stakes via Edelweiss inheritance. Non-obvious angle on isolation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
