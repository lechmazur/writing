<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (contemptuous silence vs. fragment's pull) act in scene; final redrawing of boundaries earns renunciation of immortality with felt cost of untied coordinates.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of spatial images builds to CR closure; fragment's visions and anchor-loosening reconfigure endlessness with conceptual cost of permitted distance, legible in final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prismatic beams knotting and glassy force lines constrain choices amid buckling space; recurring escondite charges final image of redrawn boundaries.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of post-goodbye discovery tightens via fragment's visions narrowing stubborn immortality; agency in setting amulet and loosening anchors forecloses endless safety with on-page cost under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of loosened anchors offers resonant answer to goodbye-as-direction, reweighting spatial motifs without moralizing; emerges organically from visions of stretched spaces.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of dimensional geometries and spatial biases sustains rhythmic control; voice modulates from boredom to infected disagreement without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful geometric metaphors (e.g., "braided rainbows" to "tilting loyalty") propels without loops or muddle; rhythm varies read-aloud even in peak spatial intrigue.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny premise synthesizes immortality fatigue with geometric philosophy into inevitable CR; risk in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
