<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and embodied emotion, like the "shiver that tasted like static," root Orrin's prophetic traits and compel the final helm-taking with visible cost in snagged laughter. Contradictory impulses between routine and invitation act in scene without epiphanies. Final choice earned by prior oath storage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hum density increases patterns to Charged Poise closure when Orrin tilts the beam upward, reconfiguring routine with conceptual cost of foreclosed horizons. Orientation anchored early in lighthouse. Persistent constraint of light mechanics shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains climax: lenses' total internal reflection folds light into weighted beam that invites upward aim, charging final image. Sensory details POV-filtered through Orrin's weather knowledge. Evolving environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of routine vs. hum invitation escalates via density (wick flare, sigil alignment, beam thickening), forcing agency in helm-taking under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in "laughter snag on something sharp" and foreclosed shipping lanes. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of lost shared dawns emerges organically from print newspaper death to upward-tilted shadows, with final image resonating non-literally on hoarded oaths. Subtext in prophetic past quips charges closure without moralizing. Particulars like inky rustle avoid abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in prophetic mutterings and wind-cackle senses; rhythmic control modulates from routine to "steadier, stranger joy." Stable close-third POV with no leakage. Prose texture reflects Orrin's shadowed elation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, like "burned data-spun oil in a glass lantern wick" advancing world/character/action. Varied rhythm flows read-aloud; purposeful metaphors (light as memory) without muddle or loops. No artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-print decay, prophetic lighthouse oaths, and upward dawn-steering transforms tropes inevitably. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes; final tilt feels non-obvious yet earned from particulars like server-farm lenses.</comment>
