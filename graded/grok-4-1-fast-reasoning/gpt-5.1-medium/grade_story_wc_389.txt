<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in Ilen's gritty laugh as defense against sincerity before his obedient stand, earning the allegiance choice with isolation's conceptual cost. Interiority embodied in "lungs forget how to breathe" and metal-taste insomnia reveals flaws driving struggle. Childhood blackout memory anchors present bargain without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as radio shards build to new voice's instruction, culminating in Charged Poise closure: "dawn would remember this bargain" with rising/falling uncertainty as legible conceptual cost. Orientation anchors Ilen, observatory, storms early. Single scene with anchored reflection fits scope; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt portico constrains climax choice and charges final warped-aquarium image, filtering through Ilen's visionary bias. Sensory hierarchy narrows in crisis to rain-lashing immediacies amid roiling clouds. Storm evolves causally, pressuring stance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant allegiance stake signals via radios' variant shifts, tightening through voice's obey-or-replace threat into obedient endurance under storm, foreclosing disobedience with felt uncertainty cost. Accumulative density reweights prophet role. Agency in micro-choice to stand drives escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Light/dark bargain emerges organically from childhood "dark kindly lent the light" to final dawn-debts image, reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in voice's metaphor threat braids promise/cost. Ambiguity lingers in futures' cheerful argument.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in idiosyncratic metaphors like "gravel poured over drums" modulates with stress compression at storm peak. Voice texture rhythmic, diction controlled. Telepathic dialogue subtext-laden, goal-pursuing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines; rhythm varies naturally, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative coherence in rust/choir/storm vehicles avoids muddle, even in climax. Zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prophet-call via radios-as-future-council transforms tropes through portico-storm choreography and gritty-whimsy voice. Risky metaphors like "mold colonies marched...doomed pilgrims" heighten stakes organically. Non-obvious variant-allegiance bargain inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
