<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in letter loosening his chest compels delivery and scheme proposal, earning change with embodied shift from profit-led life; Marin's curiosity pressures him authentically. Distinct voices in dialogue reveal traits without stereotypes. Minor unembodied epiphany in "small gear in cycles of compassion" slightly abstracts internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as gratitude layers build to CR closure in "this chance friendship might reshape what his harbor valued," with felt cost of Elias's loosened guardedness. Single scene oriented early via library post-symphony. One tightening via dialogue detour reconfigures options without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Breezy library under stars with salt wind and sea murmur integrates purposefully, mirroring internal shifts; books constrain shelving rhythm and charge final image of reshaping via workers' notes. Sensory bias via Elias's brine smell noted by Marin. No object forces 9+ constraint on peak choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of delivering gratitude tightens accumulatively through dialogue reversal on deflection, forcing scheme proposal with relational cost. Agency in "he would fund coffee and lantern oil" forecloses profit-only path. Escalation coheres under lens but lacks visceral loss beyond emotional.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cycles of compassion emerges organically from letter detour and workers' notes, resonating in final scheme without statement; subtext in Marin's whisper fills room. Protagonist arc inextricable from theme. Quiet counter-reading lingers in harbor's slow learning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person Elias POV with perceptual signature (rope/brine, shipping almanacs); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, e.g., "light drifted farther than they guessed" persuades. Rhythmic modulation under dialogue pressure. Clean free indirect without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, e.g., shelving reveals notes; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops in "after the symphony ends" (thrice) and template stems ("he said") dull slightly without closure touch (−0.4). No heavy artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mistaken letter kindling cross-class friendship transforms gratitude trope into harbor commerce reweighting. Scheme from margin notes feels inevitable. Bold quiet risk in accumulative compassion without confrontation.</comment>
