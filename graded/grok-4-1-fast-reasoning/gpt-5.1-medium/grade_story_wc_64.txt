<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and contradiction: blithe whistling masks inability to leave unfinished intentions, earned by chess backstory tying to present choice; final palm-press renunciation forecloses pretense with felt cost of eternal tending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via murmur density to tapestry match (inciting pivot) unlocking visions; CR closure in "pressed my palm... let the pattern settle" reconfigures memory/rules with undeniable cost of chosen undeath, on-page legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silo as micro-setting constrains climb/hatch access and charges climax image; recurring tapestry border/pattern subtly mirrors internal echoes, filtering through gardener's biased noticing of lichen/cracks without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode echoes/intentions) signaled early, tightens via case warmth/matching that narrows to revelation; agency in climb/press endures with cost of accepted endlessness, but minor abstractness in "loose strands" softens peak viscerality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unresolved intentions emerges organically via threads/graves mirroring unfinished games/lovers; final "night itself had finally exhaled" non-literally reweights premise without moral, resonant from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pattern/thread diction and biased noticing (e.g., "colors aligned, threads nestled"); rhythmic control modulates hush to hum, stable first-person distance serves lyric accumulation without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in silo ascent ("each rung echoing like a small gong"); purposeful figural pattern pays off without muddle, but pervasive metaphors risk slight overwriting in revelation beat, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostly echoes/tapestry observatory transforms cemetery trope via lived gardener undeath; risk-taking in Accumulative CR closure heightens stakes organically, inevitable hindsight from case-strip match.</comment>
