<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in resisting the woman's folder ("wrong chord hammered") before earned final choice to write the song; meteorite concretely embodies motivation older than mistakes, with visible relational cost in trust.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dust/pigeon patterns deepen to woman's arrival (inciting) and final CR (song tied to bird reconfigures history with conceptual cost of confronting faith's ruins); orientation anchored early, one tightening via her refusal to leave.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust motes under skylight constrain route choices and charge final image; attic's tactile details (rustled cages, warped floorboard) filter through Noel's priorities, mirroring internal tilt without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reinvent vs. past fire) signaled early, deepens accumulatively with woman's photos forcing stance crystallization; agency in endurance/renunciation peaks on-page with song-writing cost legible in "faith could survive its ruins."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of trust as "unfinished song" emerges organically from pigeon melodies and dust routes, resonant non-literal answer in final bird release reweighting loss without moralizing; woman's line on "falling stones" ties particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (coos as "chords slipped out of human frequency"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("none of them belong to me anymore"), rhythm modulates under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "dust knew the hidden winds"); figurative layer (light as "slow trumpet") coherent and voice-motivated, no loops though minor density dip in early descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pigeon melody graphs and dust-mote cartography synthesize fresh redemption frame, risk-taking in textural routes heightens stakes organically; meteorite reprise transforms meteor/mistake trope inevitably.</comment>
