<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Excruciatingly gentle micro-choices reveal internal contradiction between rule-following scribe and dream-reviving repairer, earning final endurance; embodied cough memory anchors motivation without therapy-speak. Backstory tilts present repair decisively. Blind spots (rule vs. falter sound) compound to realization without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via sensory cues to on-page CR: realization reconfigures sanctuary as invitation, cost in settled bitterness legible in "warm and heavy" rib-settling image. Orientation anchored early; single scene holds without shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt and no-tools rule constrain repair choice; petrichor/glacial hush filter POV priorities, evolving with action to charge final rain-metronome image mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace with dream) signaled early via posting choice; textural deepening at gear coax (faltering heartbeat narrows hiding option) forces renunciation with legible emotional cost in non-bitter settling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of kept hours emerges from repair particulars, resonant CR in final line reweights premise without moral; abandoned dream friction yields ambiguity-lingering stasis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited voice stable with perceptual signature (gentle serifs, grime memories); rhythm modulates from hush to click-breath crescendo, eliding backstory strategically for density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines, but "excruciatingly gentle" pattern (3x) borders loop without full teaching; rhythm varies, metaphors cohere (gear cough), no closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh clock scribe frame transforms time tropes via no-tools repair evoking father, riskily lyrical hush-invitation CR feels inevitable; no template echoes, synthesis particular.</comment>
