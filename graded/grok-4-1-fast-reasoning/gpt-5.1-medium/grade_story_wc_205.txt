<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's shift from embalmed revolutionary to reimaginer of futures feels earned through shard-induced chants questioning past failure, with contradictory impulses (old slogans vs. new questions) acting in the excavation beat. Elyas applies pressure via curiosity, forcing her micro-choices like agreeing to descend.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of time-images and discoveries builds to CR closure in final line—"covering mirrors not to keep time out, but to keep these reimagined futures from leaking away"—repricing shrouding ritual with conceptual cost of preserved possibility vs. loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid and mirrors constrain choices (veiling recoils time; final reversal charges image), with sensory hierarchy (taste of years, swirling bands) filtered through Mara's ritual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reimagining vs. Council myth) signaled early in shard pulse; accumulative escalation via chamber discovery and dispute tightens to devising poems, with felt cost in sealed chambers and persistent sorrow, though Council opposition off-page mutes one live option slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of possibility vs. fatalism emerges organically from branching coils (futures, not loops); final image resonant non-literal answer, reweighting mirrors from exclusion to preservation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (time as "spilled years," "smoke in syrup") biases noticing; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Elyas's whisper legends); rhythmic control modulates from slow curtains to thickened swirls under discovery pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates imagery into action (e.g., "time thickened around her fingertips"); no loops/artifacts; metaphors consistent in lyric pattern, propelling via varied syntax without overwriting in peak shard/chamber beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible time, asteroid archaeology, and reimagined histories transforms tropes (ruined revolutionary, lost artifact) into bold CR of unused possibilities; risk in poetic sci-fi coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
