<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prophet's precognitively forgetful trait shown through writing then forgetting, compelling higher-stakes choices like sending narrator and Mara into the garden; embodied emotions in "eyes filling with unshed tides"; final shared realization earns change with cost of slipping language. Contradictory impulses act in seeking the sound that evades grasp.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure: chalk tracing enduring sentence on refrigerator door reconfigures prophecy's slipperiness with felt cost of forgetfulness made legible; orientation anchored early at seawall chapel; one tightening via garden convergence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fog sculptures and driftwood constrain choices (arrows half-buried, tide rearranges paths) and charge final image; sensory details (thready hiss, arrhythmic wheeze) selective and POV-biased toward sound; micro-setting of unmade bed sculpture mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture sound of growing older signaled early, escalates accumulatively through driftwood paths rearranged by tide to shared wheeze discovery narrowing options; agency in endurance of search forecloses prior isolation with cost of vulnerable mismatch in footsteps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of outgrown selves and time's sound emerges from particulars like unwatched tapes and wheeze, reweighted non-literally by final chalk image answering without moral; subtext in silences and slipping metaphors invites lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in auditory bias ("thready hiss between scenes," "fingernails drumming on faraway glass"); rhythmic control modulates with pressure, compression in peak wheeze moment; prophet's dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("rehearsals for ghosts").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with lines like "visions arrived like seagulls, noisy and greedy" doing image/character/atmosphere work; varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; minor metaphor density in garden beat purposeful and coherent, not obscuring closure chalk squeak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of junkyard chapel, fog statues as ghost rehearsals, sound of aging captured via beach instrument; risk-taking in lyric accumulative form heightens stakes of evasion, inevitable in hindsight through tide collaboration.</comment>
