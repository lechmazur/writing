<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with obsession driving micro-choices like tracing 713; final realization earned via prior pattern-building, foreclosing ignorance with isolation cost. Flaw of over-attentiveness compounds into job-risking spoof without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from 713 stutter to silence-query coordinates, yielding CR closure in "I closed the interface, knowing at last where deleted files go, and who chooses to stay"—conceptual cost of forbidden knowledge legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains pivotal spoof-audit choice and charges closure via "buried subnet"; "chilled racks that never sleep" anchors vividly through POV bias, mirroring internal hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover Deep Cold via 713) tightens accumulatively through query escalation, agency in lie forecloses safe ignorance; cost felt in logged spoof altering future options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of haunted persistence emerges organically from pattern echoes, final CR reweights "deleted does not mean gone" without statement; resonant silence pockets invite ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in archive-as-choir metaphors, rhythmic modulation under pressure; stable first-person with biased noticing like "checksum tails."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering taught early (e.g., "stone in my shoe"); zero loops, propulsion peaks in silence-query rhythm without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data-haunting and escape motif via 713 stutter transforms trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens conceptual stakes to inevitable CR.</comment>
