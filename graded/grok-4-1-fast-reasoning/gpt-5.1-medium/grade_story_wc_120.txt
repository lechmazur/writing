<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied in "ache of being chronologically homesick sharpened into a cleaner, narrower longing," driving micro-choices like timeline drawing; final poised endurance earned through memory mapping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from revision to Charged Poise closure in "raised an invisible baton...waited for the unheard symphony"; orientation anchored early, cost felt in exhaustion/dawn slippage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nautilus shell and mirrored horizon constrain choices, as in pressing shell to glass for alignment, charging final image; sensory details (ice absorbing color) selective and POV-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conduct symphonies via fortunes) signaled early, tightens via deadlines/exhaustion and ache's deepening; agency in writing/aligning forecloses waste with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of time orchestration emerges organically from nautilus spirals and fortune commands, resonant non-literal answer in morning symphony image reweighting homesickness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("clouds drifted...like smudged corrections") modulates rhythmically with intensity; stable close-third POV, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, varied rhythm; minor paraphrase loops in "upturned hush" repetitions purposeful for tone, no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh premise transforms fortune writing into time conduction via memory timelines; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in baton finale.</comment>
