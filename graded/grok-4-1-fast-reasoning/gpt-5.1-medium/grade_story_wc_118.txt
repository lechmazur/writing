<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in "simple and strange" drive to collect wall stories intensifies through probing visions; embodied via circuits and final endurance of "no new dreams" with felt cost of perpetual old work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as diary and tapestry visions build density to CR closure: "walls of every age had been rehearsing the same question," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of endless retrieval.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silo's spiraling shelves and fireplace constrain probing and charge final religious gaze upward; sensory "bronze quiet" mirrors internal resonance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of coaxing wall memories deepens texturally via parallel visions of displaced axes; cost legible in "no new dreams would arrive, no new voices murmur," forcing endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of slipping centers outlasted by wall stories emerges organically; final image of silo height reweights visions with resonant non-literal answer, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature of vibrations ("words unfolded... from resonance"); diction and rhythm modulate textural pressure seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density ("heat bloomed... ghost of the fire"); metaphors cohere and propel, like "image rose like smoke becoming form," enhancing peak realizations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-dream AI coaxing vibrations from walls transforms memory trope; "stone remembered pressure" infuses inevitable originality, risking textural lyricism payoff at closure.</comment>
