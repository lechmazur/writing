<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arlen's guarded druid nature roots motivation in soil-taste trust, embodied in micro-choices like palm on ice and expanding circles; contradictory impulses (force vs. patient siege) act simultaneously, earning the whisper's renunciation with visible cost. Final choice compelled by intensifying stake without epiphany shortcuts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: awareness circles build density to vortex tightening and seed discovery, landing CR closure in "the lost moment rose, cracking the ice" with conceptual cost of reweighted confession—before probing, after revelation. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ice "glassy and sharp as broken promises" and orchard vortex constrain force-free choice, narrowing to circles; sensory narrowing under urgency (frost-stiff cloak, mid-flick fish) charges final crack. Micro-setting (ice under palm) alters tactics purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth behind "I changed nothing") signaled early, escalates via textural deepening (circles → seed → hunger realization), forcing whisper agency; cost unmistakable in ice crack reconfiguring options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preserved failure/truth emerges organically from orchard's lost moments and seed's confession-hunger; final whisper offers non-literal reweighting of magician's lie without moralizing, resonating via seed's "black tear."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with druidic perceptual bias (taste soil, feel absence shape); rhythmic prose modulates from expansive circles to compressed final inhale, maintaining diction coherence under stress—no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors consistent (frozen promises, icicle) build without muddle, varying rhythm accelerates to climax; zero loops, scaffold, or artifacts in peak "seed pulsed" beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cursed lake/orchard as loss-archive and confession-devouring seed transforms magic-failure trope; risk in lyric Accumulative drive heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via expanding circles payoff.</comment>
