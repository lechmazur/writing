<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Oracle's method of mapping silence reveals particular obsession through embodied action (counting thunderclaps, breaths), earning captain's shift; minor slip in captain's thin interiority, but micro-choices under star's threat align motives without contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silences densify from wind pause to star-snuffing darkness; CR closure lands on-page with map's "corridors opening into the black," cost legible in flinching captain and "endless only to those who refuse."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ridge fort and storm constrain choices (hush shelters map-drawing amid raging rain), charging final image where gold sheen limns oracle against absolute dark; sensory hierarchy (tactile rain rivulets, cooling stone) filters through oracle's quiet bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map endless night pre-star extinction) signaled early, tightens texturally via silence density to cadence shift at snuffing; agency in oracle's drawing forecloses disbelief path, cost felt in captain's flinch and map-reliance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of quiet's grammar emerges organically from silence-mapping, resonant CR in final lines reweighting darkness as navigable without moral; subtext in "half of what is lost is written in light" lingers via image over assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in textured noticing ("textures of quiet," "pauses"); sparse dialogue goal-driven with subtext ("It will show you how to walk"); stable close third-person, rhythm modulates to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied rhythm in "gust snuffed the last star like a candle"); purposeful metaphors pattern-taught (hush/resin) without muddle; minor density dip in opening but no loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle mapping silence transforms navigation trope, inevitable in hindsight via sea-command to gold map; bold lyric risk in textured silences heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
