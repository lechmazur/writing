<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses—rational cartographer vs. compelled psychometrist—act in scene via hesitation at cave mouth and reverent jar-captures, earning the final boat poise with cost of foreclosed safety. Interiority concrete and embodied in scent-harvesting under pressure. Voice coherent and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density layers from rain jars to compass vision to lagoon poise, tightening via psychometry triggers toward Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "old intention finally ripened," reconfiguring options across water. Orientation anchored by ~100 words; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Selective sensory hierarchy (smells dominant per petrichor trait) constrains choices like jar-captures at thresholds and filters POV via Elias's priorities. Lagoon and skiff as micro-settings charge final image, evolving causally from ditch. Final stalactite "ticks" mirrors internal ticks toward hinge.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hinge beyond explanations) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening visions narrowing to lagoon crossing under agency of delving. Cost unmistakable in skiff vision's "sweat and oil and fear," charging poise. Persistent compass constraint shapes tactics.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of world-shifts via scents/visions emerges organically from jar rituals and psychometry, final boat image offering non-literal reconfiguration of "rational maps end and the hinges begin" without moral. Particulars like factory-guard realization reweight premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in olfactory bias and hinge-metaphor syntax reflects Elias's mind, stable close-third POV with rhythmic control under vision-stress (e.g., "tore backward into another time"). No elision or head-hopping; compression purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture/pressure, varied rhythm (short ticks vs. long visions). Zero loops; figurative coherence like "ghost remembering its body" enhances without muddle, even in peak skiff beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Petrichor-psychometry synthesis transforms quest trope into fresh hinge-hunt, with factory-lagoon reveal inevitable from compass seed. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes coherently; no derivative echoes.</comment>
