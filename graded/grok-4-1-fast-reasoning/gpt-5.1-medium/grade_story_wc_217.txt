<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied perception (feather "pulsed like a resting heart"); motivation to embrace incomplete drives humming choice with micro-conflict (not fixing but leaning notes). Final endurance of discord as companionship earned via prior attentiveness. Minor epiphanic phrasing ("Loss here was not a wound but a door") borders diagnostic but anchored in kite gesture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation builds to feather-listening density, humming deepens to being's emergence/resolution. Closure as RR (Charged Poise) in feather cooling into pulse, with conceptual cost of "ajar" imperfection legible in final writing image. Orientation anchored early ("quiet shoreline poet... after rain"); single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory vividness (salt, wet stone, teeth-aching dissonances) filtered via poet's bias for openings; lagoon/ tideline constrain feather discovery and whirlpool emergence. Recurring feather charges final image. Evolving details (strands on water) mirror internal harmony without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in incomplete) signaled early, texturally escalates via feather's pulse to humming intervention, narrowing to trust-based endurance. Agency in harmonizing forecloses "fixing," with felt cost in "stepping beyond knowing." One tightening sufficient; being's validation crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of incomplete harmony emerges organically from kite snap, feather discord, to final "discord... companionship"; final image of unfinished lines offers resonant CR without moralizing. Being's lines ("harmony is not... completion") near-echo but dramatized via telepathy. Particulars (whirlpools, woven strands) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable, perceptual signature in "openings" and "woven dawns"; rhythmic prose modulates (short gust sentence to tender chord). Telepathic dialogue natural/subtextual, advances revelation. No head-hopping; diction biased to poet's idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., "sharp gust knifed... tumbled" propulsion); metaphors coherent (loom shuttles, door hinge). No loops/artifacts; figurative density purposeful in peak (dissonances to chord) without muddle. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh magical lyricism transforms loss trope (kite/feather) into discord harmony via poet's worldview; risk in textural drive pays off in charged closure. No derivative templates; synthesis of imperfection as motion feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
