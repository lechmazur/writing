<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation rooted in botanist's entrustment intensifies through bird-guided precision, earning the final pod placement as charged endurance with conceptual cost; interiority particular via "grammar held the last accurate map of desire." Contradictory impulses subtle in persisting post-reef death without hope/sadness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of bird syntax, pod placement, and tidal contours builds to CR closure in the vision of grasses sheathing bullets—"neither hopeful nor sad, merely accurate"—with undeniable conceptual cost of future/ruin conflation. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Blooming jetty constrains choices via crevices, buried ammo quiver, and bird calls mapping "invisible contours"; twilight "narrow vastness" charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (trills piercing orange sky, lantern beam) reflects coachman's linguistic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim battlefield) signaled early, tightens via bird warnings (keening terns for swelling ammo) narrowing placement options; final kneel at "fiercest" war spot forces endurance with felt cost in rust-brushed knees and persistent ritual. Agency in targeted tucking forecloses blind scattering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation via submerged languages emerges organically from bird grammar and seed spines coaxing poisons; final image reconfigures "future and ruin" without moral, reweighting botanist's plan through garden vision over old flags.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in syntax-noticing ("braided the air, thin and piercing"); rhythmic control modulates from trills to ragged chorus, heightening pressure in "narrow vastness" without elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops; metaphors coherent (pods as "modest brown tear-shaped thing that smelled faintly of rain on ash") propel via varied rhythm matching ritual cadence. No artifacts dull closure image of birds' chorus.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic birds, post-reef botanist seeds reclaiming war-harbor transforms reclamation trope; risk in lyric compression inevitable at "blossoms rewriting the colors of old flags," heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
