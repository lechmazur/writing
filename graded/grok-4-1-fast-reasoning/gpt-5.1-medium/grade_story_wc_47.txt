<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Mara's forced lightness amid vulnerability ("forcing lightness, though she felt skinned and thin as old wiring"), compelling the earned planting choice with embodied cost (jeans soaking, ache loosening but persisting).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from echoing shell to shared hush; Charged Poise closure lands cleanly in final planting image ("small green futures took root"), with legible emotional cost ("not healed, not forgiven, just slightly less alone").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Moss pattern constrains path ("treating them like stepping stones") and charges closure ("green islands," "velvety tufts" enabling plant); sensory details (chlorophyll hush, dripping icicles) filter through Mara's bias, mirroring internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grafting meaning) signaled early, tightens texturally via Eli's invitation nudging bare patch plant; agency in Mara's kneel forecloses passivity with on-page cost (damp ache), charging final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of growth-through-scars emerges organically via moss/plant images; final pendant glow offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration ("remnants of server light and afternoon sun") reweighting confession's wound without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature (green-damp-hush texture) biases noticing; dialogue subtextual ("your story changed this place, so shape it"), distinguishing voices naturally; rhythm modulates from hush to proactive cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "plastic conduit sagged like abandoned vines" advances setting/atmosphere); rhythmic variety and zero loops/artifacts sustain momentum to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of viral confession, derelict data center moss garden, and pendant heirloom transforms tropes into inevitable reconfiguration; risk in textural lyricism heightens stakes organically.</comment>
