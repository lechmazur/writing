<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied ache ("ache behind my ribs") and contradictory impulses (ashamed of "crooked" family language yet compelled to speak it aloud); final renunciation of forgetting earned through stone's demand, foreclosing erasure with visceral cost in "cracking open a sealed room." No unearned epiphanies; micro-choices reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry to stone interaction to voices/images, culminating in CR closure ("shape of home returning in the language") with legible emotional cost in chest pain and storm; orientation anchored early in climb and seer exchange; single tightening via lock-click persuasion suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (feather-texture glass, pulse-warm stone) constrains pivotal choice (stroking opens lock) and charges final image; sensory details selective/POV-biased (bookish lanterns, wriggling ink map mirroring memory flux); lived-in choreography in corkscrewing stacks guides descent without spatial vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (new past/home) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via stone's voices forcing buried language confrontation; agency in cupping/speaking forecloses forgetting with on-page cost (painful unearthing, storm echo); one deepening reweights options without micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unearthing buried language/home emerges organically from particulars (family nicknames/recipes vs. "perfect grammar"); final image ("hidden thunder, like grief, like love") offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing, reweighting premise via felt cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sudden absences in stone, like pages torn from granite") biases toward memory/book metaphors, modulating rhythm with intensity (short sentences in voices unfurling); stable first-person with no leakage; voice as character in "ridiculous nicknames... crooked... between my teeth."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "lock clicked open as if persuaded rather than forced" advances plot/reveals character); rhythm varies (long undulating openings to punchy realizations); figurative density purposeful/pattern-taught in book-memory vein, no muddle or loops, though occasional lushness risks slight overwriting in descent beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical bookstore and language-reviving stone transforms immigrant forgetting trope via specific family dialect unearthing; risk-taking in labyrinthine setting heightens stakes organically; final "hidden thunder" reconfiguration feels inevitable from established imagery.</comment>
