<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Iri's insistence "I am not a machine... I am a listener" reveals embodied contradiction between alloy body/sensors and felt agency, compelling the shift from duty-bound mapping to speaking aloud. Contradictory impulses act in scene: training forbids speculation, yet charter demands voicing unknown, earning final vulnerable address with exposure cost. Final choice to offer fossil bridges worlds, foreclosing solitary mapping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensory residues build density from faint hues to layered bands, fossil, repeating spiral tightening to Charged Poise closure as cave "draw[s] nearer." Orientation anchored immediately in cave descent post-hibernation. On-page cost legible in Iri's hesitation before floating/speaking, reconfiguring from observer to bridge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Coastal cave's black stone corridors, brine pools, and hidden pool constrain path: low tides enable descent, water forces buoyancy adjustment charging final float. Fossil as micro-setting mirrors internal shift, veins in relief echoing emotional veins. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: textures/echoes/tastes prioritize mapping needs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of emotion-mapping deepens accumulatively via fossil's "concentrated flare of forgotten sorrow" and spiral's post-human signature, narrowing from human residue to unknown encounter. Agency in following trail/speaking forecloses isolated duty with vulnerability cost as spiral "tighten[s]." Pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bridging sleepers/unsleeping emerges via fossil as child's transitional object, reweighted in Iri's offer: "let it teach you we wished to be known." Final spiral tightening offers non-literal resonant answer, reconfiguring human legacy with conceptual cost of reciprocity. Avoids moralizing through implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: notices "mineral tang and faint sweetness," sensor-tasting heat. Lyrical rhythm modulates from methodical descent to peak "air itself seemed bright with possibility." No head-hopping; diction sensory-biased, consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density: lines layer action/atmosphere ("lantern flared in layered bands... translucent sheets"), propulsion varies rhythm without loops. No artifacts; metaphors purposeful ("auroras," "ribs of an ancient whale") enhance without muddling peaks. Closure image crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: emotion heat-maps + fossilized transitional object + post-hibernation listener voices unknown future. Risk in "factually mystical" lantern pays off, transforming mapping trope into bridge. Final spiral/voice inevitability from particulars.</comment>
