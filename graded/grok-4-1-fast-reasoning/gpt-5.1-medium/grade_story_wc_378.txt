<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Android's interiority shines in embodied contradictions like "static... like sand in circuits" tangling with nostalgia, compelling the burn with earned change; final renunciation of pristine days forecloses a path with visible cost in blackened roses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from static to ignition; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in "fragmented wholeness, seams visible yet aligned," with cost legible in afterimages and rose losses.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dome and roses constrain choices (drying seams, root contractions) and charge final image of "renewed rows"; sensory hierarchy (resin perfume, glass ribs trembling) reflects android priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve static via burn) signaled early, tightens through compression to ignition under Accumulative lens; agency in rerouting power forces trade-off with "some losses would trouble supervisors."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of containing chaos emerges organically from burn metaphor shifting to "garden that had burned and survived"; final image reweights premise without moralizing, inviting reflection on ordered survival.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with android perceptual signature (servos misfiring like muscles); rhythmic control modulates from looping fears to "distant surf," no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels from "error messages scrolling like prayer flags" to crackling flames; no loops, coherent metaphors enhance peak ignition without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android nostalgia, data-burn, and rose survival transforms tropes; risk in miniaturizing fears feels inevitable, heightening stakes through dome constraints.</comment>
