<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the engineer's physics protest faltering against drips, earning his final "maybe I do not have to see everything clearly"; Mara's embodied loss (exhales carefully) anchors concrete interiority driving micro-choices like screw placement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from fogged silhouette to glistening screw, landing Charged Poise closure where blurred vision reconfigures grief-mapping with felt absence cost in "it does not fix her absence."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Water clocks constrain ritual choice (oldest column's base) and charge final image (drops notice screw), with selective sensory hierarchy (ticks louder than words, damp air rolling) mirroring occluded perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Grief stake signaled early tightens via screw placement reversal, forcing engineer's endurance of blurred continuity; cost legible in room's "subtly rearranged" gravity, though single deepening limits to very strong band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of Mara inhaling coolness ("sensing how stories condensed... drop by drop") offers resonant non-literal answer to occlusion/loss, reweighting "reading between lines" through particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (mapping via pauses, blurred smudges) sustains stable third-limited POV; dialogue subtextual ("That is not how physics works" falters), with rhythmic modulation under grief pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("drop fell, hesitated, and slipped"); no loops or muddled metaphors, though minor density in crack/delta simile stays coherent and purposeful for closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Water clock grief-ritual premise transforms repair trope into fresh synthesis of smell loss and birthing screw, with screw's glistening reprise risking bold conceptual reweighting that heightens stakes organically.</comment>
