<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between duty ("My duty is to the realm") and possibility peak in the masks scene, earning the final renunciation ("I will stay, but I will not serve") with relational cost to king and self. Mira's pressure as crucible forces micro-choices revealing Calder's flaws. Voice distinct in dialogue and interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from program to masks to wind/spinning fruits, culminating in Charged Poise CR where allegiance unsnaps with conceptual cost of foreclosed duty in "future had just unsnapped its strings." Single scene coherent; orientation anchored by arrival at greenhouse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard's metal trees, glowing fruits, and crystal masks constrain Calder's choices and charge final image, mirroring internal shift. Sensory details (chiming branches, humming apples) selective via knight's withdrawn gaze. Specificity lived-in, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (possibility vs. duty) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through masks' visions narrowing options to renunciation; agency in "I will stay" forecloses path with felt cost of isolation from kingdom. Escalation via wind/tilting world under textural lens coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of strings/allegiance emerges organically from program, masks, and orchard's "forgotten patterns," reweighted non-literally in final unsnapping without moralizing. Subtext in Mira's implications invites ambiguity on choice's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable with perceptual signature (e.g., "rust beneath his skin"); voice poetic yet character-bound, modulating rhythm in stress (short sentences at wind). Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (Mira's "you no longer know who pulls your strings").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative language dense in climax beat ("wind... smelling of rain that had never fallen"; "shivering bliss") borders overwriting without full sparsity. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of marionette motif with alchemical visions transforms knight trope via orchard's unpredictable growth; risk in lyric fantasy heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in unsnapped closure.</comment>
