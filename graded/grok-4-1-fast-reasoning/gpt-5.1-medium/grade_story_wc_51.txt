<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular through embodied weights as "pulls, like various moons on a restless tide"; contradictory impulses peak when own burden "threatened to close around my chest" but wrists turn to break lattice, earning final alignment with visible cost of non-vanishing pull.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from lamp-lit shadows revealing burdens to fractal branching and heaviest own-burden emergence; closure as Charged Poise in "its pull changed, becoming one more note," with legible conceptual cost of enduring weight reconfigured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bronze grotto's "rock shone like old coins, damp and bruised" anchors vividly, constraining via narrowing mouth and basin that enables orientation; whalebone lampribs and metallic breath charge weaving choices and final lift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of aligning burdens tightens via own heaviest weight lurking "at the edge of the basin"; agency in lifting lamp "by orienting properly to the fear" drives escalation under textural lens, unmistakable cost in pull's changed but persistent note.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of steering versus bearing weight emerges implicitly from fractal weaving and village contrast; final image resonant reweighting as "even weight can learn to move," inextricable from arc without moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in fractal/weight diction ("densities in the air, slight distortions") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from descriptive hush to terse peak "burdens align or they devour," stable first-person under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with metaphors coherent under fractal pattern (e.g., "shingled hush" to "invisible geometry"); varied rhythm propels without loops, zero artifacts dulling closure image of "fractal dance."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractal pain-weaving and orientation paradox transforms burden-gathering into inevitable "promise that even weight can learn to move"; bold lyric risk heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
