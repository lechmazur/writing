<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via memory-shards crystallizing into guiding facets reveals contradictory fear and resolve acting simultaneously; micro-choices like tracing the Face and Flame rune compel transformation with embodied cost in pulse-humming light. Final endurance of scars as luminous margins earns change through prior causality. Master Sui's minimal pressure via nods and murmurs heightens Lan's agency without overshadowing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as shard density builds runes toward Charged Poise closure: Lan's realization of readiness amid circling storm reconfigures stance with felt cost of enduring future tempests ("scars... becoming margins instead of wounds"). Orientation anchored early in platform amid clouds; one tightening via creaking gust tests runes on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating platform constrains choices (gusts shove, chains sing, testing runes); steam motes and sideways water arc charge final descent image, mirroring internal reconfiguration. Sensory hierarchy rune-scholar specific (glyphs in steam); weather pressures without dominating. "Platform creaked as a testing gust shoved at it" pivotal for 9+ constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform scars via runes) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via two shard-runes yielding warmth and alignment; circling storm forces stance crystallization with cost of scars' endurance. Agency in quill-traces forecloses hiding path; visible price in "cringing places behind his ribs" alters tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of scars-as-stories emerges organically from shard-to-rune events; final "cup as if it were an inkwell of weather" offers resonant reconfiguration without moral, reweighting superstitions via lived struggle. Subtext in shed husks invites ambiguity of future tests.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (crystallizing shards, glyph-reading); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to flare ("rune brightened, then settled"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You will not banish them, but shed their husks"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figuratives ("leaves... tiny ink dragons") taught early, varying rhythm accelerates rune beats without loops. Minor register elevation in peak ("saturated hush") fits lyric voice; closure image propels cleanly ("small circle of light slowly shedding height").</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tea ceremony/rune ritual transforms scar trope via crystallizing memories into luminous glyphs; risk in accumulative shards heightens stakes, inevitable in descent image. No derivative echoes; bold skyborne fragility particularizes vision.</comment>
