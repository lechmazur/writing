<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism-minded training delivers embodied interiority and motivation sharpened to curiosity's "latent blaze," compelling the codex reach; final integration of combinations forecloses untempered access paths with felt sanity cost, satisfying 9+ test via prior causal buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from doodle unfolding to codex arrangements, yielding Conceptual Repricing closure when "newly nested combinations settle behind his eyes like watchful stars"; cost legible in watchful burden, orientation anchored by inversion timing in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto's mist veils and threshold effects constrain navigation choices (prickle warnings force careful breathing); recurring basalt shelves and luminous fog charge final emergence image, satisfying 9+ test with environmental pressure on climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of accessing sealed combinations tightens via chains' pulse-reading assessment, driven by archivist agency under Accumulative lens; visible cost in timed exit as "dust began to rise... gravity prepared to reclaim," escalating to Charged Poise at integration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of vigilance-through-patterns emerges organically from seeds and combinations, reweighted non-literally at ending's quiet doodle and watchful stars; satisfies 9+ test with resonant answer to hidden-knowledge premise, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature—"prism-minded gaze" refracting patterns—sustains under pressure; rhythmic diction modulates from gliding ascent to contracting air at codex, satisfying 9+ test with no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via layered sensory syntax ("inkpots lightened, dust motes rehearsed ascent"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak codex beat—inversion physics consistent and vivid—satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Gravity-inversion access to dreaming foundations transforms library trope into fresh prism-pattern quest; risk-taking in threshold veils heightens stakes organically, satisfying 9+ test with inevitable hindsight synthesis.</comment>
