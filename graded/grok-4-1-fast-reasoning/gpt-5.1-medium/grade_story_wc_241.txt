<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between risk-aversion and rebellious casino visits acts in scene via note exchange; final writing of counter-note earned by prior gambling-probability tension, foreclosing escape with relational cost. Father's traits revealed concretely through twitching fingers and rasped admission. No diagnostic labels; embodied stress in replaying surgeon's words.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of messages (library note, subway scrawls, hospital note) builds to Charged Poise closure in note reversal and smile, reweighting perspectives with felt emotional cost on "he read it, frowned, and then smiled." Orientation anchored in opening lines; shards (library-subway-hospital) transition legibly via wandering motif. Lens taught early, no ambiguity at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rainwashed library constrains discovery of note, charging pivotal beat; sensory details (wet wool, crushed clover) filter through professor's bias, evolving to hospital monitors dripping light. Recurring rain mirrors internal shift, scrubbing world without renewal in final image. Micro-setting (mica lantern) guides choice to pocket note.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (widening perspectives post-heart attack) signaled early, deepens texturally via accumulating messages that force hospital confrontation; one tightening in father's "lantern trick" revelation narrows escape options. Agency in writing back-note crystallizes stance with cost felt in "staying changes them." Minor abstractness in stake declaration prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lucid contradictions emerge implicitly from note exchanges and gambling-safety tension, resonating in final back-note image that reweights premise without moral. Clover motif shifts from sweet-green library to sad-bright end, charging theme organically. No tidy resolution; ambiguity lingers in father's smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in probability-inflected readings (scrawls as data set, heart's dice); rhythmic control modulates from wandering lyricism to clipped hospital dialogue. Father's rasped idiom contrasts narrator's; no head-hopping, stable first-person distance. Peak compression in "counting invisible cards" fits stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "monitors hummed and dripped light onto my father's sleeping face"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative density peaks purposefully in gambling metaphors without muddle; minor register elevation in "lucid contradictions" note fits voice. Closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of probability-gambling via citywide notes as "gambling without cash"; transforms family trope through scrawls/notes pattern grown from particulars. Risk in mosaic shards heightens stakes; final repricing inevitable in hindsight, no hedging.</comment>
