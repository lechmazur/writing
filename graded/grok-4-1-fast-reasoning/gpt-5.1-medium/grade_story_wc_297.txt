<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrator's embodied anxiety ("roots tightened, drawing slow blood") and Lio's contradictory skepticism-curiosity force the scar-linking choice with visible cost in shared visions; final realization earned without epiphany shortcuts. Internal conflict layers in "anxious elation squeezed my chest," revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: visions density tightens from branching futures to Charged Poise closure ("We cannot cut or keep it") reconfiguring options with legible cost in fractured dreams vs. broken covenant; orientation anchored in opening line, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobalt glade and roots constrain choice (ankles fused, twitching impatience), charging final clipping bow; sensory hierarchy (taste of rain, indigo light) reflects POV urgency without catalog, mirroring internal eclipse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (maze cut/grow) signaled early, escalates via agency-driven scar link and vision deepening under Accumulative lens, narrowing to neither viable with felt cost in "forests sharpened into spears, waves braided with hedges."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of dream-convergence vs. covenant fracture emerges organically through visions, final image reweights prior futures without moralizing; subtext in Lio's "what-ifs" invites ambiguity on proof vs. mystery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature ("roots braided around my ankles," "light rushed up through the roots") stable, modulates rhythm with pressure; dialogue subtext-laden (Lio's "Show me" pursues goal), distinct idioms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("The clipping quivered, tiny leaves curling inward like they were listening"); minor figurative density in visions ("luminous knots") purposeful without muddle, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scar-linking travel, maze-engulfed sea, and eclipsed covenant transforms time-slip tropes; risk in visionary POV heightens dream-intersection stakes organically.</comment>
