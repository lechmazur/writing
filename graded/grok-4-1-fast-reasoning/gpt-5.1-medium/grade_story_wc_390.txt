<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's "logically emotional" trait drives the climax through circuit-like assembly of the rite's adaptation, balancing competence with dangerous improvisation; contradictory impulses peak when voice locks with the sphere, earning stasis with embodied cost in shared exhaustion. Minor tell in monk backstory does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from marina hum to crypt chord tightening into rite's RR (charged poise in mutual breath), with persistent constraint of drifting note shaping tactics; cost legible in "dangerous" adaptation and foreclosed vulnerability. Orientation anchored by para 1; single scene coheres without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina and crypt constrain choices (15-min light, grinding ice swells hum); recurring key/object charges final relief image. Sensory hierarchy (teeth buzz, fleshly air) reflects Elias's sonic priorities, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect artifact under sunset) signaled early, escalates texturally via hum density to drifted note forcing adaptive agency; one tightening (chamber matching → sphere lock) narrows options with felt danger cost. Minor abstractness in storm lore slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sonic absolution theme emerges organically from rite's particulars, resolving in non-literal shared breath that reweights "furious matter" forgiveness without moralizing; final image resonates as CR on trapped storm's memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (vibrations as "pressure on the teeth") biases toward sonic embodiment; rhythmic control modulates from patient steps to shivering thoughts under stress, with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and multi-job lines (e.g., "thudded against his ribs... metronome of responsibility"); minor overwriting in "fleshly ethereal" metaphors clusters early, not touching closure, but risks coherence in high-pressure descent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sonic rite for trapped storm transforms lighthouse trope into fresh vibrational engineering; risk-taking in "forgiving furious matter" payoff feels inevitable from established pattern, heightening closure ingenuity.</comment>
