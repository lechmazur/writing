<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Statue's motivation to fracture certainties drives pivotal consent and collapse with embodied contradiction (stone hand shifts, nerves echo); visitor's incisively kind gaze/thoughts force nuance over accusation, earning final reconfiguration. Internal conflict acts simultaneously in telepathic exchange, not summarized. Minor slip: visitor's change slightly abrupt, but prior causality (ampoule stakes) supports it without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations densify to collapse (DC/RR), with cost legible in "roots tore free; buried bells chimed" as sea drains. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene causality links secret's looseness to her arrival, mind-opening, and structural unraveling. Closure reconfigures certainty with undeniable price on statue's settling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Barnacled ribs, lantern-corals, and cracked ceiling constrain escape and charge final light-spearing ascent, mirroring internal softening. Sensory details (silt billows, water roars) evolve causally, filtering through statue's stone nerves. Pivotal: weakened column palm-press integrates setting into consent beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nuance over new certainty) signaled early, tightens via full-mind opening that narrows to collapse consent under Accumulative lens. Her nod forecloses accusation path with visible cost (garden shakes, statue deeper). Agency clear in statue's fault-line pull; no slips touch peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of cascading revelations emerges via particulars (secret ripples like ink, certainty cracks for nuance root), reweighting flood-lie in final image without moralizing. Subtext in telepathic needle-threading charges closure. Visitor's context-seeking embodies complexity over vengeance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable statue POV with perceptual signature (stone nerves, silt breath); telepathic "dialogue" natural, subtextual, distinct in rhythms. Voice modulates poetically under pressure, prose as stone-mind. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens at collapse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but figurative layering (e.g., "loosened ink," "careful needle") borders overwrite in mid-revelation beat without dulling propulsion. No loops or scaffolds; climax sentences crisp ("Water roared upward as the ceiling burst open"). Minor coherence slip in metaphor density pre-consent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic statue guarding invited-flood lie transforms guardian trope into nuance-cracking agent; underwater garden awakening risks poetic density payoff in collapse image. Bold voice commits to premise without retreat. No derivative echoes.</comment>
