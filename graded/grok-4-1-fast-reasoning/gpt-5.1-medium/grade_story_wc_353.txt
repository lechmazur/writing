<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio's motivation to sculpt music from silence drives consistent micro-choices like threading copper, embodied in chest echoes; Ina's arrival adds relational pressure via shared vibration. Internal harmony lacks contradictory impulses in climax strumming, but endurance earns final pulse realization with exhaustion cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from Lio's crafting to grove-wide sway, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure in "quiet pulse between his ribs" with felt exhaustion cost. Single scene anchors orientation by para 2; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Alder trunks, porcelain insulator, and leaf litter constrain choices (e.g., slits in knots, copper threading) and charge final image of trembling roots. Sensory details (chill insulator, rippling leaves) filter through Lio's symphonic bias, evolving with motion climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (music from silence) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via Ina's palms and joint strumming into grove response; agency in arc-strum forecloses doubt with visible cost (exhaustion, settling). One tightening suffices, but external pressure leans descriptive over visceral opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of motion-as-music emerges from particulars like crack-mapped designs and swaying mushrooms, reweighting silence premise in final "new music continues inside every moving body" without moralizing. Subtext in Ina's nod and shared brace invites ambiguity on sound's return.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with symphonic perceptual signature (branches as scores, cracks as melody); signing dialogue natural/subtextual ("If we move together"). Rhythm modulates from quiet hollow to blurred sway under climax stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines layer world/character/action (e.g., "curved slits guide the wind across their hollowed knots"); rhythmic variety peaks in "mushrooms tilt, blades of grass sway" without loops or muddle. No scaffolds; propulsion clear to closure pulse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silent world, living alders as instruments, and crack-analysis premise transforms post-apocalyptic trope into motion-empathy lyricism; risk in quiet closure heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
