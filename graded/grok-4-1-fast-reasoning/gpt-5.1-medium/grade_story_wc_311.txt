<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Heartbroken reaper's motivation rooted in child's sacrifice concretely embodied as "hollow instrument forever playing that single, distant note of regret," driving ritual micro-choices; internal conflict between harvest past and naming present yields earned stasis in ongoing work. Contradictory impulses act in scene, final endurance compelled by prior causality with visible cost in chest's echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with ritual beats accumulating density to "constellations fallen to the floor"; orientation anchored early ("ancient observatory at dusk," reaper lingering); closure as Charged Poise in "kept listening as the world sent up its nameless songs," reconfiguring regret with felt cost in hoped tenderness for boy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory's stone pillars, phonograph grooves, salt shards constrain ritual choices; lantern's "scattered light" enables shapes to "step forward without fleeing," charging final image of crystalline reefs. Sensory hierarchy (echoes seeping into stone) reflects reaper's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (naming fears) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening ritual density ("again and again," fears filling floor), narrowing to endurance with cost in unresolved regret; "echo...stirred, remembering" forces stance crystallization under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice's echo emerges from particulars (child's trade, fears born of heartbeats), final image resonantly reweights premise without moral—reaper's tenderness "barely recognized" answers naming's cost obliquely. No tidy resolution, ambiguity in boy's dreams lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with reaper's perceptual signature ("air carried a distant intimacy"); rhythmic control modulates from whispers to glittering stasis, purposeful compression taught early pays off in closure image without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density ("ink dropped into clear water") propels without loops or scaffolds; metaphors coherent ("curvature of a question mark"), rhythm varies naturally to ear-test cadence in ritual repetition, no overwriting dulls peak crystallization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper charting fears via voices/monsters transforms death trope organically; risk in ritual's lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from atlas-to-reefs progression without gimmickry.</comment>
