<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion in tracing the fresco and soft laugh reveal contradictory impulses (intruder vs. creator); motivation intensifies credibly through past ban to present projection. Final realization of shared memories feels earned via prior micro-choices like mounting projectors. Minor flaw: brief diagnostic self-awareness in "community of forgotten feelings" edges toward unearned epiphany without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from setup to projection activation, culminating in on-page CR where fog glows internally, reweighting ephemerality with conceptual cost of light's transience. Orientation anchored early in orchard district; single scene coherent. Persistent fog constraint shapes the charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog and ruined branches constrain choices (e.g., careful bag placement on moss) and evolve to charge closure as luminous carrier of reflections; sensory hierarchy (taste color, rattling ribs) POV-specific. Micro-setting of wall/fresco guides projection angling. Recurring fog droplets mirror internal rediscovery, integrated via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover joy via impermanent light-painting) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as projection coaxes fresco, forcing realization of shared vs. personal glory with felt cost of vanishing light. One deepening reversal: network reveals communal memories, narrowing solipsistic options. Minor slip: external city ban remains off-page, slightly abstracting pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of communal joy resurrecting lost color emerges organically from particulars like threaded projections and glowing fog; final CR reweights personal art as borrowed memories without moralizing. Resonant image of photonic blossoms answers initial intruder feeling. Earned ambiguity in ephemerality lingers potently.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (colors breathing, light as dawn) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from pensive setup to luminous closure. Compression purposeful and taught early via fog motifs. No head-hopping; diction POV-apt for artist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors purposeful (ribs, chandeliers) without muddle in peak projection beat. Minor artifact: adjacent fog thickenings paraphrase slightly ("thickened once more, but now it glowed"), but pattern-taught and closure-charging. Varied rhythm supports ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hacked projectors and knowledge network transforms banned muralist trope into photonic resurrection; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens ephemerality stakes. Final reweighting of data as communal feelings inevitable from seeded particulars. No derivative echoes.</comment>
