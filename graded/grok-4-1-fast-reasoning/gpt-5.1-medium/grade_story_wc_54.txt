<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Curiosity embodied in concrete micro-choices like brushing the sextant and clipping it drives endurance; "functionally creative" trait enables pipe rerouting with insurance-nervous edge, earning final stasis without epiphanic tidiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from sextant find to schematic overlay to dawn nod as Charged Poise, reconfiguring flows with conceptual cost of unseen effort legible in "No one might ever see them."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pipes and sextant constrain mapping/rerouting choices; "ribs and bones" of terminal and quivering streamers filter through engineer's bias, charging final skylight image without catalog excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hope-equations tightens via lens-deepening from sketches to taped signs; cost of solitary futility felt in "absorbing her stoic wonder into new gradients," forcing endurance trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hope-as-hydraulics emerges organically from pipe diagrams and carnival contrast, reweighted non-literally by sextant-on-schematic match without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature ("systems waiting to be read like equations gone feral") modulates rhythm with pressure, perceptual bias consistent to stoic close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful "flows" motif; minor overwrought veins like "Grief 101" slightly muddle peak reflection but spare closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hydraulic hope in derelict spaceport ingeniously transforms tropes via sextant-pipe arc, risking quiet stasis that pays off inevitably in dawn nod.</comment>
