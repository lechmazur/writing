<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Painter's borrowed heartbeat creates embodied internal conflict, intensifying with awareness of repayment during humming; girl's arrival forces micro-choice to adapt song, revealing relational pressure. Final collaboration earns change with felt cost of heart's rhythm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from painter's setup through visions to girl's plea and joint humming, landing CR closure in boy's reconfigured dream path. Orientation anchored early in terrace/night; one tightening via collaboration surprises and deepens stake without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Droplets from prism parapet constrain painter's method, rising to bend light into mirror doorways and charging visions; terrace's height/echoes enable haunting while isolating until girl's arrival. Sensory selection (drip, rain smell, wavering light) reflects painter's perceptual bias, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (show possibilities via mirrors) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through specific visions then girl's river plea, forcing song adaptation; cost of borrowed heart legible in off-beat pulse matching song. Agency in perceptual calm and humming collaboration forecloses default isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of soft possibilities vs. iron futures emerges organically from offered visions (not commands) and heart-debt cost; final boy's lantern path reweights premise with resonant non-literal answer on choice's mist-like potential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close POV stable on painter, with perceptual signature in light/water bending; girl's dialogue natural/subtextual ("Is there a song for changing that"), distinct idiom. Rhythmic modulation heightens hush-to-harmony pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (mirage/wavering consistent, not muddled); varied rhythm reads aloud as dusky cadence without loops or scaffolds. Minor repetition of "perceptively calm" contained, not dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockmaker bargain, song-coded mirrors, and heart-debt transforms magic tropes; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens closure's inevitability without gimmickry.</comment>
