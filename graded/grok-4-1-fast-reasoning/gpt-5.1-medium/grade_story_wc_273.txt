<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (serene anger vs. belief in tracks) act in scene through pouring ink despite fury; final loosening of self earned by causal buildup from raider chase to ink realization, with visible emotional cost. Elders apply targeted pressure without stereotypes. No diagnostic labels; embodiment specific (chest heavy as glass).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ink spill density increases patterns to CR closure ("loosening self" reconfigures time's rule-set with acceptance cost). Orientation anchored in first paragraph (post-eclipse desert encampment, Iren). Cost legible in final line's fury-tinged breath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ink and Painted Table constrain choice (spill reveals cuts, fingertips touch for training); Kesh maps as recurring tool charging final script image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (tracks in sand/ink, metallic tang). No white-room; wind evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why Slow happens) signaled early, deepens via ink's hoofprint image narrowing to "step between cuts." Agency in tilting bowl/ touching ink forecloses denial path with felt acceptance cost under Accumulative lens. One tightening sufficient; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (consciousness edits time's dull stretches) emerges organically from ink patterns vs. elder explanation; final loosening reweights premise without moral, embracing ambiguity of "hair's width" change. No sermonizing; irony in tracker's widened eye.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (patterns, lenses, tracks) biases noticing; rhythmic control heightens pressure (short sentences in ink spill). Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (elders slide bowl to compel). Stable close-third POV; no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density (each line advances image/realization). Figurative coherent/pattern-taught (ink as eclipse bruise, time as cuts); rhythm varies (long poetic opens to clipped realizations). Propulsion peaks in spill without overwriting coherence loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms time-slow trope via ink's "cuts" and tracker's margin-walking; non-obvious synthesis (clockwork drone + disappearing ink) inevitable in hindsight, risks lyric physics payoff. Bold conceptual integrity without retreat; no template echoes.</comment>
