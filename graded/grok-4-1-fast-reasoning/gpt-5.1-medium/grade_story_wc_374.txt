<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's luminous skepticism evolves through embodied tastes and doubt-as-lens realization, earning silent agreement to help; strangers apply relational pressure via weather archives explanation. Internal contradiction between denial and glow meaning acts in scene with melting ring as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with taste density building to Conceptual Repricing closure in "doubt was not a wall but a lens" and final twilight image; orientation anchored early in bluff arrival; cost legible in ring's merger and heavy volunteer burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Aurora, spirals grass, and voting trees constrain path to strangers and charge final dimming image; tastes integrate sensory specificity with POV bias toward patterns. Micro-setting of ring-on-tongue evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to learn weather-carrying tightens texturally via ring's flavor shifts and strangers' reveal, forcing renunciation of skepticism; agency in tasting/approaching yields Charged Poise at wordless answer with archives' emotional cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of embodied weather memory emerges implicitly from tastes, stitched climates, and doubt-lens shift; final "four small bodies carrying the weather of a larger tomorrow" reweights premise with conceptual volunteer cost, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature via taste/glow filters world uniquely; voice rhythm modulates from skeptical observation to resonant pulse in ending; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual in snow-stranger's sad forecast recall.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (tastes/weather) propels without loops; varied syntax/rhythm peaks in "biting into water you once called home," charging closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taste-compass, voting trees, and weather-bearers transforms tropes into inevitable CR; risk in lyric texture heightens stakes without gimmickry, fully committed to futuristic nostalgia.</comment>
