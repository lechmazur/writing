<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's warmly observant trait enables micro-choices like rearranging stones and joining the letter chain, with contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. trembling fingers, "felt the absence... like a missing rib") acting simultaneously; final commitment earned by prior discoveries, foreclosing isolation with embodied cost in "luminescent ache."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup (stones → letters → glass → his letter), with on-page Charged Poise closure as he tucks letter under glass and scuffs stones, reconfiguring protection network; cost legible in "fragile beacon" amid dark panes, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Curved panes "holding the sea in fragments" and spiral stones constrain entry/choices; sea glass as micro-setting charges final halo image, filtering Elias's priorities (codes, drafts) with tactile evolution (picked, pressed, set).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protection post-light) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via letter discoveries narrowing to personal agency (writing response forecloses shadow role); cost unmistakable in scuffed stones and "that was where protection needed to begin."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of chained gratitude/protection emerges organically from letters/stones/glass shifting from fear to mutual watch; final image of glass halo offers resonant answer to "Who will protect us now" without moralizing, reweighting absence into fragile continuity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("cataloged every creak, every draft"); rhythmic control modulates from reticent observation to intensified ache ("hummed in his chest"), no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("stub-nosed boat like an apology"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors (shattered film) cohere without muddle in peak letter beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wrecker codes/letter chain transforms haunted lighthouse trope into quiet network of watchers; risk in lyric closure heightens stakes via glass halo, inevitable from Elias's observant limits.</comment>
