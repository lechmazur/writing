<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via peripheral gaze and micro-choices like adjusting mirrors askew; motivation to mend timer intensifies through whispered questions, earning realization about wonder's shyness. Contradictory impulses in trusting "corners of vision" over direct stare act in the repair scene. Minor reflection via commissioner backstory anchors present without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from whispers to whirling mirrors and resonance, culminating in CR closure where "silence felt crowded, softly luminous" reconfigures time-as-echoes premise with cost of peripheral access only. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (descent, cavern). Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marble veins and lantern beams constrain choices, mirroring internal echoes; cavern evolves from "wet hush" to "softly luminous" in final image, charging closure. Sensory hierarchy (tang of iron, geometric hush) reflects locksmith's bias. No white-room; spatial choreography of pillar, walls tracks cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore timer against city's thinning memory) signaled early via commissioner; accumulative escalation via twitching gears to resonant hum narrows options to peripheral method, with agency in screwing mirror to hub. Cost legible in "wonder was shy... could not bear a stare." One tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wonder stored via echoes emerges organically from repair beats; final image reweights premise non-literally as "echoes and the angles by which to find them again," embracing ambiguity without moral. No thematic echo or sermonizing. Resonance from particulars like scarred marble.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "geometric hush" and askew gaze; rhythmic control modulates from descriptive to intense ("mirrors whirling, each flash pinning a droplet"). Stable third-limited POV, no leakage. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "mirrors on the wheel caught the lantern, flinging fragments... pinning a droplet"); no loops or scaffolds, metaphors consistent (scars, spirals). Minor overwriting in reflective beats but purposeful for texture, not obscuring propulsion. Read-aloud rhythm varies with scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith skills into echo-harvesting timer, transformed via mirrors/angles; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes of shy wonder. Irreplaceable premise: removing cavern reflections breaks logic. No derivative echoes.</comment>
