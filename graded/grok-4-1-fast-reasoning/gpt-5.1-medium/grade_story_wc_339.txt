<question>1</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Narrator's analytic trait and "physics of letting go" motivation compel the final compromise with embodied cost ("tightening in my chest"); contradictory impulses (respect vs. intrusion) act in the cylinder pry and salvage decision. Blind spots in equating own dives to physicist's experiment deepen stakes without safety-hedging. Closure choice earned by prior interior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of wreck images and note accumulates to Charged Poise CR in "compromise that felt like mourning," reweighting letting-go premise with conceptual cost legible in salvage dilemma lines. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (dives, coordinates). Single-shard dive-to-chamber arc tightens meaningfully without breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>9.6</grade>
<comment>Sunken library's coral cliff, pulped books, and drifting letters constrain dive actions and charge final dilemma; snow globes as micro-setting recur to mirror buoyancy theme in closing image. Sensory hierarchy (light beam, silt trail) reflects diver's priorities. No white-room; spatial choreography (tether to table) coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (preserving vs. testing letting-go experiment) signaled in physicist's note, deepens via salvage trade-offs under Accumulative lens to foreclose paths with felt cost in "smother the very uncertainty." Agency in compromise crystallizes stance. One tightening (cylinder reveal) narrows options legibly.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Letting-go theme emerges organically from sinking/rising books-globes and mirrored motivations, resonant in final image repricing experiment's incompletion without moralizing. Particulars (buoyancy equations) avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in compromise's mourning cost. No thematic echo or binary toggle.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("measures panic in heartbeats," "drowned forest of paper") biases noticing toward physics-emotion links; rhythmic modulation accelerates in dive tension. Stable first-person POV with no leakage; voice reflects analytic melancholy under stress. Prose as character: syntax frays aptly ("even my mind started to fray").</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "letters detached... like startled fish" advances setting, atmosphere, theme); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful and consistent (water motifs), no muddle in peak cylinder reveal. Clean grammar, strong verbs throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh sunken-library premise transforms wreck-trope via buoyancy-memory physics, inevitable in hindsight from narrator's dives to CR compromise. Risky poetic accumulation heightens stakes coherently; no derivative templates. Bold synthesis of Earhart frame and experiment feels singular.</comment>
