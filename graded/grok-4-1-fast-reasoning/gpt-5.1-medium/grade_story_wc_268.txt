<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Diminutive titan's motivation rooted in sensing the lie "like a musician hears a false note" compels micro-choices like grinding ink and selecting shivering pages, earning the scholar's realization as a meaningful endurance with felt cost. Contradictory impulses in "slow urgency of a glacier" balance regality and humility without safety-hedging. Interiority particular and embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of seeded messages (rune, split crown, corrections) tightens to scholar's arrival, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure in "graceful collapse of a thought realizing it has stood on air" with undeniable conceptual cost to certainty. Orientation anchored early in temple library during frozen stars. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Library setting constrains choices—texts "that still remembered being read" and books slipping "through cracks in time like fish"—charging final image as scholar traces manipulated shelves. Sensory details (dust-heavy light, crawling star) selective via titan's priorities, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (cedar desk, ink bowl) evolves with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unmask pretender signaled early via ink-smeared lineage; accumulative escalation in seeded messages narrows options against frozen time, forcing titan's glacial tactics. Agency in volume-by-volume pattern forces scholar's stance crystallization with sundering cost legible on page. Persistent constraint of stalled constellations shapes every beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth drifting faster than frozen stars emerges organically from rune of drift, split crown, and corrected names, reweighted in final collapse without moralizing. Subtext in pages shivering under touch invites ambiguity on inevitability versus subtle marks. Resonant non-literal answer: realization forecloses false throne's certainty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with titan's perceptual signature—noticing pillars bowing faintly, lies as false notes—modulates rhythm under pressure (e.g., pestle hovering). Prose texture distinct in mythic syntax; no head-hopping, elision purposeful in time-echoes. Voice coherent, biased to caretaker's unpretentious regality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>High density with every line advancing texture (e.g., "stars hung like thoughts someone had forgotten to finish"); rhythm varies naturally, no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Figurative language purposeful and coherent in opening "ribs of stone" to charged closure. Propulsion peaks without overwriting in scholar's unfolding pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tiny titan seeding temporal runes transforms frozen-time trope via library's lived physics and glacial agency. Risky poetic frame heightens stakes without gimmickry; final reconfiguration inevitable from ink oaths to collapsing certainty. No derivative echoes; bold, coherent vision.</comment>
