<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions like "teeth already ached with the answer" and final micro-choice hierarchy revealing values; guardian's feral traits force relational crucible. Earned change via prior homesick pressure. Minor abstract phrasing in epiphany doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening to Charged Poise closure ("Why not both... pendant slid into my palm"); cost legible in reconfigured stance for lost home. Orientation anchored in opening lines; single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen garden constrains via "mist closes" threat and integrates as "erased chalkboard"; pendant as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory bias (paper dust in winter air) POV-specific. Spatial choreography clear on bench/path.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (homesick return vs. uncertainty) signaled early, textural escalation via pendant vision narrows to both-way choice with felt cost in "dimensional ache." Agency in renunciation/endurance; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of befriending uncertainty emerges organically from margin-note realization and final pendant handover; resonant non-literal answer in "library unfolded ahead, waiting, uncertain, almost kind." No moralizing, complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("practiced interiorizing exteriors") and rhythmic modulation under pressure; dialogue subtextual ("names are doors") advances stakes. Stable first-person, no head-hopping; elisions taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("each step ticking like a reluctant clock"); metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (light/cage). No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; varied rhythm suits lyric drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of feral guardian and light-boundaries transforms library trope; risk in surreal refraction ("bushes became clauses") heightens stakes organically. Inevitable in hindsight via homesick axis.</comment>
