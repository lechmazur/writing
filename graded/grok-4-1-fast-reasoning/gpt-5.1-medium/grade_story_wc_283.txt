<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through button-mapping and echo-hearing, revealing shift from Council belief to tangled invitation; final tipping of jar earned by years of study and realization of "shared wisdom... courage to let other people's echoes rewrite your own." Contradictory impulses (inspiration vs. obedience) act in scene without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from buttons to echo-spill as CR/RR closure, reweighting prophecy with cost in defying Council order. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening at jar-release forecloses obedience path, legible in "tipped the jar wider... endless raw possibility."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Selective details (dust constellations, button geometry, resin unknotted) constrain choices via mapped aisles and charge final image of echo threading crates; sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward auditory/memory textures mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (steal echo to loosen order) signaled early, tightens via deepening realization that echoes invite multiplicity; agency in jar-tipping forces trade-off, with cost felt for "children who might grow under the Council's narrow sky."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of shared wisdom vs. sliced decrees emerges organically from echo's "tangled invitation" and button patterns; final spill offers resonant CR reweighting prior prophecy-reading without moralizing, embracing ambiguity in "despair braided with laughter."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in constellation/echo/chord metaphors; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in release beat, diction purposeful and biased toward auditory geometry without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, metaphors coherent (buttons as "clattering constellation," echo as "trembling chord"); minor overwriting in opening dust image but propels accumulatively without loops or scaffolds dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of button-cartography and jarred voices transforms prophecy trope into raw-possibility rebellion; risk in lyric accumulative release heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from mapped constraints.</comment>
