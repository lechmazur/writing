<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied decoding of wood grain and contradictory testing of distances; final renunciation earned through prior micro-choices like inching chair legs. Father's weathered voice distinct in climax. Featherly determination acts as flaw complicating reunion impulse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density of symbols, shimmers, tilts builds to on-page Earned Stasis closure with conceptual cost in "sacred ache of that necessary step." Orientation anchored early via floating town and maze. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drifting terrace and rearranging maze constrain choices (balcony view guides navigation, chair-table test tilts room into stalk entry). Wood grain as micro-setting charges final ripples. Sensory selection (muted rustles, shadow reading) POV-biased and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reunite/understand thresholds) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via decoding success, room tilt, maze entry; agency in testing forecloses crossing with felt cost in world's balance. Father's tap crystallizes pressure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sacred thresholds emerges organically from distance tests and final untrampled soil image reweighting premise without statement. Father's explanation integrates as event, not sermon; ambiguity lingers in refusal's ache. No Thematic Echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in weather-coded grain, fractured silences; rhythmic modulation peaks in "paths close and open like eyelids." Stable single POV, father's dialogue subtextual and advancing revelation. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful lyric metaphors (e.g., "sunlight came in prismatic sheets") taught early without muddle in closure. No loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks; propulsion clear in tilt sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of butterfly-altered physics, maze-as-memory, distances-as-cosmology feels inevitable; risk in textural poise heightens stakes without gimmick. Transformation of lost-father trope via calibration premise.</comment>
