<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via chalk-pattern perceptions and embodied sensations (chalk sweats, shard gritty); micro-choices like picking shard and interjecting reveal values under ritual pressure, earning final renunciation of harmless art pretense with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (mist, hush, patterns) builds to on-page Conceptual Repricing closure—"the mess was not to be erased but outlined"—with legible cost in Lark's frightened realization; orientation anchored early, no lens ambiguity, persistent shard constraint shapes tactics to final draw.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mist-coiling, dripping ceiling, and sand mandala constrain choices (edging to shard, kneeling to draw) and charge final image (tile pressed into sand); sensory hierarchy (lilac unease gnawing sound) reflects Lark's perceptual bias, vivid yet economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (skepticism vs. coaxing meaning) signaled early, tightens via shard-induced patterns and boy confession narrowing to realization; agency in interjection and drawing forecloses skepticism with felt cost, coherent under Accumulative lens though micro-turn subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of framing chaos emerges organically from mandala smearing, shard spirals, imagined sketch diverging lines; final image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing, complexity in plausible ambiguity of transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (crowd as chalk pavement); rhythmic diction modulates intensity ("lilac unease" to "fragile frame"), sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "mist coiled between them, smudging faces"); rhythm varies purposefully, minor figurative density in opening ("chalks sweated") purposeful for voice but risks slight overload pre-pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual unlearning, secret-trading tiles, chalk visions transforms trope of spiritual epiphany; risk in poetic compression pays off, inevitable hindsight via established perceptual rules to bold CR closure.</comment>
