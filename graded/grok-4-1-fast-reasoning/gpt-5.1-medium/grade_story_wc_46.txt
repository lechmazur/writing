<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied sorrow ("testing its heft against the ache in my chest"), with motivation rooted in grandmother's shard compelling the endurance of sharing; contradictory impulses (personal grief vs. communal light) act in the polishing beat, earning the final distribution with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as polishing density deepens from personal memory to communal sharing; orientation anchors immediately in grotto/tools; Charged Poise closure lands in the final image of "tiny moons" with legible conceptual cost of fragile courage, constraint of sorrow shaping the bundle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto and basin constrain polishing choices and charge the final bundle; sensory details like "mist smells of rain and lemons" filter through POV urgency, evolving with memory; micro-setting wheel enables craft, mirroring internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (share fireless light against fear/sorrow) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via polishing that tests "how much sorrow each can safely carry"; agency in weighing/distributing forecloses isolation with felt ache; cost unmistakable in "fragile to speak aloud."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of gentle, fireless light emerges organically from sea glass evolution and memory, reweighting premise in final "world holds still" image without moralizing; resonance from particulars like shards as "tiny moons" invites lingering ambiguity on sorrow's endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person POV stable with perceptual signature (constellations in glass, mist as comets); rhythmic modulation builds under reflective pressure, compression taught early and legible; no head-hopping, diction biased to craft/poetry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figuratives ("veils of mist drift like slow comets") taught as pattern without muddle; varied rhythm propels from setup to closure, no loops/artifacts; propulsion peaks in "faces fill with that cool, reflectively vibrant glow."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gemcraft as fireless lantern transforms healing trope via refugee stakes and grandmother loss; bold lyric accumulation risks poetic density but heightens closure image; specific sea glass polishing feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
