<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ilen's motive to compress eternity drives consistent actions from frost-tracing to uncorking the whisper despite warnings, earning the final success; contradictory impulses surface in nodding to librarians yet persisting, with embodied stress in ink-stained finger on frost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from frost patterns to page printing, delivering Charged Poise closure in "treaties rewrote themselves" with legible cost of risked rupture; orientation anchors immediately in library and Ilen's routine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass trunks' frost and sideways wing constrain Ilen's typesetting and isolation, charging final image where spirals match frost and cloud-sea absorbs ink; sensory selection (chiming branches, prisms) filters through his biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compression vs. library rupture) signaled early, tightens via "NOW OR NEVER OR ALWAYS" frost, with agency in uncorking/pulling lever forcing reconfiguration; cost felt in librarians' alarm and causal tug at edges.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of negotiable reality emerges organically from frost geometries to treaties sharing desk with possibility, resonant in final shelving-by-feelings image without moralizing; subtext in whisper's "leftover maybes" reweights premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct poetic texture with rhythmic syntax ("deadlines were just compressed eternities with teeth") stable in third-limited POV; perceptual signature in frost-as-cartographies biases noticing; dialogue sparse but subtextual in chief librarian's stretched words.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "page that shone with condensed horizons"); figurative language coherent and pattern-taught from opening, propelling to climax without loops or muddle; rhythm varies for hush at end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass orchard, frost typesetting, and eternity-folding transforms tropes like magical library into inevitable premise; risk in reality-negotiation pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
