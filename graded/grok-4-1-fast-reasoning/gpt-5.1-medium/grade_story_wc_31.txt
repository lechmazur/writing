<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's trait of hiding behind truth concretely constrains his avoidance of promises, earning the climactic vow with embodied cost in the "deep green ringing that rang against his ribs."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as humming density tightens to library revelation; closure RR/CR lands on-page with conceptual cost in vow reconfiguration, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sunken library constrains descent/exploration and charges final image; sensory details (silt snow, drifting ribbons) filter through Elias's synesthetic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to chase sound's color escalates accumulatively via tag's pull to vows' density; agency peaks in vow, foreclosing hiding with felt resonance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of vows' persistent value emerges organically from library particulars; final surfacing image non-literally reweights promise-worthiness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with synesthetic perceptual signature ("color of sound"); rhythmic modulation heightens underwater pressure without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; figurative layers (auroras underwater) integrate without muddle or loops in peak library beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sunken vows library synthesizes magical realism ingeniously; risk of synesthetic library payoff feels inevitable from pier opening.</comment>
