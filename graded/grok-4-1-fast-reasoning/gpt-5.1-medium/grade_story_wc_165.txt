<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's analytical interiority shines in "reading them like a position midgame" and bishop as slantwise thinking; micro-choices like pocket brush reveal traits under pressure. Crowd as secondary applies light crucible without muddling focus. Minor lack of deeper contradictory impulses caps below 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layering observations to Charged Poise closure in final hush where "purpose unclench[es]"; orientation anchored early in arcade/tide. Bishop plant and reveal link causally without breaks; cost legible in tilted board.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal arcade constrains via water inching to boots and tide timing props; vending hum syncopates teen attention. Sensory details (brine mist, sloshing) filter through Marcus's grid overlay. Evolves causally with waves slapping pylons.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (serenade monotony) tightens accumulatively from coins to bishop reveal, narrowing to collective pause; agency in guiding attention forces crystallization. Cost felt in foreclosed monotony via "tilt the board." Minor abstractness early prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of tuning chance emerges organically via bishop's "unseen lines of escape"; final image reweights premise without statement. Subtext in crowd's rippling shock answers central question resonantly. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct chess/probability diction ("invisible grid of possibilities") signatures perception; rhythmic modulation matches intensity. Stable limited POV, no slips; patter natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels; metaphors coherent ("guitars hum in sympathy"). Minor early figurative density borders overwrite, but purposeful and non-obscuring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal arcade/orchestrated serendipity fresh synthesis transforms chance illusions uniquely; bishop tilt inevitable from patterns. Poetic compression risks heighten stakes coherently.</comment>
