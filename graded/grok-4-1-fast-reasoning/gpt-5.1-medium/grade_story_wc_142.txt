<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses in dual allegiance act simultaneously (half heart Carnival/Planning Office), embodied via burning stone chip; final Charged Poise earned by prior micro-choices like feeding data to Lilo. Lilo applies relevant pressure as muralist ally. Minor backstory summaries slightly abstract motivation without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and holds: density builds from naive planning to graffiti warnings and council suspicion, culminating in Charged Poise closure via serpent's question with felt cost (burning chip as "second heartbeat"). Orientation anchored early (~50 words: raft city, Jae's role). One tightening via leaked privatization docs narrows options; reflective shards cohere without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting (raft city carnival) constrains choices (barge migrations, pier risks) and charges final serpent image across three barges; sensory details (neon tides, phosphorescent paint) filtered through Jae's intuitive bias. Micro-setting like rusted roller coaster anchors night meetings tactilely. Evolves causally with warnings' impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigate gentrification) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via graffiti success tightening to council probe and privatization leaks, forcing final stance crystallization in serpent's "stay and fight, or slip away." Agency in reorganizing via hidden symbols; visible cost in racing pulse and burning chip. One deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of order/chaos emerges organically from graffiti labyrinth vs. zoning maps, reweighted non-literally in serpent's curl posing allegiance question without moralizing. Subtext in Lilo's "Order is just a story someone gets paid to tell." Final image resonates with hopeful desperation's pivot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature (reading "currents," stone chip as heartbeat); dialogue natural/subtextual (Lilo's brush-dip retort advances goal). Stable single-POV, rhythmic modulation under rising pressure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm suits accumulative build (e.g., "light-strung alley buzzing"). Minor paraphrase loops in reflection ("half my heart... dual allegiance") but no closure touch or artifacts in peak (serpent sketch). Clean syntax, strong verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of raft-city carnival vs. graffiti resistance transforms gentrification trope; risk-taking in encoded art method heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight via chip's warnings culminating in serpent's question.</comment>
