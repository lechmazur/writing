<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arin's precognitive curse creates contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the climax ("In one strand... In another he stayed"), compelling the earned choice of the second strand with embodied cost in foreseen slip; interiority concrete and particular throughout, flaws like borrowed courage deepen without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density (symbols, aurora shifts, eels' graphs) tightening to CR closure where friction returns ("a thin, uncertain layer") with legible conceptual cost in pain's scrape, reweighting premise; orientation anchored early ("On that cliff walked Arin"), single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frictionless specifics (glassy waves, eels ribboning air) constrain ritual choices and charge final image (wave breaks "messy and embarrassed"); sensory hierarchy POV-biased to patterns/primes, tidal bluff/aura evolve causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore friction via ritual to understand patterns) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through curse visions narrowing to strand choice with agency-driven deepening; cost visible in knees pressed to stone foreclosing slip-future, charging poise at aurora dimming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of friction as "tax of chaos" emerges organically from particulars, reweighting premise in CR final image ("world needed friction the way a story needed limits") without moralizing; lingering promise motif shifts via understanding, inviting ambiguity on sacred patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (patterns as "instructions," futures doubling) biases noticing with rhythmic control modulating to compression under curse stress ("time doubling"); stable single POV, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm syncing to ritual build; minor overwrite in metaphor density ("colors poured... melted compasses") during opening but purposeful and non-obscuring, no loops/artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frictionless world, precog eel herder, math-ritual restores tax transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in lyric physics (air as "slow current") heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from promise to equation witness.</comment>
