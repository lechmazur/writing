<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Skeptic's contradictory impulses shine in "should have dropped it, yet... wanted proof more than safety," compelling the pivot to "Teach me" with embodied guilt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup to Charged Poise closure; "garden had shifted from eerie sanctuary to working archive" reconfigures stance with emotional price legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Velvet garden constrains (leads to bench, prompts wait) and charges final image as "shelves of roses and stones holding... memories," mirroring internal archive shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; figurative layering like "sunlight on a flooded room" coherent, propels without loops, though opening density borders overwrite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garden-as-memory-archive via resonance transforms quarantine trope; "patterns of sound and light" fresh synthesis heightens stakes organically.</comment>
