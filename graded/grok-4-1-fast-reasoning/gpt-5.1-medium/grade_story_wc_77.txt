<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in confession ("I am more afraid of living than of dying"), earned by drowning mirror and boy encounter; embodied dread (knees grind on planks, saliva like pond scum) reveals hierarchy of fears with visible cost in clasp surrender. Interiority particular via photographic curse fixation. No diagnostic labels; flaws (fear of light) drive climax choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal activations like clasp→lights, accumulative luminance/mirror patterns) holds to CR closure: confession shatters drowning moment, Polaroid warms as reconfiguration with conceptual cost (darkness patient). Orientation anchors by para 2 (funhouse, post-drowning Elias). Single surreal scene with legible mirror transition; no ambiguity at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Funhouse mirrors constrain paths and force confrontation; recurring luminance guides to ticket booth/clasp and charges final image (Polaroid warm, haunted alive). Sensory selectivity (wet velvet smoke, rotting bulbs vomiting halos) mirrors dread, evolved via lights awakening. Body as micro-setting: throat phantom tubes tilts stance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trick fear to end curse) signaled para 1, deepens via notes/mirror/pier to agency-driven climax (kneel/confess, foreclosing "came back wrong" path). Cost legible in boy’s surprise, clasp release shattering scene. Hybrid escalation: causal steps narrow to endurance, textural density reweights light-as-fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (fear light/living over dark/death) emerges implicitly via luminance reversal and confession repricing premise; final image ("darkness waiting patient without hunger") resonates without moral, reweighting drowning crowd recoil. Subtext in boy’s human slackening avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with perceptual signature (bloated blue face loops, damp fingertip thoughts); rhythmic modulation accelerates in pier cold rush. Internal advisor voice distinct (spoiled fruit sighs) from narration; no head-hopping, elisions (pier shift) pay off in confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dense propulsion: images like "mouths became a single wound" multi-job (advance, charge). Varied rhythm, no loops; minor metaphor density in mirrors para risks overwrite but pattern-taught by luminance pays at end. Clean syntax, specific verbs (thrashed/slack/whitening).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: photographic curse + fear-boy + funhouse mirrors transforms drowning trope; clasp as fused masks/heartbeats inevitable in hindsight, risks surreal rules (frozen crowd) heighten stakes coherently to CR without gimmick.</comment>
