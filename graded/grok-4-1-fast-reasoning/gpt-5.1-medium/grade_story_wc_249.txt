<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in drumming habit and cold-cracking gown; quietly rebellious trait compels pivotal perch and signal with escalating cost to personal isolation. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("entangled memories") in realization beat feels slightly unearned mid-crisis but doesn't flatten agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of sensory/memory braiding tightening to CR closure in final image of open sky and chosen song; cost legible in "auroral sorrow" reweighting entrapment as possibility. Orientation anchored early in garden walk; single scene fits defaults perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Auric lagoon and rail constrain perch/drumming choices, charging reflection vision and ripples; sound wave garden's vibrations guide rebellion tactilely. Sensory hierarchy (subsonic pulses to gold waves) mirrors perceptual escalation without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of personal rebellion deepens accumulatively via entangled others into collective signal; perch and drumming agency foreclose isolation with felt sorrow cost. One tightening sufficient: reflection overlap narrows to shared resistance under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of imposed shared dream vs. smuggled rebellion emerges from particulars like cafeteria constellations and child-drawing memory; final "open sky, waiting for whatever song we chose" reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of tuned futures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic projections ("nerves into film"); rhythmic modulation peaks in hush inhale without head-hopping or withholding. Voice prose-as-character reflects knotted mind consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; purposeful metaphors (headphone wires, infinity in concrete) taught early without muddle in peak vision beat. Minor figurative density in reflection sequence (−0.3) but rhythm propels to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Chorus drug's entanglement as accidental choir transforms sci-fi trope into collective rebellion; risk of lyric accumulation pays off in charged poise without gimmickry. "Drumming... becoming a signal" turn inevitable from habit motif.</comment>
