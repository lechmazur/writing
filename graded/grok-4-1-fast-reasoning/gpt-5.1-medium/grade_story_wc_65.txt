<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in modeling futures that balance daring innovation against recklessness, earning the closure choice; embodied stress in "hands trembling" reveals hierarchy of values without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as layered reports build to pattern discovery; Charged Poise closure crystallizes decision with legible cost in "savoring the last second of possibility before decision"; orientation anchored instantly by spire and lake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian spire's "black glass walls caught the pale sky but gave nothing back" constrains isolation and charges reflective pause; quill as micro-setting reweights final image; sensory selection POV-biased toward cartographic patterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sustainable frontier tightens via pattern in temperature charts, forcing trade-off of shifting labor; cost unmistakable in foreclosed futures where "ore mines flourished but famine followed."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of bending to winter's rhythm emerges organically from scenario tests, reweighted in final "lines of ink that would move people... along the breathing edges"; no moralizing, resonance from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in probabilistic phrasing like "coastlines of probability" biases noticing; rhythmic control heightens closure poise without head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in charcoal sketches building lattice; no loops or scaffolds, metaphors purposeful without muddle in peak modeling beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ignorance cartographer premise transforms mapping into predictive ethics; fresh synthesis of quill's "own small weather" charging sustainable arc feels inevitable.</comment>
