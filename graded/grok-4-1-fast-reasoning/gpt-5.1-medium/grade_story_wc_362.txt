<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through mystic perceptual bias and embodied curiosity, with motivation intensifying via quarry directive to communal sharing; final renunciation of scientific proof feels earned by prior micro-hesitations like diner awkwardness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising from quarry image to door-to-door revelations; CR closure in "objects only hold what we refuse to feel" reweights premise with conceptual cost of disbelief impoliteness, legible in porch stares.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quartz arbor and frost patterns constrain choices—quarry sends, glass enables readings—and charge final communal echo; sensory selection (mist exhalations, frost veins) mirrors emotional absorption purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proof tightens accumulatively via frost reading deepening to town-wide pressure; agency in attention forecloses isolation with cost of "inconvenient honesty" felt in responsive objects.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of refused emotions emerges organically through object confessions; final line reconfigures without stating moral, resonant in town leaning closer to its echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in object anthropomorphism and rhythmic modulation (short investigative bursts amid lyric swells); stable single-POV heightens mystic intimacy without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (frost grammar, quartz humming) integrated into action; varied syntax propels from hush to dusk without loops or drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of everyday mysticism via frost/prism readings transforms magic skepticism; risk in "responsible liar" stance heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
