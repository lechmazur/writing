<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory serenity amid past failures (prizewinning short's "applause felt like rain on someone else's drought") embodies internal conflict, compelling the perspective-swap exercise as earned change with relational cost. Lily and Marcus distinctly pressure via accusations, their voices idiomatic. Minor diagnostic hints in interiority, but embodied and scene-tied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: post-argument hush builds density to exercise climax, landing Charged Poise closure where "stories chose not to escape but to orbit together," reconfiguring trajectories with conceptual cost of mutual doubt. Orientation anchored early (dome school, arrival). Single scene coherent, backstory interleaved without flattening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome's "groaned softly as night wind found its seams" and dish's "patient rotation" constrain dialogue and charge final orbiting image, mirroring failed trajectories. Sensory hush hierarchy reflects POV urgency. Spatial choreography clear on mezzanine/floor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant ethical storytelling stake signaled early via puppets accusation, deepens through dialogue reversals ("clean is a myth") and narrator's exercise proposal, forcing renunciation of arrogance with pride cost legible in "throat ache." Accumulative cadence tightens to closure without micro turn excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of staining stories choosing patterns emerges via puppets' "reversed confession" and silence's cruelty, resonant in final orbiting without moralizing; half-lit epiphanies land as non-literal answer reweighting righteousness vs. manipulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ink dries fastest when people below are on fire") biases noticing; voice rhythms modulate from serene to weighted stick. Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (Lily's "stay clean," Marcus's "why not quit"). Stable first-person, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels (e.g., fragment-heavy hush builds tension); metaphors cohere (meteor hush to orbiting). Minor density in opening reflections purposeful under textural lens, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligrapher-puppeteer in radar dome orbits ethical debate via shadows and trajectories, risking lyric compression that heightens stakes; final reconfiguration inevitable from established failures.</comment>
