<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vendor's contradictory impulses (practicing a question the slate erases) and shared revelation with customer earn the final self-inscription as a credible change with cost of fracture-awareness. Interiority is concrete and particular, embodied in "memories...cataloged by emotion." Customer applies crucible pressure via mirrored motive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery density builds to CR closure in "the place where stories begin is...the cut inside each omission," with legible conceptual cost in slate's "faint impressions of paths neither...recalled." Orientation anchored early in library-orchard; single scene causality intact via pouring moonlight triggering revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (low branch cradles slate/bottle) and charges final image (orchard chimes as catalog updates). Sensory details (rustling pages, ringing footsteps) selectively mirror absences via POV bias. Glass leaves flashing "skies that had never existed" purposefully tensions surreal tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding story beginnings) signaled early, tightens texturally via shared absences on slate narrowing to awareness-choice. Protagonist agency in pouring light and offering inscription forecloses ignorance with felt cost. Escalation culminates in her signing, vendor's mirrored realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of stories-in-omissions emerges organically from slate-revealed paths-not-taken, resonant CR in "margin where...openings could gather" reweighting absences without moralizing. Subtext in images (empty silhouettes, unchosen paths) invites ambiguity on self-reinvention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature: scattered mind frames "memories...shelved on different branches." Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, compression taught early pays off in revelation's poise. Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("fine print...required in return").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels without loops; figurative pattern (light/glass/absence) coherent, no muddle in peak revelation. Precise images like "silver thread pour...bright enough to sting" advance momentum. Minor fig density in setup contained, closure crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of erasure tropes into quantifiable absences defining beginnings feels inevitable, transformed via surreal library logic. Risky lyric fragmentation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final "name newly inked...under Beginnings" inflects premise freshly.</comment>
