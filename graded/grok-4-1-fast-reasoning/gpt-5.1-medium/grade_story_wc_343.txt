<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between sentiment (mother's note) and Orvan's efficiency drive micro-choices like silent observation, earning the final risk acceptance; interiority particular via map metaphors. Orvan's skepticism applies immediate pressure, shifting to admiration. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations densify into patterns/diagrams, tightening to Orvan's challenge and Charged Poise closure ("corridor of clear, waiting sky") with legible risk cost ("dash us against a mountain"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words. No shards/transitions needed; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hopscotch board as micro-setting constrains choices (pattern overlay) and charges final image; starling light seeps tactilely ("pooled in the chalk"), filtered through Lio's priorities. Sensory hierarchy vivid amid murmurations. Evolves causally with bird shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart mother's coordinates) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern proof changing Orvan's options; agency in noting/presentation forecloses scheduled inefficiency. Cost legible in admitted unprovability and rudder adjustment. One tightening tightens coherently under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unmappable lights/riddles emerges from hopscotch choreography mirroring birds, reweighting "maps have margins for rumors" in final corridor without statement; subtext in mother's voice lingering. Resonant non-literal answer via play-to-navigation shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("animated ink correcting sunset") biases to light/patterns; rhythmic syntax modulates (short calls in climax). Dialogue subtextual (Orvan's creaking laugh), goal-driven. Stable first-person with no elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines like "stranded photons...pooled in the chalk"); rhythm varies (long observational to short "Square three, pause"). Metaphors consistent/patterned (ink, maps), no loops/artifacts. Propulsion peaks in called steps.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise transforms airships/mapping via bird-light-hopscotch choreography into fresh navigation; risk in inefficiency vs. discovery heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from early rumors to corridor.</comment>
