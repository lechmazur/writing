<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density from ivy mutter to coffee drops tightens to Charged Poise closure; violin's "hairline crack" and "single drop" make legible cost undeniable on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Velvet walls swallow echoes, constraining dialogue intimacy; plinth condensation and garden plants intrude telepathically, charging final crack/drop image that reconfigures stakes.</comment>
