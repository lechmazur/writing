<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied knot of smoke loosening in chest as earned change; feather traces patterns tying past loss to present micro-choice of redesign. Contradictory impulses act in protocol defiance. Final belonging realization forecloses isolation path with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density tightens via dimming override revealing shrimp patterns, yielding CR closure in light redesign and loosened chest knot. Orientation anchored instantly; one meaningful deepening suffices, with cost legible in "knot of smoke that had lived there since the village burned."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drowned city towers as reefs constrain volunteer behavior and light tactics; biolum shrimp charge final pulses image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (constellations in architecture). Recurring dome glass fog enables feather-tracing choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lights as belonging rhythm) signaled early, texturally escalates via dimming experiment orbiting kiosks, forcing redesign agency; cost felt in emotional release. One tightening reweights attention architecture with volunteer/fish drift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Belonging as "interval between breaths shared in noticing" emerges from light/shadow particulars, reweighting feather and shrimp without statement; final pulses offer non-literal resonant answer to home question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (charts curling, towers as reefs) biases noticing distinctively; sparse dialogue goal-driven ("down here we have ceilings") with subtext. Rhythmic control modulates from anxious flicker to breathing cadence under realization pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: vivid images like "algae-furred statues frozen in parade" advance atmosphere/action sans loops; varied syntax breathes with scene, no artifacts dulling shrimp ascent or redesign peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of landscape astrology underwater transforms light-failure trope via biolum invitation tides; risk in poetic compression heightens belonging stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight redesign.</comment>
