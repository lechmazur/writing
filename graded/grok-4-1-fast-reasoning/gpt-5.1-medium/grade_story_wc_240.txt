<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the laser-hover hesitation countered by Rae's hand, earning the final override choice with relational cost; interiority particular via spatial vectors avoids stock phrasing. Voice coherent and embodied under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of barrier images builds to Charged Poise CR at door opening ("precise alignment"), with felt cost in "change the model forever" and shared hesitation legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mycelium veils and scratched plastic door constrain reflection and charge final image as "constellations mapping possible futures"; selective sensory hierarchy (glow pulses as heartbeat) biases via POV expertise without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hold walls vs. let go) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through Rae's grounding and dialogue to agency-driven override narrowing options; cost unmistakable in strangers' startled step-back and mirrored confusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of permeable alignment emerges organically from mycelium proof and door scratches reprising mirrors; final shared hesitation offers resonant non-literal reweighting of security premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in vector/mirror idiom biases noticing; dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("other ways to draw lines"), with clean first-person stability modulating rhythm under tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety propels via short punchy sentences at peak ("The strangers stepped back first, startled, then forward"); high figurative density purposeful and pattern-taught (wildfire motif), no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mushroom farm security transforms intrusion tropes into fresh physics-of-letting-go premise; risk in quiet opening heightens stakes, with door hesitation inevitable from spatial patterns.</comment>
