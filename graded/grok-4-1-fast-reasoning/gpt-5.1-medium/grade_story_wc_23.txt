<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied ("left hand creaks where bone meets brass," "phantom aches"); contradictory impulses in lying about the chapel despite knowing ruins await, earning final endurance with cost of raw solace. Flaw of borrowed memories drives struggle without safety-hedging. Micro-choices like cupping censer foot reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from phone ring to map-drawing fragments culminating in Charged Poise closure ("moon... steadies the trembling maps," reconfiguring loss with cost of imagined passage). Orientation anchored early (Rian in failing station at midnight). Single continuous scene, no shards; cost legible in "no chapel... but space... to set down your ghosts."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Phosphorescent panels and censer foot constrain choices (focus signals, hold coordinates); moon fluctuation charges final image ("moon, almost full, steadies the trembling maps"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (gravel phantom under absent boots). Details tactile and evolve (dead lights but starlight through crack).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart home through loss) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Mara's fragments and map-drawing to pause at salt flats; agency in lying forecloses real chapel option with felt cost. Pressure coheres emotionally under Textural lens; one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of imagined passages softening loss emerges organically from map-building and lie; final image ("Mara walks... where losing began, and maybe... where it can soften") reweights reverse migration without moralizing. Subtext in censer reprise shifts from ruin to holy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature ("lines rise from instinct rather than memory"); rhythmic modulation under pressure (short fragments in call). Stable distance, purposeful compression taught early; dialogue natural/subtextual ("Do you see it... Yes, I lie").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring emotional build; minor "almost" reprise purposeful, no loops. Figurative coherence (cables as "tired veins," antennae "shiver"); no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-flood navigator stitching memory-maps via phone; risk in lyric elision pays off at closure. Premise transformed through "geography of loss" and censer anchor; no templates, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
