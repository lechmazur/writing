<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysa's interiority shines in "fierce tenderness rising in her, sharp enough to cut yet careful not to pierce," embodying contradictory impulses that earn the vision's closure choice; brother's pride-clamped tongue reveals flaws driving inevitable mistake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build to CR closure in "I was afraid" pane, with rewind vision as resonant reconfiguration carrying conceptual cost of unspoken choice; orientation anchored immediately in skiff/mangroves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mangrove roots "like ribs" and shard constrain evocation choice, charging final quieter pulse; phosphorescent algae wounds evolve with events, mirroring internal states through tactile integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to evoke pre-decision moment tightens via spirits' scream-to-uncoil and vision deepening, forcing Lysa's pane-touch agency with cost in snapped-back ragged breath; one decisive pressure point suffices under lens.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of apologies waiting unspoken emerges organically from letters/condensation/spirits' song, reweighted in final "fragile map" image without moralizing; resonance from brother's fear confronting client's collapsed face.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("gusts of vowels that fogged the edges of hearing") stable in single POV, modulating rhythm to pressure peaks like vision snap; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "chest caged with mangrove roots" woven into action without muddle, though figurative density borders heavy in vision beat; no loops, varied rhythm propels to charged end image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mangrove spirits and gargoyle shard transforms apology trope into pre-decision haunt; risk in rewind mechanic heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via shard's evolving pulse.</comment>
