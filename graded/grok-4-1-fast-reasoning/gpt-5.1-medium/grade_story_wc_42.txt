<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion in tremor-echoing knees and listening to system sounds; micro-choices like bypassing filters reveal values under pressure. Earned endurance in holding configuration through aftershocks forecloses safe protocol with felt tool-risk cost. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses caps below 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from data surge to quake crest; closure as Charged Poise in sealing clarity post-aftershock, cost legible in risked array alignment ("let the safety systems close like eyelids"). Orientation anchored early in observatory and Ilias's role; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tools like trembling mirrors and Camera Three constrain pivotal repair choice and charge final archive seal. Sensory hierarchy (micrometeorites ticking, regolith groan) reflects Ilias's priorities, integrated into action; body/setting evolution mirrors internal resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture stellar death signaled early, escalates via surge/quake under Accumulative lens, tightening in raw data coax amid sway. Agency in overrides/restructuring drives deepening with tool-breakage cost; final image crystallizes trade-off legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of harnessing ephemeral emerges organically via Alma's echoed voice and data capture, resonant CR in "luminous ache of numbers" and laugh surfacing without statement. Particulars like bypassed filters reweight persistence vs. evanescence; ambiguity lingers in funding survival.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sound/texture bias ("judge signal strength by the sound of a leaf falling") persists under stress; rhythmic modulation accelerates in quake heave. Stable single POV with clean free indirect; purposeful compression legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "shrieked in its little glass cage" advances clock motif and panic); varied rhythm/read-aloud propulsion, no loops or artifacts. Figurative language purposeful (sky as "invisible hot rain"), coherent in peak crest.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi observatory quake with lyric textural drive transforms stellar death trope via Alma's relic clock and leaf metaphor. Risky poetic voice heightens stakes organically; hindsight inevitability in ephemeral capture from early foundations shake.</comment>
