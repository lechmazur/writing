<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority particular through embodied regret tied to objects like lace and compass; motivation intensifies via micro-choices like tracing loops and following needle. Final apology blooms as earned violet with felt cost of prior harshness. Minor abstraction in "color of unspoken apologies" but anchored in scene actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from jerking compass to grove lace discovery to warming needle and horizon mist; CR closure in easing space with conceptual cost of severance. Orientation anchored early in islet/tools/box. One tightening via needle locking on grove suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring lace/compass as micro-setting constrain choices (tracing, lifting) and charge final fluttering image. Sensory hierarchy (salt-sweet breeze, wet soil like books/seaweed) reflects POV's regretful attunement. "Cerulean regret" evolves to "sea-stained violet," mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unspoken apology) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via lace light diffusing words into violet color; agency in breathing apology into lace forecloses verbal path with felt relational cost. Horizon mist gathers as charged poise under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of object-mediated remembrance emerges organically from compass/lace motifs shifting to translate regret; final ships as "vessels for what people had been too late to say" reweights premise non-literally. No moralizing; ambiguity in Mira's location lingers with resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in color/smoke/sea metaphors; voice texture modulates rhythmically from placid to freshening breeze at peak. No elision or head-hopping; diction like "sea-stained violet" reflects mind under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("rhythmically placid" reprise, "blue of distance and gray of smoke") dulls one beat without obscuring closure. No loops; propulsion clear in object-driven advances. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lace as navigable sorrow instructions transforms ghost ship trope into fresh object-remembrance synthesis; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in violet apology image. Bold conceptual integrity without retreat from severance premise.</comment>
