<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and contradictory impulses (protocol vs. human-like ping) compel override and surrender; embodied emotions peak in impossible smells during vial interaction. Final choice to become archive earned by causal buildup. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ping initiates density increase through drone, vial, message to CR closure with conceptual cost (self as archive). Orientation anchored early in control sphere. One tightening via memory intake suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Temple and sphere constrain drone action and charge final splendor image; sensory hush pressures perception narrowing. POV-filtered details (thermal haze, algae) evolve with events. Micro-setting (vial turning in current) mirrors internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (respond vs. isolation) deepens via lens to memory preservation; agency in override and shutdown forecloses safety with power alarms as cost. Escalation driven by protagonist's drone send and surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral memory preservation emerges organically via vial's intake; final image reweights isolation as charged poise without moralizing. Particulars (glyphs to English, grandmother's soap) yield resonant CR.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature (silence as rib-weight, perfumed water) modulates rhythmically under stress; stable distance enhances intimacy. Prose texture reflects deep-sea lyric mind without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—e.g., "pillars scabbed with coral" integrates vividly. Propulsion aligns with accumulative intensification.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-vessel artifact in geothermal temple transforms isolation trope; vial's spiral sigil and intake inevitability heighten conceptual stakes organically. Bold lyric risk pays off in CR.</comment>
