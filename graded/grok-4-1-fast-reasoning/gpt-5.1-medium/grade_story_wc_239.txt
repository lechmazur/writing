<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in role as end witness intensifies through ritual performance, with embodied sensations like "tasting the words like a key made of dust and light." Interiority concrete and particular, but lacks overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, missing 9+ test. Final weighing earns closure via prior cycles remembered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pacing to chamber reveal and books rustling, culminating in RR (histories braided) with conceptual cost of discarded timelines legible in "knotting at the center." Orientation anchored early (No-One in temple library amid cosmic cycles). No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint of dictionary shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (dust hush, sideways candles) filtered through No-One's priorities integrate into action; library constrains path via "corridors folding back," charging closure as stacks part. Micro-setting (obsidian lectern, ringed books) mirrors spiral and enables ritual. 9+ test met via setting shaping final unification image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unify timelines before reset) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via hiccup lurch and books pressing mind, narrowing to weighing with agency in refusal to flinch. One tightening suffices: chamber reveal forces stance crystallization. Cost felt in draft on skin and foreclosed paths; legible at "spirals of possibility drew tight."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unifying illusions emerges organically from spiral walking and history-weighing, with subtext in dictionary's shifting words. Final image ("one history, braided from all") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting multiplicity into singular poise, no moralizing. 9+ test met; counter-readings linger in afterimage of cycles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct lyrical texture: syntax coils like spirals ("turning and turning"), perceptual bias toward cosmic patterns. Rhythmic control heightens under hiccup stress without slippage; purposeful compression taught early pays off at closure. No dialogue; voice as character via "murmured, tasting the words."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences vary rhythm, weaving action and image without loops, though dense figurative in peak ("strands of a single rope") borders overwriting but coheres in pattern-taught spiral motif. Zero scaffold; clarity intact at closure hush. Minor register elevation fits mythic voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic librarian unifying timelines via self-rewriting dictionary and embodied spiral transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmick; "spiral arbitration" inflection inevitable from particulars. Transformation test passed: premise uniquely constrains closure.</comment>
