<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory impulses (recon vs. wonder) act in scene through urge to catalog vs. immersion, earning final professional renunciation; Mara's traits compel via guidance. Minor slip: emotions occasionally abstract (e.g., "professional horror") without full embodiment. Final choice forecloses mapping path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from garden entry to phone confessions tightening realization; orientation anchored immediately in underground garden. Closure as CR lands on-page in final line ("Maybe work now was to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke"), reweighting premise with conceptual cost of failed grid. No orientation debt; lens unambiguous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (pulsing soil, chamomile fog, metallic air) filters through researcher's bias, constraining entry via arrowhead archway and charging plants-as-echoes image. Environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism; spatial choreography coherent. Recurring garden pulses evolve to match hum, guiding climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map threat) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via confessions revealing redistribution, forcing realization that narrows options. Agency in handling phone alters knowledge with legible cost (professional worldview cracks). One decisive deepening suffices; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformation (erasure to chorus) emerges organically from plant echoes and voices; final image reconfigures "harmony untamed" without moralizing, reweighting threat premise. Subtext in Mara's refusal layers complexity; no tidy resolution, ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in poetic, biased noticing (e.g., "bruise in reality"); stable first-person with clean distance. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Mara's "You carry the mountain on your face" pursues guidance goal). Rhythm modulates with immersion; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful lyricism (e.g., opening anchors stakes); minor overwriting via figurative density in entry beat slightly muddles propulsion without harming closure. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptid lore into plant-metamorphosis via confessions transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in textural build heightens stakes. Final CR ("cosmic joke") inevitable from garden particulars; bold voice commits to premise without retreat.</comment>
