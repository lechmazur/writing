<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction between professional hedging and personal longing, embodied in heart-kicking jolt at cabinet recognition; final renunciation of catalog certainty via handwritten note earns change with felt cost of accepting loss. Contradictory impulses act on-page without summary. Voice-specific flaws like "confidently uncertain" complicate appraisal micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory density tightens from amp inspection to grille cloth trigger, culminating in on-page Conceptual Repricing: "Provenance uncertain, but history priceless" reconfigures past losses with conceptual cost of dim purpose. Orientation anchors early; single scene coherent. Persistent constraint of suspension shapes freelance stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quarry trailer micro-setting constrains appraisal via wobbly table and echoing silence mirroring "after the applause"; grille cloth charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (shuddering trucks, fluorescent buzz) reflects Eli's biased priorities. Evolving details integrate with action, avoiding static catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of authenticating amp deepens under Accumulative lens via recognition reversal, narrowing to endurance of personal history over professional certainty; agency in final note forecloses denial with felt emotional cost. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of purpose amid loss emerges organically from applause-quarry parallels and amp particulars, reweighted in final note's resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in silences and hedging invites ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature: facts insulate amid stress, modulating rhythm in peak recognition ("jolt that bypassed thought"). Syntax reflects fragmented mind under memory pressure. No head-hopping; compression purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm accelerates from inspection beats to closure image; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures. Strategic telling anchors reflection to props like grille cloth. Sentence propulsion breathes with emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie past into appraiser present via tactile amp recognition transforms faded-dream trope; risk in echo-valley parallels heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious final note reconfigures provenance as personal history. Bold voice commits to reflective texture.</comment>
