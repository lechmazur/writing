<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ansel's infinite patience and secretive craft drive patient micro-choices like clumsy initial steps evolving to coherent rhythm, earning the closure endurance with isolation's felt cost. Interiority particularized in visions of past town balancing present tuning. No deep contradictory impulses, but flaws like solitary persistence complicate revival authentically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: footstep density builds to bells humming and woman's arrival as Charged Poise RR, reconfiguring town's stasis with fragile cost in "the work of revival finally began." Orientation anchored in first paragraph. One tightening via repeated walks suffices; cost legible in final image of two lives choosing to stay.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobblestones and archway constrain rhythm-mapping choice; fog and dust evolve tactilely through walks. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased: sounds prioritized per tuner's ear. Recurring stones charge final shiver, mirroring internal balance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore balance) signaled early; accumulative escalation via footstep cadence tightening to woman's joining narrows isolation option with endurance cost. Agency in persistent walks forces town response. Minor abstractness in early grief, but closure charges visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of shared rhythm pulling return emerges organically from bells' recognition and final footsteps syncing, reweighting collapse's loss without moralizing. Returning fork/stones motif shifts from tremor to flare, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature: town as breathing entity, selective to sonic weights. Rhythmic prose mirrors footsteps, modulating intensity without slippage. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer action, image, reflection without loops. Varied rhythm passes ear test; minor figurative density in reflections purposeful for textural lens, no muddle at peak walks or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tuning footsteps revives town via balance, transforming ghost town trope through sonic craft. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; irreplaceable fork-stone premise inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
