<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in mercy's cost vs. memory's necessity act through shaking hands and oath recall; final song renunciation earned by causal swaddling history, foreclosing numb survival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density of memory shards building to song's propagation; closure as resonant reconfiguration lands on-page in mica brightening and realm's shuddering honesty, with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mica window and pear trees with trapped sunsets constrain climax choice and charge final dawn image; glass roots chiming under steps integrate tactile specificity to mirror memory stir.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to rekindle via memory return signaled early, escalates accumulatively through satchel emptying to world-echo; agency in shard-touching song forces crystallization, cost legible in raw reactions and shudder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory's double edge emerges implicitly from swaddled shards returning home; final hearts casting rays offers resonant reweighting of mercy without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature filters through memory-keeper bias in echoing winds and shard warmth; stable close-third POV heightens resonance, rhythmic control modulates to charged poise at song's release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds, high density propels via varied syntax in peak song beat; metaphors cohere purposefully around fractures and weaving without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mica-reflected absence and song-pathways into awakening feels inevitable; risks dense lyricism for charged payoff in dawn from people.</comment>
