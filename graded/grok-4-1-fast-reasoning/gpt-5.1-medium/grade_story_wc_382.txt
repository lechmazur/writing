<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act early (sugar insistence vs. bared theory admission), and final seal grasp earned via ritual causality with cost of embracing denials; tutor's patient traits distinguish without archetype dominance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from kitchen shard to rooftop, with CR closure in "I realized then that learning the language of old buildings meant learning to carry their denials as gently as their truths"—cost legible in tenancy's illusions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rooftop garden and seal constrain final choice (pressing to unlock voice), charging image; sensory hierarchy (paper-taste air, basil/meteors) filters via POV urgency without white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn building tongue) signaled early, deepens texturally at meteor ring revelation narrowing to lies/truths endurance; agency in grasping seal forecloses naive translation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image offers resonant non-literal answer (grasp seal amid building's tenancy lies) reweighting lies-as-truths premise without moralizing; emerges organically from sugar ritual to whispers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct synesthetic perceptual signature ("air should not taste like paper") and rhythmic modulation under pressure; dialogue subtextual/natural, POV stable without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm, coherent metaphors ("voice patiently nimble, like fingers turning pages"); no loops/artifacts dulling meteor peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-mentor trope via building-language synthesis and seal-unlocked murmurs; rooftop meteors/ritual inevitability feels fresh, risk heightens stakes cleanly.</comment>
