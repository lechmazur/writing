<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's spatially imaginative trait embodies interiority concretely ("buildings as organs"), with contradictory ache driving micro-choice to touch film; final reconfiguration of goodbyes as "unfinished reels" earned via prior visions, foreclosing failure narrative with chest ache cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as visions density-build to CR closure; "film cooling in her hand" images undeniable conceptual cost of projecting anew, orientation anchored early in booth climb.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Booth's dust/metal constrains psychometry choice and charges projector flicker; palace as "heart that had forgotten its beat" mirrors internal stake purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to locate unused love tightens accumulatively via visions narrowing to margins-of-stories realization; agency in awareness-slip forecloses prior ache with on-page reconfiguration cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of deleted scenes as love storage emerges via fragments like "aborted hugs"; final "choice of ending" reweights premise non-literally, her fragments confirming without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("rain braided the neon") biases toward spatial synesthesia, stable POV; dialogue subtextual ("You are the seer"), modulating rhythm under vision pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in "images slid against her mind, out of order yet insistently connected" propels without loops; metaphors cohere, varying rhythm charges closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Film splicing for unsent love premise transforms longing trope organically; psychometry on emulsion frames risks bold synthesis, inevitable via booth logic charging CR.</comment>
