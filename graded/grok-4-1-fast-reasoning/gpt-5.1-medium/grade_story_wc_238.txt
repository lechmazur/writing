<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied contradictions like pulse syncing with rail hum; past mistake compels confession choice at climax, foreclosing her column's coy persona with reputational cost. Flaw of turning friendship to "copy" drives renunciation without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density and metaphor currents build to Charged Poise closure when confession sends amid approving surge, reweighting past with conceptual cost of public admission. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored by ~100 words in conservatory descent; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Archive as copper-veined "switchboard" constrains rite (glitches as telegraphs) and charges final surge/applause image. Sensory hierarchy (smells of mold/perfume, sparks) reflects Mirabel's priorities; orchard hush outside mirrors internal release without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology/reconnection) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as ghost metaphors "cut upward" to force confession; agency in unscrewing bottle and hitting send forecloses evasion path with felt reputational cost legible in guiding hand moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of manufactured hauntings emerges organically from column-curse backstory to confession resolution; final "something finally released" offers non-literal resonant answer to consequences of words, reweighting metaphors from sequins to scalpels without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in journalist-ghostly diction ("gossip-column exorcist," "spiritual telegraphs"); stable single POV with rhythmic modulation under pressure—no head-hopping, elisions purposeful and paid in currents.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (headlines to ghost responses), no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies (short surge sentences peak at "She sent the piece"), clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exorcism via syndicated confession transforms ghost trope through currents-as-metaphors; risk in "imperfect miracles" realization heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight from archive switchboard premise.</comment>
