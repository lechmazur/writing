<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marrow's contradictory ache for visibility and methodical hiddenness drive embodied micro-choices like tape playback, earning his realization of indirect presence without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as tape discovery accumulates sensory echoes into vent playback, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure: "He was visible now... through their own awakened senses," with cost of enduring invisibility legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crawl spaces and vents constrain indirect intervention, charging final "sapphire hush deepened... filled with breath" sympathy; sensory details (wires hum, wet wool) filter through Marrow's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tape playback deepens stake of visibility by resonating librarian's pain, forcing endurance of hidden agency; cost felt in sagging shoulders and Marrow's reflected presence foreclosing direct sight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of "trembling... hands" and deepened hush reweights theme of echoed visibility non-literally, emerging organically from cached memories without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (sense memory as "secret language") stable in single POV, rhythmic syntax modulates from hush to "thunderous" scrape without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action/imagery (tape "clinging like cobweb"); varied rhythm propels to charged closure, zero loops or muddled figures.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh crawl-space "hollow bones" dweller synthesizing analog tapes and sense memory transforms helper-ghost trope, with risky indirect closure inevitable from premise.</comment>
