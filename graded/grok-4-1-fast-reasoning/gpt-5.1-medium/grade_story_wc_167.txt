<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory impulses—practical glazier duties versus poetic need to "illuminate value in the mundane"—act simultaneously in climbing the ladder and tracing the mullion, earning the final micro-choice to demand an unquantifiable report with visible cost to efficiency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, orientation anchors glazier at Pearl Bay jetty by ~100 words; closure as Charged Poise/CR lands on-page in the request for "one more day," reconfiguring stakes with conceptual cost of lost refraction legible in the final image of water-glass agreement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atrium glass and quarry pond constrain choices (ladder climb reveals calm surface priming verdict) and charge final image; sensory details like "colors floated inside the fog like thoughts half-remembered" selectively mirror internal priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve atrium's essence) signaled early, tightens texturally via pond's calm against prior "restless" rings and Kade's 3-day clock, forcing narrator's stance crystallization in report/extra day with felt cost of impending erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of refraction's value emerges organically from glass mirroring shore fractures and pond rings; final image non-literally answers by crystallizing "what the water and the glass agreed upon," reweighting progress with resonant ambiguity and no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in light-water-glass diction ("glass remembers impacts") biases noticing character-specifically; stable first-person distance modulates rhythmically under pressure, with Kade's dialogue subtextually contrasting via "practical laugh."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering ("quiet rainbows," "noctilucent reckonings") avoids muddle in peak observation beats; varied syntax propels accumulatively to closure image without loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glazier reading harbor via pond rings transforms preservation trope into fresh perceptual frame; risk-taking in sustained metaphor synthesis feels inevitable, heightening stakes through irreplaceable glass-water logic.</comment>
