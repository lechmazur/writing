<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Deeply embodied interiority via touch and light perception reveals prosopagnosia as navigational frame without therapy-speak; final realization earns closure via prior painting choices under pressure. Coin and safe anchor motivation consistently. Minor label "Prosopagnosia" early is offset by dramatized limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from stillness to layered skies and horns tightening to CR closure—"some limits were not failures but frames"—with cost in "no more space." Single scene oriented early; pattern pays off without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fractal shelves and dust motes constrain painting and charge final warped boards; tactile grain and smells filter through Mara's priorities. Sensory narrowing under horns mirrors urgency. Environment evolves with horns, lived-in via fingertips.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compress skies) signaled early; horns escalate via Accumulative cadence, forcing renunciation with agency in brush strokes. Cost legible in boards "ready to warp," foreclosing endless pretense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of limits-as-frames emerges from sky compression and face-blind navigation; final image reweights premise without statement—"forcing her to meet each person as new light." Particulars like coin indentations avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias for light/grain stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from poised hush to stroke urgency. Compression taught early, legible at CR. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds, metaphors purposeful (skies "ribboning"). Propulsion peaks in "color seeped outward," propelling to closure image. Minor light repetition patterned, not churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Face-blind sky-painter in fractal tree transforms tropes organically; coin-map discovery and limit-realization inflections feel inevitable. Bold lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
