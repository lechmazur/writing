<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ariel's embodied tasting of memories via seed drives inciting swallow and future-choosing; contradictory affection/scolding with Kai reveals wise flaws under pressure. Kai's panting arrival and pack-drop apply relational crucible, forcing instructive micro-choices that earn closure endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via sensory buildup from tasting air to humming dust motes, culminating in charged poise RR as greenhouse glows with seed-cost "lodged... behind her breastbone." One tightening via alignment light suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse and cracked panes constrain pruning/planting choices, with alignment columns catalyzing central bed action; final glow through panes charges image, mirroring internal warmth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to revive greenhouse tightens via seed-swallow deepening knowledge pathways, forcing prune-now under slipping moons; cost in Kai's "small betrayal" feel and lodged seed forecloses decay path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gentle rebellion emerges organically from pruning dead stems and choosing laughter-future taste; final "quiet refusal... promise" image reweights ruins-to-beauty without moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with taste-biased perceptual signature; Ariel's "Hurry is the only courtesy we owe the dead" dialogue distinct from Kai's poetic reply, carrying subtext and advancing pruning beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in lines like "Flavors bloomed... bright fish through dark water" integrates sensory propulsion without loops or muddle; rhythm varies to peak hum, zero artifacts touch closure glow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Memory-tasting chef reviving drowned greenhouse via synaptic seed under moons synthesizes fresh rebirth angle; risks poetic voice and alignment ritual heighten stakes coherently to rooted glow.</comment>
