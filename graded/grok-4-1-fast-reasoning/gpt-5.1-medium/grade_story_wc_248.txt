<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—burning to protect but erasing truth—and final renunciation of destruction for preservation is earned by discoveries with embodied remorse cleaving the chest. Interiority concrete and particular, traits like analytic intuition shown through intuitive pattern-following. No unearned epiphanies; flaws compound via past mistake driving present quest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density of vandalized objects builds to tapestry CR, reweighting past fire as loss with legible cost in "chest cleave open with remorse." Orientation anchored early in reaching archive; one tightening via self-portrait recognition narrows to well descent. Closure on-page with undeniable conceptual price of shifted preservation path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via descent into well, fingers scraping stone, charging final suspended image; body as micro-setting limits access to tapestry. Sensory selective: soot-tasting air, lantern-swinging passages reflect intuitive urgency. Vivid, purposeful details mirror internal states without overt symbolism, evolving with discoveries.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to rescue promise signaled early, escalates accumulatively through trail-tightening to self-portrait shock and tapestry reveal, driven by protagonist's intuitive agency. Cost unmistakable in remorse-awe reconfiguration foreclosing destructive path. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise of staying to build new trail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of preservation via "wound into script" emerges organically from trail events, final image resonantly reweighting burning as error without moralizing. Complexity in violence-as-emphasis invites ambiguity; protagonist arc inextricable from question of honoring stories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "patterns feel like memories my body has not yet lived," stable single POV with biased noticing via intuition. Rhythmic control modulates reflective density to pressure in well descent; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances pattern or revelation, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful and pattern-taught (e.g., "ribs were doors"), varying rhythm suits emotional cadence without overwriting in peak suspension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist redemption via ancient art trail transforms tropes through intuitive pattern-reading and conceptual shift from fire to stitching. Risk in mosaic discoveries heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight in self-portrait echo.</comment>
