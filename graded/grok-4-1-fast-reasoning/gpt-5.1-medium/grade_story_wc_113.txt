<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority shines in musician's particular perceptions of blots as "improvisations half-remembered from a nightmare rehearsal," rooting motivation in traits like chasing rumors amid unemployment; final acceptance of the score feels earned through embodied progression from pretense to bowing. Contradictory impulses act in scene via skepticism yielding to compulsion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly in single-scene build from thread of water to pooling tide and realization of pauses as code, landing Charged Poise closure when he raises instrument above dark water with undeniable immersion cost; orientation anchored early in flooded house.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Flooded opera house with flickering lanterns constrains choices (wading to podium, snatching floating program) and charges final image of instrument above water; sensory details like "crystal prisms clinking like distant, uneasy chimes" filter through musician's ear, evolving causally with rising tide.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unravel ghost code signaled early and deepens accumulatively via blot-notes to pause realizations, narrowing to endurance of mutinous music; agency in tracing/humming forces trade-off of rational pretense for commitment, with water's rise as felt cost charging poised ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of rebellion in silences/refusals emerges organically from dissonant phrases refusing resolution, resonating in final non-literal image of wordless shared play; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in unresolved chords mirroring coded insults.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in musical metaphors ("notes hung in between spaces"); rhythmic control modulates from hushed observation to crescendo in "ghost's rebellion waited, patient," heightening pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via layered images like "lanternlight quivering on the ink," rhythm varies read-aloud with no loops or scaffolds; purposeful metaphors ("trapdoor" chords) cohere without muddle, even in peak realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of water damage as ghostly score transforms ghost trope into textural rebellion, risking lyric compression that pays off in inevitable final poise; fresh angle on music-as-mutiny feels memorable and organic.</comment>
