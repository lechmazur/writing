<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied textures (rope roughness, metallic blood taste) reveals contradictory impulses toward old name and new erasure; final renunciation on poison label earned by layered fragments, with visible cost of dispersed self.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of overheard fragments builds to pattern break at container voice calling name ("syllables struck like hail"), yielding CR closure via new certificate with pending death and blank name—cost legible in unfinished identity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Port containers and tides as micro-setting constrain walks and listening ("timed his walks... rhythm of tides"); poison label recurs to charge final image, mirroring internal erasure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of memories vs. erasure) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to voice overhead forcing trade-off; agency in endurance/renunciation forecloses old identity with felt cost in blank-line certificate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Erased histories theme emerges organically from collecting/layering fragments; final blank-line certificate offers resonant CR answer to identity question, reweighting layers as accumulation beyond archives.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters reality through "misfiled forms and overheard breaths"; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, stable close third-person POV enhances textural immersion without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful layering metaphors (no muddle, pattern-taught); minor figurative density in dawn walk but propels to closure image of "port shuffled and sighed," rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic erasure and port-archivist premise transforms identity tropes; risk in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, blank-line certificate heightens stakes organically.</comment>
