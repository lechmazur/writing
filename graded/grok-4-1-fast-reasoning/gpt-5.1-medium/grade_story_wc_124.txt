<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory caution and pull toward memory culminate in earned grief at "For the first time... he let the wave hit," with embodied tears as visible cost; Mara's pressure sharpens his micro-choices; backstory anchors without flattening present drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as scent threads intensify revelation to Charged Poise closure ("tomorrow gather, tentative but possible") with emotional cost legible in tears and vial's color shift; orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene causality tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details like "condensation glitter along her cheekbones" and stall lanterns constrain choices (UV lamp under counter) and charge final image (tears as "tiny stars"); POV-biased micro-setting (Aron's lamp) mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory confrontation signaled early escalates via scent anchoring feet and personal script revelation, forcing endurance with on-page tear cost; agency in UV activation narrows options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory's impact emerges from scent-triggered grief and dual transformations (vial green, shoot emerges), reweighting caution via final image without statement; subtext in Mara's plea echoes Elias organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (scent-tinged fears) and rhythmic modulation under stress; dialogue subtextual ("Safer is the only kind") advances stakes; no head-hopping, voice distinct between characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but figurative density ("lanterns trembling like captive moons") borders overwriting in opening without full pattern payoff, slightly dulling early momentum; no loops, rhythm varies, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scent-memory tech and UV-handwriting reveal transforms tropes organically; risk in poetic conceit heightens emotional stakes, culminating in dual bloom payoff inevitable from setup.</comment>
