<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maro's characterization shines through embodied details like folding his soldier past into conducting gestures and noticing breath tremors; students' barricades create crucible pressure. Minor slip: Dari and Ilan verge on archetypal without deeper micro-choices distinguishing them. Final placement of zither earns relational shift with cost in their hovering fingers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via weekly rehearsals, holds to Charged Poise closure in the tentative chord between Dari and Ilan. Orientation anchored by ~100 words (hill, library, Maro). One tightening: chairs shrink and glances lengthen, reweighting stake with silences as cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zither rosette recurs to constrain circle and charge final lamplight image, mirroring internal softening; velvet walls and rain ticking guide listening via dimmed sensory space. Spatial choreography clear despite group; autumn frost quiets echoes purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging voices) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via dissonances resolving into multi-part songs with cracks/silences as felt cost. Agency in Maro's subtraction method and students' pauses narrows options toward harmony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patient unlearning emerges organically from shrinking spaces and weighted silences, answered non-literally in final chord's bridge-like hold without moralizing. Subtext in "not forgiveness yet" embraces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Maro POV with perceptual signature in "traveled stillness" and biased notice of enemy breaths; poetic rhythm modulates from fraught silence to gentle resonance. Minimal dialogue natural and subtextual ("only when you feel there is space").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (long swells to short stings); purposeful figurative coherence like "soundhole rosette showed seven interlocking hands" without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; final line recharges rosette motif propulsively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-war choir as vanishing arts crucible transforms reconciliation trope via border-born songs and rosette's hands. Risky lyric accumulation heightens quiet stakes organically.</comment>
