<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Priest's motivation to unravel stillness via music/theology compels homily micro-choices that earn demon's release; contradictory impulses (not drag out but ask why) act in scene with embodied conviction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds as looped chord builds lattice, demon's laugh feeds back as percussion, rhetorical questions tighten to RR closure where demon slips free with chapel's contraction as felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ultramarine pigment constrains spirit's fracture theory, drawn on brows to glow with remembered attention, charging identity stakes; chapel's dust and rafters ground sensory hierarchy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake to exorcise via illuminating assumptions deepens through priest's agency in paradoxes ("empty yet harvest-rich"), narrowing demon's options to shuddering release with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final uncoiling reweights premise: solidity (possession/logic) admits seams when assumptions named, emergent from looped rhetoric without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in music metaphors ("chords stretch until almost speech"); dialogue subtextual, priest's idiom distinct from demon's murmur.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density in lines like "every sentence snagged on a mirror... every assertion tangled," rhythmic variety propels without loops or muddle in peak homily.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Loop pedal-rhetoric synthesis transforms exorcism trope into inevitable pattern where demon's contradictions mirror sound lattice, bold risk heightens closure coherence.</comment>
