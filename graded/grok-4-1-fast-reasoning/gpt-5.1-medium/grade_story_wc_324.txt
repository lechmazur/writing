<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eren's persistent curiosity compels protocol defiance in dialing Deniz, embodying contradictory duty vs ache; final heroism renunciation earned by signal pulls and photo tilt, with caseload cost visible early.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as hearing aid density builds from ticks to unsent plea delivery, landing Charged Poise CR in "incidental heroism" naming; cost legible in exhaled weight and rule-bend at phone call.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hearing aid constrains pulls to apartment/photo/phone, charging final cry image; mist-hush sensory weave mirrors echoes without catalog, POV-filtered via pulses and cabbage smells.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tracing deepens via curiosity into protocol-risky delivery, tightening options at ajar door and blinking phone; agency in call forecloses filing, woman's cry viscerally pricing it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Forgiveness plea and photo laughter reweight bureaucratic echoes into heroism without moral; final image of thin cry answers listening's cost non-literally, emergent from pulses and curiosity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual echo-bias ("cracked plastic oracle") stable in single POV, rhythm compressing at signal peaks; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual in assurance and intro to Deniz.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels hush-to-cry arc with varied rhythm/openings; "paper-thin skin, eyes fixed beyond" embodies precisely, no loops or muddled figs dulling phone closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Hearing aid for dead pulses transforms tracer trope into textured lyric heroism; risk in poetic compression inevitable in hindsight, heightening quiet stakes organically.</comment>
