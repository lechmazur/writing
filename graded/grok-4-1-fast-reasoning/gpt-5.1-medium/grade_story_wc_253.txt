<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Performer's contradictory impulses—blank face masking quiet rebellion—act in scene via whittling and narration, earning Mara's slight easing as closure with surveillance cost. Interiority concrete in "break the law in the smallest, quietest way." Distinct voices in sparse dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density from spoon-stir to whittling culminates in Charged Poise closure ("remade hush like contraband") with conceptual sedition cost legible in final line. Oriented early; single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Turbines constrain choices via surveillance/thudding, charging final hush; pine/knife as micro-setting enable whittling turn. Sensory integration vivid ("shadows sliding over the cracked yard"). POV-filtered, purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lightness in grief vs. Mandate) signaled early, textural escalation via whittling deepens pressure, narrowing to endurance with report risk cost. Agency in performer's micro-choices; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of prohibited grief-hush emerges organically from particulars; wooden hybrid cradled by bouquet offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting Mandate without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on performer with distinct perceptual signature ("spoon sank... like a slow comet"); rhythmic prose modulates tension. Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven ("they will see a State Joy Amplifier").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm ("curl of wood falling like a quiet syllable"); no loops, purposeful figurative layering without muddle. Propulsion clear in peak whittling beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Mandate dystopia via whittling hush transforms joy-enforcement trope; risk-taking in quiet rebellion heightens stakes organically.</comment>
