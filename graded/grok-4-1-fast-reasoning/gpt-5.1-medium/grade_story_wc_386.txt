<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marek's interior pressure from sister's loss and careful weaving of truth compel his revelation; woman's flinch and tears show contradictory endurance with embodied cost. Final choice earned by dream analysis tying past to present.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: dream cameos density builds to CR closure in woman's frozen tears and flaring candles, reweighting family legacy with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early in shrine; one tightening via surname recognition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glacier shrine constrains entry ("throat swallowing candlelight") and charges closure (candles flare on ice walls); recurring ice/candle reflections mirror windows, filtering through Marek's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ghost child's plea) deepens accumulatively via surname link, narrowing woman's options to exposure; agency in her unflinching cry forecloses denial with felt emotional cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truths needing "living hearts as rafts" emerges via globe/dreams; final image of crystalline tears freezing reconfigures wreckage-salvage without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (breath on glass, fogged realities); dialogue subtextual ("Who then, the woman whispered"), natural rhythm distinguishes voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short crystalline drops vs. creaking glacier); purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle, propelling to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diver dreams and glacier ghosts transforms ghost tropes; risk in lyric accumulative drive inevitable in hindsight via globe reprise.</comment>
