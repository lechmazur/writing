<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority shines in embodied echoes "stir[ring], restless as birds in winter reed," with contradictory job loyalty versus personal quest acting in the writing scene; architect's tremor reveals shared loss, earning the uncoiling change with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of images (nest, echoes, thread) builds to Charged Poise closure in "something uncoil inside me, a slackening of invisible knots," reconfiguring inner archive with emotional cost legible on page; single scene oriented early at arrival, no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration like "smells of wet stone and lotus milk" and oculus "like a healing wound" filters through narrator's bias, constraining cross-legged writing and charging final light sheets on stone as mirror.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of writing connective letter signaled early tightens accumulatively via architect's tremor and stirring echoes, forcing integrative choice with visible inner cost; agency in spreading fragments and composing narrows options to personal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unseen threads emerges organically from nest, letters, and silver strand, offering resonant non-literal answer in final slackening without moralizing; subtext in "not love, or not only love" lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in lines like "mist... settle on my tongue" sustains rhythmic control under reflective pressure; dialogue carries subtext ("Every path needs a seed") with natural idiom distinction; stable first-person with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors taught early (e.g., rings from drops), no loops or artifacts dulling closure image of uncoiling knots; read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostwritten echoes into temple monument transforms tropes via nest-seed frame and thread motif, risking lyric compression that heightens stakes in final personal payoff.</comment>
