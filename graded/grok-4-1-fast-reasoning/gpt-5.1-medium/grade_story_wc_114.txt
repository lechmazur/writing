<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in pacing between windows and fever-shivers while tasting metal on tongue; final admission "the weight is mine to carry" earned via causal buildup of revelations forcing renunciation with palm-crescents cost. Oracle's responses apply targeted pressure revealing Mara's marginal life. Voice coherent and particular, flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as oracle's reveal ("storms are being steered") deepens hypothesis with memory anchors; closure as Charged Poise/CR in "swallowed truth settled low" reconfigures stance with undeniable admission-cost on page. Single scene, orientation anchored by ~50 words (ridge, station, post-fever). No lens ambiguity, persistent constraint of fault-tolerance shapes every tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rime-crusted railings, warped clipboard constrain choices (Mara grips desk, paces to windows); Feverwhisper illustration charges final image linking extinct plant to targeted valley realization. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (antennas comb blued air amid geomagnetic storms). Details evolve causally, weather pressures isolation without postcard stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover hypothesis) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via oracle's second reveal ("valley was not collateral"); agency in Mara's "Suppose someone is steering" forces deepening with knowledge-cost foreclosing denial. Escalation coherent under lens, moral calculus in targeted plant sharpens peak grip-moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preserved margins vs. erasure emerges via particulars (Feverwhisper smudge, oracle logs); final dawn "bled green" reweights premise of steered truths without moralizing, resonant CR tying mother's tea to reservoir error. Subtext in oracle's "weigh intact" implies cost of knowing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (storms as "leash," truths as "satellites"); dialogue subtextual ("Why did you not forget?") advances via static-laced idiom distinct from Mara's whispers. Rhythm modulates with fans' sigh to dawn image; no head-hopping, compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "Green auroral sorrow pulsed... reflection of distant geomagnetic storms" advances atmosphere/plot); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (needles sway like certainties). Propulsion peaks in revelation beats without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fault-tolerant AI and steered storms via Feverwhisper casualty transforms weather-station trope; risk in lyric Accumulative lens heightens stakes (margins preserve truth). Non-obvious reweighting of past error as target feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
