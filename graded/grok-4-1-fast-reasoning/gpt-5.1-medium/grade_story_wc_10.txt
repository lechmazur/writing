<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied in felt vibrations through ribs and numb fingers; contradictory grief/wonder impulses act in profile tests, earning final resolve to make body first instrument. Flaw of bewilderment yields to purpose without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of memory, tests, and monitors builds to Charged Poise closure in crystallized plan; cost legible in "wrecked and waterlogged" body as instrument. Orientation anchored by paragraph 2; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory and equipment constrain choices (sensor-gloves, actuator rig power tests); city fires outside mirror internal smolder, filtered through tuning past. Recurring cold glass charges final tactile resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to combat silence deepens via profile tests narrowing bewilderment to tactical plan under accumulative lens; agency in micro-choices like Grief 1 actuation forecloses passive survival with body-cost. One tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of marvels enduring silence emerges organically via heat-maps to vibrations; final image of city orchestras reweights Quiet premise non-literally, lingering with unshaken hope amid catastrophe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases to conductor's tactile vibrations over absent sound; rhythmic prose modulates from hush to surging colors without filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (fires like poppies, forks dance) coherent and propulsive; varied syntax breathes with awakening to tests, zero loops or scaffolds dulling closure vibration image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Quiet physics, heat-emotion mapping to bone-felt symphonies transforms apocalypse trope; risk of lyric vibration premise inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
