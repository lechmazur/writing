<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Solitary Lio's interiority shines in concrete embodiments like "small dark crab skittering in his thoughts" and contradictory cheer in "bright sort of sorrow"; final endurance of "familiar ache" earned by prior unease and vow. Micro-choices under pressure (netting foam, following seeds) reveal values hierarchy. No slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from foam blanks to seed-trail discovery, culminating in on-page CR ("postponed" realization reweights erasures) with legible cost in "soft laugh that echoed strangely, half-mirth and half-mourning." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via conjecture suffices. Cost proof: final ledger symbols foreclose erasure fear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Geode setting constrains choices (seeds "trickled down a narrow tunnel," unfinished crystal reveals truth) and charges final image (emerges with seeds on boots). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: sigils via crater glass, crystals "humming with...dissonance." No white-room; evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths vanish) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern of blanks to conjecture-deepening; agency in following seeds narrows options. Cost unmistakable in ache of half-formed things, charging poised continuance. Closure under lens intact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of postponed incompleteness emerges organically from particulars (vanishing paths as "tucking...into gentle erasures"); final whisper to sea and "Not yet, but soon" offers resonant reweighting without moral. No preaching; ambiguity in "trusting him to keep watch" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice consistent with perceptual signature (tidal metaphors like "dry surf of recollection"); rhythm modulates (humming builds to echoing laugh). Single POV stable, no elision issues; prose as character reflects cheerful gloom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "Colors flared, then condensed into looping sigils" advances plot, reveals tool, embodies emotion). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle in peak (tunnel discovery).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sea-foam memories + crater glass + postponed paths transforms fantasy into inevitable logic of "unborn roads." Risky lyric fantasy heightens stakes via geode's indecision; no template echoes.</comment>
