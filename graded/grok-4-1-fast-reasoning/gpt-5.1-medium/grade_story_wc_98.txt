<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of pride straining against fear act vividly in the dream confrontation with the tree; final endurance of doubt earns potential renunciation of small certainty with embodied chest-pooling cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds as dream density reweights origins via tree's "your story does not," landing CR closure with conceptual cost of admitting prior loss, taught early by island signs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ridge and seed constrain vigil choice and charge final dream image; "flowers...closed as he passed" mirrors internal hesitation, filtering through Kael's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake tightens via agency in dream entry, forcing "small and sure" vs. "stretch...lost" trade-off; cost unmistakable in "luminous doubt pool in his chest."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image of pooled doubt offers non-literal answer to memory's bounds, reweighting records vs. dreams through particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature in "light felt honest yet unfinished" biases noticing whimsically; stable close third modulates rhythmically to dream intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; "luminous doubt" recurrence pattern-taught avoids loops, though minor figurative density in opening tests ear without closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dormant seed-origin synthesis transforms memory tropes into empirical dream-test, risking open CR that heightens cultural stakes organically.</comment>
