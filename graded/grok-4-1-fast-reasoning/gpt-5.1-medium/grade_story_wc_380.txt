<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete notebook and ritual micro-choices under rising suspicion; contradictory impulses from laughing at father's omens to embracing them earn the final experiment. Embodied cost in "breath slowing as though my chest had been filled with wet sand" reveals values. Minor reflective summaries don't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of disturbances (lanterns, crystals, lost days) tightens to pattern break in coffee grounds spirals. CR closure lands in final flashes of memories with conceptual cost of glimpsed but trapped silt. Orientation anchored early in harbor/whale night.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Salt crystals and father's cup constrain ritual choice and charge final humming image. Sensory selection (souring flesh, shuddering tide, mineral sting) reflects POV urgency. Whale flank mirrors internal troughs without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (probe memory leaks) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via notebook patterns to decisive ritual tightening options. Agency in pouring grounds forces CR stance; cost legible in thickened air and stunned fish circling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of gravity's forgetting emerges organically from particulars; final spirals reweight premise with resonant CR answer—memories circling in pockets—without moralizing. Father's slurry constellations shift from omen to tool via struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature ("fire folded inward," "tiny pockets of gravity nesting") biases toward omens; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in hummed silence. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors cohere (tide marks spiraling inward) without muddle in peak ritual. Varied syntax accelerates from lantern failures to final hum; zero loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of beached whale, gravity pockets, and coffee divination transforms omen trope into inevitable CR. Risky lyric accumulation heightens conceptual stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
