<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's tranquilly perceptive trait drives embodied micro-choices like tracing gaps with the stamp as compass; internal doubt ("peaceful, or sedated") acts simultaneously with resolve, earning folio discovery as conceptual renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density from blackout hush to folio testimonies; CR closure reweights curation premise with conceptual cost in "unapproved yet unmistakably true" origins.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drowned towers and still water constrain stack navigation, mirroring Mara's dappled resolve; mineral-stained aisle charges mis-shelved folio discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Suspicious gaps signal dominant stake early, tightening via blackout-enabled pursuit to revelation that forecloses democratic ark myth with undeniable narrative cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Folio's hillside testimonies reweight premise of survived intentions non-literally, emerging from erasures without moralizing; complexity lingers in curation's biased origins.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature ("read spines the way other people read faces") modulates rhythmically to charged poise in final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors ("blackout fell like velvet over rust"); minor figurative density in stacks passage avoids closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sunken archive's curated gaps synthesize flood-era moral calculus originally, transforming ark trope; folio payoff feels inevitable from established absences.</comment>
