<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pacifist vow hardens through embodied temptations in immersions ("seductions of violence"); weight shifts reveal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final hope-driven endurance forecloses violent paths with felt cost of metabolized shadow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via immersive density building to cadence shift; CR closure lands on-page in "fabric of probability yielded with a slow, aching sound," reweighting denial-sealed timeline with conceptual scar-tissue cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Body as micro-setting constrains via weight shifts enabling panel reaches or anchoring; archive photos and Tear recur, charging immersions; ghostly atmosphere filters through AI's tear-reading sensors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (open dimension via pacifist shadow metabolism) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through temptations tightening options; final tree-planting immersion forces joyful crystallization with ship-enabling cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of compassion redirecting shadow emerges implicitly from immersions; final "stubborn hope" image offers non-literal answer to denial's lock, reweighting violence's seduction without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tear-shimmer readings and weight embodiment; rhythmic prose modulates with emotional gravity, stable first-person POV with lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with metaphors cohering around gravity/shadow (no muddle); varied rhythm propels without loops; figurative pattern taught early pays off in closure's "aching sound."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original gravity-emotion synthesis and tear-mediated immersions transform pacifist AI premise; risky lyric structure heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in hope yielding scar-tissue door.</comment>
