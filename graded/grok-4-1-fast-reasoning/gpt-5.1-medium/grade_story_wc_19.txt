<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Child's contradictory impulses—claustrophobia vs. uprooted freedom—embody throughout, culminating in earned shared stasis during inversion; father's unclenching shoulders reveal relational shift under pressure. Doll use and exposure limits as micro-choices hierarchize values with cost. Voice distinct in dialogue ("sprout" vs. child's poetic perception).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence density builds to Charged Poise RR in shared inversion, with legible cost ("fear flickered...no soil here"). Orientation anchored by ~100 words (trellis, bunkers, inversions). Single scene with anchored shards; no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Trellis and doll constrain choices (clipping, balancing, drifting) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (silence "flavors," metallic brightness) reflects child's bias. Western/eastern struts differentiate specificity without catalog. Doll's crack mirrors fault lines in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fear vs. silence acceptance) signaled early, tightens via shared inversion agency; cost felt in father's vulnerability and child's flickering fear. Escalation as density increase reweights options under Textural lens; one decisive deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence as changeable orchard emerges organically from particulars (doll resonance, beam hushes); final "shared vocabulary...sprouting quietly" offers non-literal CR repricing bunkers' purpose without moralizing. Doll's drift recharges inversion motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (tasting silences, air's "stretching contracted tone") biases noticing; voice modulates rhythmically under inversion stress. Dialogue subtextual ("You cannot collect nothing") advances goal; stable first-person with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varying rhythm (short inversion breaths vs. reflective pools); metaphors coherent (silence as "gold leaf," "orchard") without muddle, taught early as pattern. Minor synonym churn in silences ("hush," "quiet") but serves texture; no loops dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inversions, silence collection, and reversed claustrophobia transforms tropes; risk in lyric texture heightens stakes. Doll's "delayed embrace" and shared unbound moment feel inevitable, non-obvious.</comment>
