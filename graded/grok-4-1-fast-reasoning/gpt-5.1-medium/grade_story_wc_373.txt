<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied contradictions like "desire and fear were two sides of the same jar," compelling the final endurance of pain as "river water through a fresh cut." Final renunciation of ignorance earned through prior micro-choices under pressure. Voice specificity distinguishes via moonshine-rooted metaphors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from market navigation to fob activation, culminating in Charged Poise closure where Loretta stays "collecting them like jars," with legible cost in staggering and muffled regret. Orientation anchored early via pilings and stalls. One tightening via failed first ask suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pier's "sagging boards and whispered barters" and "soft underfoot" planks constrain movement to old woman, mirroring internal settling in "gentle rot." Sensory hierarchy (lantern dim, rope-voice) reflects Loretta's priorities. Final image charges via hush truce extension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture trust's break signaled early, escalates texturally via fob's false start narrowing to revelation of "tiny pause," forcing endurance with on-page cost in "staggered, clutching... as if it burned." Agency in whispering true name and persisting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden bruises emerges via particulars like jars and duffel pause, reweighting in final "unease settled... like company she had chosen" without moralizing. Resonance inextricable from arc: knowledge costs innocence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in jar/knife/still metaphors reflects moonshine heritage; dialogue subtextual ("nobody spends that much to hear what they already know"). Stable close-third POV; rhythm modulates from calm survey to muffled intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figures like "smoked glass that... swallowed them"; rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Peak revelation crisp: "tiny pause before his knuckles tapped the duffel."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism in moonshine world: fob plays "sound of trust breaking" as pause, transforming betrayal trope via specific memory snag. Risky lyric poise inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
