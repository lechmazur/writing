<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied reactions like "sight knocked the air from her" reveal sculptor-specific priorities; final renunciation of blue-line navigation earned through layered micro-choices under isolation pressure. Contradictory lost/learning impulses act in scene without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density tightening to CR closure in "tucking away not an artifact but a question"; legible cost in chest-knock moment and foreclosed linear path reconfigures lost premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Storm archway as micro-setting constrains pulls toward box and charges final "gatehouse" image; sensory hierarchy (spray prisms, wind stings) reflects sculptor's tactile bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake of lost navigation deepens texturally via slide's self-vision narrowing options to "sideways" reimagining; agency in prizing/holding slide forces trade-off with visible emotional cost, though slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of alliances/scaffolds emerges organically from slide particulars, reweighted non-literally in final van-turn image without moralizing; complexity lingers in perpetual hard learning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (driftwood "ribs," "altar") biases noticing; rhythmic texture modulates from reverie hum to pulsing heartbeat under vision stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("decades stacked like geological layers" coherent with pattern); minor figurative density in slide beat ("fibers twisting into rope") purposeful without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh magic-slide synthesis transforms lost-coast trope into time-alliance premise; risk of lyric CR pays off in hindsight via sculptor's reimagined scaffolds.</comment>
