<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Narrator's truthfulness compels raw admissions like dreaming "from the eye outward," earning collaboration with Risa; contradictory desire for safety amid risk drives micro-choices in mapping; Risa's heart-chords add crucible pressure without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from setup to storm-night CR where eye clears as "mirror we had agreed to fear," reconfiguring terror with exposure cost; orientation anchors ravine/orchard early; single scene with backstory interleaving holds to charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Hanging orchard's swaying pods and storm-battered cables constrain access/work, mirroring internal porosity; recurring eye "occluding the tiny reflection of my own face" charges final image; sensory bias (groaning orchard, iron taste) filters through truthful forager's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map mood-absorbing truffles) signaled early, tightens via Risa collaboration under lens for one deepening; agency in shared tracing forces endurance with fear surges; storm peaks pressure but cost legibility peaks at eye's plain surface.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of buffered vs. bearable empathy emerges via fungal veins "stitching... mood to mood," reweighted in final "practicing seeing one another and surviving"; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in "fractured grace"; protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in truthful, embodied noticing ("truth sheared out... in sharp strips"); dialogue subtextual, Risa's laugh "cracking... letting light through" advances; POV stable, rhythm modulates from descriptive to exposed praxis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("cables bit into the rock like nervous ligaments") but minor overwriting in storm ("slow and electric, orchard groaned"); no loops, varied rhythm propels to closure image; sensory propulsion clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empathy virus, mood-truffles, eye-relic transforms tropes into "fungal lace" buffering; risk in porous world logic heightens stakes organically; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
