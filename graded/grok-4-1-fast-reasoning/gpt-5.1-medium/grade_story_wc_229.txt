<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in grandmother's legacy and sea's "please," with embodied "screaming tenderness" driving micro-choice at lens; contradictory impulses (pride denial) yield earned change in Jorah's reaction. Final stance forecloses shouting path with relational cost legible in his softened eyes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably: scent braids with pulse into lens, culminating in Charged Poise RR where soft beam beckons boats sans horn; cost felt in sea's prior "please" and forgiven exhaustion, reshaping options on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse lens and cooling rail constrain intent conduction, charging final beam; sensory hierarchy (scent over sight) mirrors POV urgency post-heat wave, with mist "like breath easing from a feverish chest" evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whispers > shouts) signaled early, tightens via scent application yielding boat response; agency in whispered intent forecloses horn-reliance, with sea's sluggishness as felt price charging Jorah's whisper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of gentle intent emerges organically via vial-to-beam arc, resonant non-literal answer in "asked it to forgive us, and to come home safe" reweighting shouts without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with biased perceptual signature (vibrations, scents as intent carriers); voice modulates poetically yet precisely, distinguishing Mara's texture from Jorah's "cursed at a stubborn hinge."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere in night garden pattern ("watered earth, moonlit stone"), propelling rhythm to peak beam without overwriting in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh scent-magic synthesis transforms lighthouse trope via "vibrations of intent," with risk-taking in textural closure heightening stakes organically; irreplaceable vial lens payoff feels inevitable.</comment>
