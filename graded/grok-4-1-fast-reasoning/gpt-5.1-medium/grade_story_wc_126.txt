<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elio's motivation to seek unfinished resonance compels micro-choices like hesitant phrases and culminates in earned bowl inversion, with contradictory impulses embodied in stalled bow work; Mara's presence forces relational shift without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as resonant density builds from harbor hush to greenhouse pumps, delivering Charged Poise closure in "He picks up the mendicant's bowl, empties the coins... leaves it upside down beside the pumps" with conceptual cost of renouncing asking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken orchard greenhouse with swaying diving suits constrains playing experiment and mirrors internal search, charging final pump-murmur and scarred sapling image; selective acoustic details filter through Elio's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking audible beauty in hush tightens accumulatively via Mara's card and pump revelation, narrowing to stance crystallization; agency in playing and bowl act forecloses mendicant path with legible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unfinished beauty emerges organically from unbound notes, scarred saplings, and pump cycles, answered non-literally by "the world is still beginning" and inverted bowl without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with acoustic perceptual signature sustains biased noticing of resonances; rhythmic syntax modulates hush density without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High-density lines like "notes lean toward cadences and then unbind themselves" vary rhythm and integrate motifs without loops or muddled metaphors; propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-burn acoustic hush, diving-suit saplings, and unbound playing transforms lyric motifs into inevitable conceptual shift at bowl inversion.</comment>
