<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orren's underachievement vividly embodied in specific failures like "set water on fire"; contradictory fear of falling acts simultaneously with keystone impulse in final step, earning renunciation of safe archive life with felt cost of isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as keystone warmth/luminance density builds to mist step (Charged Poise closure reconfiguring failure into possibility); one tightening via tugging stair suffices, orientation anchored early in cell/workbench; cost legible in "familiar tilt in his balance."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Icebound spire's rime-sheathed stair and open arches constrain path to edge, charging final mist image; sensory hierarchy (chill biting, sourceless glow) filters through Orren's mage bias, selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape automated obscurity via keystone's whisper) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through pulsing warmth/tug to stance crystallization in mist step; agency in unstrapping/ascending forecloses safe radius with legible fear cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sacred simple vs. automated perfection emerges organically from engine's "perfect tales" contrasting keystone's "patient insistence"; final mist image resonantly reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "brilliant dimness," "clouds pulsed faintly with cityglow"; stable close-third POV with biased noticing (e.g., unfashionable mist walking from obsolete volume); rhythmic control heightens under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "keystone grew heavier, tugging his arm"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, precise verbs like "creaked like an old lung" integrate without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of failed mage tending automated archive, transformed by impossible keystone into mist-walking risk; bold icespire/mist premise commits fully, inevitable hindsight payoff in final step.</comment>
