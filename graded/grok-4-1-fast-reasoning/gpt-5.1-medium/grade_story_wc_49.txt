<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tinkerer's motivation to restore via songs without cruelties roots consistently in whimsical tools and ear-to-tree listening; interiority concrete in "alignment... people remembering how to stand," embodied in humming that steadies via vine. No deep contradictory impulses act simultaneously in pivotal coaxing beat, limiting 9+; villagers secondary without crucible pressure. Flawless competence balances with tentative note wavering before harmony.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tentative hum to thrum, gathering sighs, bowl filling as cadence shift reweights broken village stake. On-page RR closure in "tipped it gently over the roots... blossoms opening," with cost legible in "heavy with unsung memories" foreclosing silenced dissonance. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Verdant arbor sensory-selective (silver fog, moss paths, bark shiver) filters through tinkerer's priorities, constraining wait till "sky lightened from ink to watered milk." Arbor guides choices via tree-listening and root-pouring; charges final "leaves rustled... fruit swelled" image. No white-room; spatial choreography clear as people circle without crowding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore practices sans cruelties) signaled early, escalates accumulatively: solo hum → vine/arbor response → villager gathering → shared rhythm narrowing to bowl-pour under lens. Agency in melody shift braiding breaths; cost felt in tree sulking to straightening, foreclosing bitter fruit path. One tightening sufficient; no agency slip at climax pour.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of alignment via shared rhythm over laws emerges organically from song-weaving breaths and poured memories, reweighting "sacred practices" sans cruelty. Final "breathing in time... someone began to laugh through their tears" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Particulars (copper bowl, reed flutes) charge without overt symbolism; no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable, perceptual signature whimsical-sensory ("notes became a questionsong"); diction/rhythm lyrical yet legible, modulating from hush to thrum. No dialogue, so N/A; purposeful compression in leaf-stitched book pays to harmony. Voice distinct in syntax like "hush gather like cloth around his shoulders."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "hummed a tentative note... bark shiver" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting risk in metaphors ("watered milk," "small, deliberate dawn") but pattern-taught, coherent in lyric mode, untouching closure pour. Propulsion peaks clean at bowl-tip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tinkerer "spins golden stories" via sound-capturing bowl transforms folklore trope into song-soil restoration sans cruelty. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes in dawn-alignment; bowl/root climax inevitable from satchel unpack. No derivative echoes; particulars (glass seeds, clockwork roots) irreplaceable.</comment>
