<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio's traits (eloquent hands, seasonal muteness) root motivation and compel the cradle-carving choice with embodied silence as cost. Interiority particular via "thinking in intervals"; girl symbolic but pressures via gesture. No contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak tuning beat limits 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of images/textures builds to sculpture's shudder and chord release as Charged Poise/CR, reweighting wonder as transient. Orientation anchored by ~50 words ("whispering bluff," Lio tuning). Cost legible in "last warmth of speech leave his throat" amid singing tower.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bluff's "stone ribs humming" and altitude constrain shard placement, mirror Lio's silence, charge final image of combing symphonies. Sensory hierarchy (wind, glisten, chords) selective via Lio's tuner bias; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder) signaled early, textural escalation via tuning/shard/sun alignment deepens to chord that forecloses ownership ("not a color to be owned"). Agency in carving/setting; cost felt in tears/gravity and Lio's muteness. Single tightening sufficient, charges image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (wonder/truth via non-words) emerges from particulars (shard glisten → chord declaring transience); final image reweights premise without moral. Subtext in silence/gestures; no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited stable, perceptual signature in "measuring distance between hope and despair"; rhythmic modulation peaks at "sound unfurled... rearranged the furniture of the heart." No head-hopping; elision (world rules) taught early, paid in sculptures.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm; "muted vigor" motif purposeful, not loop. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("slow planets, colliding notes") during peak but coherent/payoff in chord; no scaffold in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kinetic truth-towers, iceberg wonder-shard transforms tropes; risk in lyric elision heightens resonance without gimmick. Final reconfiguration (singing preservation) inevitable from premise.</comment>
