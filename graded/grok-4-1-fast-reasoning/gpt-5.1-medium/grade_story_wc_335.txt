<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in Rhea's combative tenderness and Jun's defiance/scare, earning the final promise; "combative tenderness forged into a promise" reveals hierarchy of values with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from arrival to annotation/promise; Charged Poise closure crystallizes reversible exile with felt cost in "forgetting me will hurt" guarantee.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shattered mirrors and afternoon shadow constrain exile choice and charge final relational image; selective sensory details (dust glittering, steam coiling) filter through Rhea's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of Jun's reversible exile deepens via tea reading and demand for painful forgetting; agency in annotation forecloses finality, cost unmistakable in Rhea's blade-like smile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory's reversibility emerges implicitly through mirrors/tea leaves/dialogue; final "That, at least, I guarantee" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting fear without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (shadows "amused," leaves as "jagged constellations"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, with clean third-close stability.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (ink in water, drawn blade) propels without loops; rhythm varies naturally, zero scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tea-leaf geometry and shard-mirrors transforms memory tropes; risk in lyric texture heightens stakes organically to inevitable promise.</comment>
