<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Isera's disenchantment and dream-driven compulsion shine through embodied refusals like ignoring lords for the climb, with contradictory duty impulses acting in her softly commanding dismissal of Ralen. Final remembrance feels earned by mounting dream pressure. Minor slip: some traits like "disenchanted" told early without initial micro-choice revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dream motifs and journey density build to grotto's CR closure ("Isera remembered"), reweighting identity with sky's fate cost via on-page visions. Orientation anchors early (queen in palace). One tightening at grotto entry suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto's "dark soot" edges and "starlight dripped... each drop a tiny wound" constrain entry and charge final visions, with sensory metal taste and thin air mirroring urgency. Sky as "enormous, listening ear" evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent sky bleed via dreams) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through storm defiance and grotto visions narrowing to remembrance. Agency in "No... We climb now" forecloses duty path with relational cost to Ralen.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of buried identity vs. role emerges organically from bleeding starlight and "true name... sharp enough to cut," resonating in final visions without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from dream mystery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias ("sky... muttering in a language made of wind") modulates under pressure, stable single-POV. Dialogue subtextual: Ralen's "wary" reply reveals status without declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in "starlight dripped, not white but dark, each drop a tiny wound" propels without loops; metaphors purposeful and coherent. Minor overwriting in journey descriptions doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-prophecy and identity in "bleeding starlight" grotto visions transforms queen trope boldly. Risky lyric escalation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
