<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete micro-choices like pausing at the drawer and adapting to patients' flinches; final emotional twining of grief/gratitude earned by prior cautious exuberance. Contradictory impulses act in scene (unease vs. planning shared wonder). Mr. Alvarez/Lake apply relational pressure without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from morning tuning to eclipse hush/ring; CR closure in "grief and gratitude twine instead of clash" with legible emotional cost on final line. Orientation anchored early (rehab on Sage Ridge, Mara therapist). Single scene coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ash tree and courtyard constrain gathering/sharing, charging final "hush beneath dreaming roots"; light "ladders" and eclipse shadows evolve causally, mirroring internal states. Sensory hierarchy (pine/sage hum, wind combing leaves) filters through Mara's perceptual bias. Micro-setting (guitar, viewers) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nurture wonder amid anxiety) signaled early, tightens via eclipse cadence shift to hand-hold and vision; agency in stopping music forces stasis with emotional cost felt in memory opening. Under accumulative lens, hush reweights options undeniably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ordinary magic emerges organically from particulars (hair curl, eclipse ring, hand-hold); final image non-literally answers "wonder amid fear" by reweighting loss as shared gratitude. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "fragile minute."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (musical metaphors like "chords that rose and fell like breathing"); rhythmic control heightens hush pressure. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Lake's swear/laugh). No head-hopping; elision of backstory pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "light slanted through blinds in narrow ladders"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, figurative language purposeful (e.g., "oxygen tubing looping like a halo") without muddle in peak hush/ring. Zero scaffold in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eclipse as ordinary magic crucible, transforming rehab tropes via hair curl vision; risk in lyric accumulative build heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at "soft swirl... did not lance but open."</comment>
