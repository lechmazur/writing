<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotions like "water lapped at my calves as if reading Braille" revealing motives under pressure; final micro-choice to add notes earns renunciation of handlers' data mission with ideological cost. Contradictory impulses (loyalty to Ara vs. mission) act in scene via dice-following and journal-decoding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dice patterns and journal layers build density to CR closure: lab reconfigured as "heart choosing...to keep beating unseen" with conceptual cost of unseen endurance. Orientation anchors early in flooded corridor; single tightening at central chamber pays off without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details like "pipes creaked like old throats" and "silt and memory alike" constrain path via dice guidance and pressure the final liberation image. POV bias filters through acoustic patterns; setting evolves causally with settling groans mirroring internal rhythm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to liberate journals tightens accumulatively via dice-map and timed reading, narrowing to protagonist's note-adding agency; cost legible in foreclosed handler expectations and lab's hidden beat. Escalation driven by pattern-deepening under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of encrypting vulnerability emerges organically from journal ciphers and dance memories, reweighted in final image of lab's defiant heartbeat without moralizing; resonant CR answers "survive without becoming smaller."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature in acoustic rhythms ("every shadow moved with mysterious familiarity") modulates intensity consistently; purposeful compression taught early via dice pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "ink feathered into fractal shorelines" propels via rhythm, but slight figurative overload in peak decoding beat ("panic into probability") borders coherence without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic cryptography, dancing probability, and living lab transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric sci-fi frame heightens stakes via dice-oracle, inevitable in hindsight at "hidden heartbeat as guidance."</comment>
