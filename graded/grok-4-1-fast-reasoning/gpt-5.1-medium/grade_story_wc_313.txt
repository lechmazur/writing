<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between engineering vigilance and emotional pull of resurfacing memories act in scene via trail-following; final shift to storytelling earned by Mara's photo with visible cost in balanced "grief and duty." Exceptional embodiment avoids clichés.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: photo trail density increases knowledge, culminates in Charged Poise RR at "held up the photograph... and began," cost legible in "fragile as glass" hush. Single scene coherent, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Resurfacing rooftops/chimneys constrain trail-following choices; "mirrored hush" recurring motif charges final image contrasting neighbors' faces as "another kind of levee." Sensory selection POV-specific and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (hold structures vs. honor resurfacing stories) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via photos narrowing to Mara confrontation; agency in following/holding up photos forces trade-off with council pressure, cost in fragile communal hush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (stories as levees holding past) emerges organically from label/photos/resurfacing; final image non-literally reweights prior engineering focus without moralizing, resonant ambiguity in neighbors' silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in glint-noticing and rot-smelling; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in trail beats, diction biased toward structural/organic tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture or revelation; no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (e.g., "gray fingers") without muddle, varied rhythm passes read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drowned town trope via photo-trail epiphany transforming warden to storyteller; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
