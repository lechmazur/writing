<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dye master's motivation to magnetize stories roots in donor heart's flutter, embodied in tripping rhythm and iridescent caution; contradictory old/curious hearts act simultaneously. Patrons' distinct tales force micro-choices like questioning the woman. Earned realization confronts flaw of incuriosity with cost in rib pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observations, dialogues, wing-turn build to CR closure where mirrors-for-longing reweights magnet premise. Cost legible in "thinning some colors and deepening others" as riverwater image. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tea house slats/mist constrain perception and gather stories; wing as micro-setting charges final flare, mirroring internal sheen. Sensory hierarchy (clink underlined by heart) reflects dye-master bias. Details evolve causally with dusk blade.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (magnetize stories) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via patrons' tales narrowing to realization; agency in pouring/asking/showing wing forecloses incurious path. Cost unmistakable in chest pressure swelling to explosive caution at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of longing-mirrors emerges organically from patrons' spills and wing radiance refusing separation. Final bow reconfigures without moral, reweighting stories as reflections with oblique cost of borrowed wonder. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (watching as colors steep); voice modulates from cautious to luminous thud. Dialogue subtextual/natural (mouthed silence, migrating secrets); distinct idioms (child's balloons vs courier's birds).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line layers image/pressure (mica-trembling tea). Varied rhythm, no loops; metaphors coherent/patterned (wing flare, mist tendrils). Minor density in peak metaphors purposeful for lyric texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms transplant trope via lepidopterist wing/tea house magnet into mirrors-for-longing CR; fresh synthesis inevitable from particulars. Bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
