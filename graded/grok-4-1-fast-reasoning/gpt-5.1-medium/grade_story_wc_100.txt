<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's weariness embodied in "densely weary" and brittle voice under pressure, with contradictory protest ("I bury bodies, not cities") yielding to earned task acceptance that forecloses surface life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from package to descent via lens pull, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure in final line's "chased stillness finally paused," with undeniable conceptual cost of endless duty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Barnacled arches and impossible shelves constrain navigation and task, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (glow, pressure, bells) filters through Elias's undertaker gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of "permanent address" deepens texturally via librarian's reframing of unrested lives, forcing renunciation with felt cost in brittle realization and task embrace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rest as coordinate emerges organically from burial to shelving unrest, with final image reweighting premise non-literally—stillness paused amid uproar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature notices "shivered rainbows" and "books drifted like slow fish"; sparse dialogue subtextual ("rest has gone missing") advances reframing cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy descents amid long textured builds); no loops, metaphors cohere (sea as eye), propelling to charged closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker-duty with underwater library of unrested signals transforms lost-city trope; risk of surreal spaces inevitable from opening weariness.</comment>
