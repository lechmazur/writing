<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular (translating cries to brother's pleas); final choice to play voicemail earned by grief-rooted recoil and prior letters, with embodied cost in shaking hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds to firmware's cry (inciting) then voicemail play (RR/Charged Poise closure); cost legible in "hands shaking as if the meteors are dragging my bones toward the sky."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lab shelves sag with purposeful tools constraining actions (threading tapes, console drawer); amber as micro-setting charges final decision moment, mirroring suspended insect to trapped voices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush guilt's echoes) deepens via cry's translation tying firmware to brother; agency in fetching/playing voicemail under lens forecloses haunting with emotional price in recoil.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief as compressible echo emerges via firmware/brother's simulated infancy; final voicemail laugh reconfigures premise non-literally, reweighting trapped time with release cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (meteors mapped to tattoos); rhythmic control modulates from humming walls to quiet firmware, stable first-person POV with no leakage under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels (e.g., "The firmware has found a new frequency, and it is crying like a newborn whose first breath was code"); no loops, figurative coherence in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of haunted tech as remorse-compressor via tattooist/translator lens; risk of poetic density pays off in inevitable closure image of burning meteors.</comment>
