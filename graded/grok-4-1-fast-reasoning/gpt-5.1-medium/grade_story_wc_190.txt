<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rian's fluid logic and experiment motivation compel micro-choices like killing speakers; passengers' unknitting under monitor reveals embodied change with felt cost in foreclosed impatience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to RR/Charged Poise in "silence stopped being absence and became shared shelter"; blue line drop shows legible cost without decisive act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace and vial constrain experiment ("crystals feathered... permission"); final hush vaults to it, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of silence-as-comfort tightens via monitor's pressure on passengers; stillness forecloses noise with on-page cost in jaw unknotted and bird wound down.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence bridging emerges organically; final "bridge made of gentled breaths" reweights transit without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature on sounds/weather; voice's lyrical hush modulates seamlessly to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm; "blue line hovered near the floor, trembling like a held note" integrates without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm glass, noise monitor, prism transit transforms quiet experiment; hush-bridge feels inevitable from vial's early cue.</comment>
