<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lira's skepticism drives concrete micro-choices like gripping the kite string and sacrificing certainty at climax, embodying contradictory impulses with visible cost in her "painfully luminous" aftermath.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via anomaly trail tightening to box confrontation; RR closure lands on-page as Lira pours doubt, triggering city-wide release with her personal cost legible in final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fountains function as micro-setting constraining choices (reaching in unlocks progress) and charge final image (roaring back to life); sensory details like "air thickened with pressing silence" filter through Lira's doubt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate memories) escalates accumulatively from anomalies to fountain reversal to box demand for equal exchange; agency in sacrifice forecloses doubt-armor path with cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of doubt's forfeiture for collective memory emerges organically from pattern breaks and sacrifice; final image reconfigures skepticism as "open, painfully luminous" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (e.g., "doubts shone brighter than... faith"); rhythmic control heightens pressure in chamber scene without elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors (e.g., "constellations learning to walk"); no loops or scaffolds dull closure image of glass birds and roaring fountains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skeptic unstick-ing memories via tactile anomalies transforms loss tropes; risk in poetic surrealism (upward water, poured doubt) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
