<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via synesthetic embodiment of emotions as colors; contradictory impulses peak in kitchen memory surfacing dual betrayal, earning closure realization without tidy resolution. Final micro-choice to adjust filament reveals values hierarchy with self-acceptance cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of absences and prototypes builds to CR closure in prototype's song carrying "both betrayals at once and does not shatter me," reweighting premise with conceptual endurance cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sunken orchard and shipwrecks constrain dives and harvest, with ashen forge charging final test; sensory hierarchy (blue sloshing, hum) mirrors synesthetic POV, evolving via current and aurora without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture trust sound) signaled early, tightens via dual-betrayal deepening that forces endurance choice; cost legible in "does not shatter me" as traded self-forgiveness, under textural lens recharging prototype image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of repairable trust emerges via absences and colors, final image ("lacquer on a cracked instrument") non-literally reprices mutual breaking without moral; resonance from particulars like green mute, no false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("blue sounds like glass breathing") biases noticing, rhythmic syntax modulates from descriptive to compressed in realization; stable first-person with purposeful elision of partner backstory paid in present adjustment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "skeletal trunks grope through dim water" advances setting/action/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops, metaphors coherent and pattern-taught via colors; propulsion peaks in prototype tremble.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthesia fused with drowned forge and absence-collection transforms betrayal trope into fresh engineering pursuit; risk of lyric immersion heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in dual-sound realization.</comment>
