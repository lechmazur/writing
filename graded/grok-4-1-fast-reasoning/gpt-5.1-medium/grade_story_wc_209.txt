<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional character-specific interiority via artist's lens on color and confession ("paint remembers what stone forgets"); final sketches earn closure choice with visible cost of sharing fragile insight. Minor slip: Liora's introduction feels slightly ideal without relational friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly from pavilion postcards to glass revelation, yielding Charged Poise closure in sketches and shared hush; cost legible in reconfigured question-to-art path ("murals where nocturnal flowers climbed rooftops"). Orientation anchors by paragraph 2; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Etched glass and mis-seasonal pavilion constrain discovery and charge final image; sensory details (hoarfrost, ink scent) filter through artist's priorities, evolving causally with light shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (night flowers' secret) signaled early, deepens decisively via glass etchings narrowing mystery into mechanics; agency in Ira's stair climb and sketches forecloses passive ignorance with felt drive-cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden blooming emerges organically through light-vine patterns, resonating in final "umbral tenderness shared by glass and flower"; non-literal answer reweights secrecy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (color-as-confession); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("paint remembers"); rhythmic control peaks in revelation without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (petals, light, paint) without muddle, propelling via varied rhythm—"light entered at a low angle, sliding through the etched glass like water through layered rock" exemplifies propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cathedral glass as nocturnal lens transforms mystery trope into inevitable synthesis; bold lyric risk (wrong-season pavilion) heightens stakes organically, fresh in hindsight.</comment>
