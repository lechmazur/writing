<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in fidgeting as rebellion against stasis, embodied in pawn-rubbing and thread-tugging; final motive-sifting choice earned by guilt-tethered causality, confronting flaw without erasure. Pivotal: "sifted his motives as well, discarding pride" forecloses redemption-seeking with self-forgiveness cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via thread-tugs advancing stairs/bells, culminating in RR closure as final draw cleans snarl, shuddering tapestry reconfigures time with felt self-cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Selective details (suspended drops, groaning door/stairs, frayed threads) constrain choices, POV-filtered through chess patterns; recurring pawn/tapestry charge final image. Tower micro-setting guides decoding action pivotal to climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unfreeze village via labyrinth) signaled early, deepens via motive-sift under Accum lens, foreclosing pride-option with visible darkening knots/accusing villagers; agency in winnowing narrows paths, cost legible in "live beside them without flinching."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of precision-forgiveness emerges organically from chess-guilt to thread-winnowing, reweighted by final bare intention; resonant image of resuming rain answers "winnow false from true" without moralizing, tying arc inextricably.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with chess-perceptual signature (board/strategy metaphors); rhythmic diction modulates intensity, prose-as-mind reflects tutor's honed stillness; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax/rhythm propel without loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (chess/time-threads) without muddle, even in peak winnowing; read-aloud cadence breathes with scene stasis-to-release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess exile solving temporal maze via self-threaded tapestry transforms frozen-time trope; risk in motive-winnowing as pivot heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
