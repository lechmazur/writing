<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eli's "creeping normality noticer" trait drives concrete micro-choices like rituals and bed-moving, with contradictory caution (murmured apologies) yielding to immersion; final belief forecloses detachment with conceptual self-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as observational density builds to CR closure in "his own life was a creeping normality the house had noticed," reweighting premise with undeniable conceptual cost on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunlight-refusing bedroom corner constrains shard drop and bed relocation, charging dreams and final realization; selective sensory details (metallic air, rust coastline) integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of understanding house aliveness escalates texturally via rituals to storm/shard drop tightening, forcing bed move with felt exposure cost in altered sleep and dreams.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mutual noticing theme emerges organically, answered resonantly in final CR where house precedes Eli's awareness, reweighting prior observations without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature fixates on displacements ("skewed rug, leaning picture frame"), with rhythmic control modulating hushed intensity to storm's sharpness; stable single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (e.g., short storm sentences amid lyric flow); no loops, purposeful figurative pattern taught early enhances textural drive without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Anthropomorphic house noticing Eli's unnoticed changes synthesizes haunted-house trope into fresh mutual creeping normality, risking lyric accumulation that pays off inevitably at closure.</comment>
