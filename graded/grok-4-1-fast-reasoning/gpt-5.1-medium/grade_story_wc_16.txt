<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously—fear prickles skin beneath "cautious exuberance"—propelling micro-choices like dipping the pen; final vow internalization earns change with embodied cost in altered breath, no safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry to vow crafting; Charged Poise closure lands on-page with legible cost—"vow settle into my throat... snag and tear"—reconfiguring speech without evasion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring ink well constrains (dipped, trembles) and charges final image ("cradled the glass ink well"); shelves like "fossilized ribs" and dust shaft selectively mirror internal ossuary of silence, integrated via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore trust) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via lattice of vows narrowing evasion; agency in inscribing forecloses half-truths with cost—"no room for evasion, only clarity"—legible on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth-restoring language emerges organically from particulars; final "new music learning how to be a symphony of truth" offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with linguistic perceptual signature ("syntax like braided wire"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, distinct texture in syntax reflects mind under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors consistent and purposeful ("tightrope over an abyss while threading a needle") propel without overwriting in peak vow beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinct grammars enabling "symphonies of truth" transforms apology trope; Arithene lattice feels inevitable from setup, bold poetic risks heighten stakes coherently.</comment>
