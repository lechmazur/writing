<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority rooted in tidal observations shows contradictory impulses toward sea and inland life; decision to leave feels earned through embodied micro-choices like touching the pool. Lysa's presence applies relational pressure via silence and cicada-tapping. Minor diagnostic phrasing in epiphanies ("I understood then") slightly undercuts raw embodiment without fully unearning the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from argument pause to realization; single continuous scene anchors orientation early ("grotto around me breathed"). Closure lands as Decisive Change ("Let us go inland together") with legible cost of forsaking constant tides. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tidal pool and jade cicada function as micro-settings constraining reflection and charging final image ("cicada seemed to listen with us"). Sensory details (star-silver veins, waves whispering) filter through chronicler's observant bias, evolving with internal states. Grotto under stars pressures stasis-to-motion choice without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stay vs. leave) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via deepening pause to foreclose sea-bound path. Agency crystallizes in notebook closure and spoken decision with opportunity cost felt ("trade tides for terraces"). Quiet pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transitions emerges organically from particulars like cicada husk and tidal gaps, reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from "texture of time" question; resonant non-literal answer in seasonal return reconciles layers. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice stable with perceptual signature (tidal configurations as life metaphors); syntax/rhythm modulate from observational breath to decision's seepage. Minimal dialogue natural and subtextual (Lysa throat-clearing, thumb-tap). No head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("time here was not a river but a shore") propels via varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Minor overwriting in reflective strings ("pause only deepened... pauses were tides themselves") risks muddle but stays coherent and voice-motivated. Clean mechanics, vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal chronicling and inland choice transforms relationship trope via "texture of time" frame; cicada/larvae reprise inevitable in hindsight. Bold lyric risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, committing to premise's implications.</comment>
