<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line walker's motivation to preserve echoes drives consistent traits like peripheral awareness and half-mask use, with internal shift (whispering advice after near-fall) earning change; merchant's hidden cruelty reveals denial under pressure. Minor diffusion from multiple listeners, but core choices under parapet threat cohere without unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mother's relief to merchant's lurch, tightening via line walker's whisper; closure as RR (path becomes enduring wall) lands with conceptual cost in "dunes rested, the parapet slept." Orientation anchored immediately; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pavilion's silken walls and whisperfield constrain interactions vs. restless dunes; kinetic parapet recurs to charge final image, mirroring denial's motion. Sensory hierarchy (tremors in minds, grinding stones) filters through line walker's liminal bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor wisdom vs. parapet breach) signaled early, escalates accumulatively: cable steadies on truth, lurches on denial ("parapet bucked"), line walker's agency (whisper) forces reconfiguration. Cost legible in near-fall and final stabilization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shaped echoes vs. raw honesty emerges via merchant exchange, resonating in final "quiet, enduring wall against forgetting" without moralizing. Subtext in half-mask (lies vs. wishes) reweights denial's peril organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (tremors as gusts, threads between word/intent) stable in third-limited focalization on line walker; dialogue sparse but subtextual (prophet's plain answers). Rhythm modulates from sigh to exhale.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("cable steadied under his feet"); varied syntax propels from murmur to grinding. Minor repetition of "peripheral awareness" pattern-taught, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: thought-cable walking, denial-fed parapet transform prophecy trope; half-mask duality inevitable to closure's echo-wall. Risky lyric texture heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
