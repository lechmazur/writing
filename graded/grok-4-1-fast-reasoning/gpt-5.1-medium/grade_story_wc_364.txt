<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corren's meekness shown via curled shoulders contrasts determined micro-choices like tying silk and speaking low to stone, earning climax agency; motivation to coax resilience intensifies credibly without unearned epiphanies. Minor label phrasing like "quietly determined" slightly abstracts embodiment but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as hardening patterns build to silk-guided reshaping DC/RR; closure cost legible in "wire strung tight between earth and sky," with persistent silk constraint shaping tactics. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via hard yank suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Floating arches drag calcifying gravity constraining mine mapping and charge final lattice image; cobalt pears' azure glow mirrors thematic defiance selectively through POV's tactile priorities. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to mend world's breaking escalates accumulatively from tool commissions to underground peak, driven by Corren's agency in silk use; cost unmistakable in arches "groaning in answer" knotting his bones, foreclosing brittle path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of coaxing softness from hardening emerges organically via bartered hopes and stone's "newly willing" reconfiguration; final "carrying that azure defiance" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing like shards "waiting... to be" and "hopes like hot coals"; rhythmic diction modulates intensity purposefully, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image integration, e.g., "blackened fingers" advancing character/action; minor figurative density in descriptive beats (e.g., "promises") borders overwrite but no muddle or loops at closure peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calcifying planet and silk-coaxed lattice transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in lyric accumulative pattern heightens stakes, with underground gallery pile as inevitable reweighting from prior particulars.</comment>
