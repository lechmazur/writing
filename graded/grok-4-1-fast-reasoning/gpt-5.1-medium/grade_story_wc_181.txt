<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in avoidance of annotations versus bathroom retreats yielding clarity; final pursuit earned by prior overflow bewilderment, with embodied cost in overlaid reflections. Interiority particular via "catalog meteorites in his sleep yet forgot his own age." Single-POV mastery with flaws driving inevitable engagement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: annotations cluster to glow/mirror portal to CR closure, where stepping through reconfigures inheritance with conceptual cost of eroded chronology ("No regulation could stop this"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via fruit split narrows to backward ripple.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Astral orchard constrains via budding fruits/seeds as memories and mirror as portal, charging final walk among trees. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (apples suns/eyes); bathroom micro-setting guides breakthrough. Vivid integration reflects priorities without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pursue forbidden inheritance) signaled early, deepens via signature fruit revealing future self-portrait, forcing agency in mirror step. Accumulative escalation reweights options with cost ("reshape that distant bargain"). Moral calculus between regulation and duty crystallizes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance emerges organically from cameo/seeds/fruit pages, resonant CR in final realization reweights chronology lie without moralizing. Particulars (pistachio script on fruit) yield ambiguity: who inherits? Final image answers via sideways loop.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in surreal overlays ("face appeared between the first and last page of itself"). Rhythmic diction modulates to charged poise ("pulsed like soft green lanterns"); purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels: metaphors consistent (orchard/book), no loops/artifacts, rhythm varies for surreal builds. Peak beat clarity in "hand slipped through cool glass"; sentence variety heightens without overwriting drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of museum/orchard/inheritance loops feels inevitable, transforming tropes via sideways time (future fruit payment). Bold mirror portal risks heighten stakes organically; fresh cameo anchor avoids templates.</comment>
