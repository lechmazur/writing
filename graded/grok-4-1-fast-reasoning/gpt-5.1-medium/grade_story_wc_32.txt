<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied resonance ("Something in his chest answered") and contradictory impulses (fear vs. creative destruction) earning the closure choice; stoically sensitive trait constrains admission of vulnerability without label-speak. Minor backstory integrates via cues tilting present micro-choices. Final staggering reveals hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build to CR closure ("The air folded... blessings threaded... plaza cooled"); orientation anchored early ("ember nexus at twilight"); cost legible in "Corren staggered" and societal shiver. Single scene with one tightening via ritual suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains ("heat pinning his skin, boots sinking") and charges final image ("ember nexus cooled"); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (alchemical smells like "spring rain"); selective ash/embers mirror internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interrupt destiny) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ritual deepening that narrows to unchosen paths; agency in lens/words forces trade-off with felt resonance cost ("mind flooded... staggered"). One tightening coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of creative destruction emerges organically via crozier release reweighting obedience as choice; final image ("someone would quietly choose otherwise") offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Particulars like splintering shaft drive complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (alchemical metaphors like "element the world had quietly declassified"); rhythmic modulation peaks in ritual ("Light thickened... violet"); purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative density in climax ("colors folding... smelled spring rain") borders overwriting, dulling propulsion slightly; no loops, strong verbs propel to closure image. Minimal scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical ritual subverting religious artifact transforms tropes; poetic voice risks bold metaphors heightening stakes (crozier hums, blessings thread choices) without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
