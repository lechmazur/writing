<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (old fear vs. hope) act in kneeling/placing stone beat; final prayer/stance earned by chess-tied causality with exile's felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pulses modulate into pattern, tightening to covenant revelation; Charged Poise closure ("positioned differently") lands with conceptual cost in deeper dent image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stormlight hum and monoliths constrain thought alignment, charge final stone dent; selective sensory hierarchy (teeth ache to bone hum) mirrors chess urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reshape covenant) signaled early, deepens via silence translation narrowing to gentler task; agency in prayer forces reconfiguration with lifetime/moon cost legible in pulses shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Beauty-in-difficult emerges from chess exile to covenant chess game; final "rightful square" reweights promises without moral, resonant via dent image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (chess drag analogies); rhythmic control modulates from hum tension to prayer poise, no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (e.g., "chess pieces dragged by an unseen player's breath" propels without overwriting); propulsion peaks in pulses-to-prayer cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh covenant-as-chess synthesis transforms exile trope; risk in lyric silence-translation heightens stakes, inevitable in dent reprise.</comment>
