<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rafe's protective flaw drives past choice to smash box ("I understood I could protect him or stay pure... but not both") and present telling, with embodied cost in trembling hands paralleling his scars; Maya's doubt forces relational crucible without safety-hedging. Internal conflict acts simultaneously via hesitation before pulling box. Minor epiphany phrasing ("translate all this pain into a universal language") borders diagnostic but anchors in concrete cue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: reflective density builds from box cue to flashback shard, tightening via decision to share, landing Charged Poise CR closure as Maya "hold[s] weighty tools" under turning constellations with felt vulnerability cost. Orientation anchored early ("moonlit ridge path"); single transition legible. One meaningful deepening suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge, pine smoke, and porcelain box constrain sitting/telling choice and charge final image ("cracks glowed silver"); sensory hierarchy (smoke curls, stars inch) reflects Rafe's burn-scarred priorities. Body as micro-setting: "scarred hand," trembling fingers mirror internal states without overt symbolism. Professional detail (fireline saw) plausible, integrated via Maya's post-adrenaline shock.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (share burden to aid Maya) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via box pull-out and full backstory reveal narrowing vulnerability option; agency in telling forecloses secrecy with relational cost legible in Maya's shifting face. One deepening (story confession) reweights her shock; moral calculus between protection costs charges peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inherited fire/burden emerges organically from box motif shifting (childhood token to scar-mirror) and Rafe's arc, culminating in non-literal CR answer: shared pain as "universal language" via Maya's absorption. Subtext in silences (Leo behind sheriff); ambiguity lingers in constellations' witness without moralizing. Final image recharges particulars without platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV stable, perceptual signature firefighter-specific ("map of old burns," embers/stars); voice modulates rhythmically from lyrical present to terse flashback ("shards skittering"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You did good... We still lost half"), goal-driven; no head-hopping, diction fits scarred everyman.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring emotional cadence; opening "cracked eye" moon and closing constellations frame without loops. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("dust motes spun... tiny planets," "time loosen during slow dance") risks density dip in reflective beat but coheres voice-motivated; no scaffolds or artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: firefighter life as bargained innocence metaphor transforms protection trope via porcelain-box constraint and ridge-fire crucible; risk in poetic texture heightens stakes without gimmick. Final CR turn inevitable from scar/box particulars; no derivative templates.</comment>
