<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to rescue arts intensifies credibly through embodied lens vision in kitchen, earning final stay with felt personal cost; Lira's pressure via badge halo forces micro-choice alignment. Minor reflective summaries slightly abstract interior conflict, but impulses contradict in "arrogant" self-doubt vs. commitment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: layers of mist, bread, lens ghosts build to Charged Poise closure in final teaching image, reweighting private mission with undeniable endurance cost ("which of us history would spare"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity, one tightening via kitchen revelation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto waterfall and niches constrain entry/stairs, lens filters perception narrowing to ghosts that charge final image; rosewater/yeast hierarchy reflects narrator's guide bias. Sensory integration via action (crossing bridge, viewing dough) evolves with descent, mirroring internal thaw without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue arts vs. vanishing culture) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via lens-outlined lost crafts forcing stance crystallization in stay; agency in raising glass alters knowledge with visible relational cost (Lira's whisper). Minor abstractness in initial dread, but kitchen deepening forecloses departure option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preservation amid erasure emerges from bread initials and ghost crafts, resonant in final teaching without moralizing; lens reprise reweights premise (present dissolving) with conceptual cost of ongoing loss. No tidy resolution—ambiguity lingers in "spare."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature (underwater greens, brittle air) biases details consistently; Lira's "footnote" dialogue distinct/subtextual, advances via lens command. Rhythmic modulation peaks in kitchen shift, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "dough bright as riverweed" advances image/plot); rhythm varies for descent propulsion, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure. Minor elevated diction fits cultured POV without drift; opening anchors stakes cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ghost-outlined crafts and name-bread synthesize fresh cultural elegy, transforming refugee trope via lens filter; risk in accumulative immersion heightens stakes organically. Final "bind stories to letters" inevitable from particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
