<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's reticent nature and fragile hope drive micro-choices like climbing for the crystal, culminating in a courageous shift to fractured testimony; contradictory impulses toward clarity and risk act simultaneously in the realization beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as crystal fragments layer insight, tightening to Charged Poise closure where testimony reconfigures via pattern; cost legible in "thought frightened him" yielding to "barely audible armor."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cracked crystal and sonic orbs constrain insight and charge final hush-as-armor image; sensory details (dust spirals, reverberations) filter through Elias's priorities, mirroring internal growth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map growth for testimony) deepens via voice fragments under textural lens, narrowing to non-linear strategy with felt fear cost; single tightening sufficient and agency-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resistant growth emerges from fractured voices and bent-back pattern, resonating in final reconfiguration without moralizing; final image reweights linear proof's failure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (words "watching," growth as "wriggled"); rhythmic control modulates from hushed description to charged realization, no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but occasional stacked metaphors ("glitter and split like light through a damaged lens") border overwriting in realization without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sonic library and cracked-crystal playback synthesize fresh linguistic dystopia; risk-taking in textural closure heightens stakes on language's skeleton via irreplaceable world logic.</comment>
