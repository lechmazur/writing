<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in insomnia-fueled persistence; motivation compels high-stakes painting that earns partial validation, foreclosing doubt with felt vulnerability in "she knew her theory was already partly proven."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from setup to observed stranger shifts, landing CR closure with legible cost in her exposed hope; orientation anchored early in greenhouse under moon, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse glass constrains painting choice and charges final image of sinking pearl words; sensory details (plants breathe, loamy soil) filter through painterly POV, mirroring internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove kindness remembered) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via three stranger vignettes narrowing disbelief; agency in brush strokes forces trade-off of insomnia endurance, cost felt in city softening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of recoverable kindness emerges organically from lost-language fragments and stranger daydreams; final image of improbable smiles reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close stable with painterly perceptual signature ("vines teaching themselves to climb"); rhythm modulates from quiet setup to charged observations, eliding mechanics purposefully under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action-atmosphere (rainwater "shivered, thin strands... inhaled"); varied syntax propels without loops or muddled metaphors, ear-test clean even in peak painting beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis of brush as kindness-translator transforms trope via specific lost scripts and city vignettes; risk in quiet CR closure heightens stakes through irreplaceable moon-tipped agency.</comment>
