<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when "elective exile trembles" before nodding to inscribe, earning the final memory loss as visible cost tied to prior risk calculus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via stranger's arrival to inscription; RR closure lands on-page in "sliver of my own memory unmoors" with legible cost, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Garden/lagoon constrains dance-tactics ("coaxing tides...flick of my heel") and charges final image of "quiet rebellion still learning to breathe."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (inscribe despite scanner risk) signaled early, deepens via hesitation before "I nod"; agency in dance forecloses safe exile with memory cost unmistakable in closing beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of hidden memory-rebellion emerges organically via inscription trajectories; final image reconfigures premise without moral, reweighting ban's cost through stranger's tears and narrator's loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in poetic bias ("lantern-moths drift...phosphorescent hush"); stable first-person, rhythmic modulation peaks in dance syntax without head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("droplets hanging impossibly...lines of liquid script"); no loops/artifacts, figurative pattern taught early pays off in peak inscription without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tide-dance/memory-etching transforms nostalgia-ban trope; risk in dermal inscription inevitable from world-logic, heightens stakes via irreplaceable cabochon mechanics.</comment>
