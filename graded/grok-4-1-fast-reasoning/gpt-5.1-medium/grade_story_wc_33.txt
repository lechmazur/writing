<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eren's motivation rooted in sister's grave echo compels delivery choice with embodied caution; contradictory impulses in accepting bottle without questions act in scene. Mara as crucible forces micro-choice in nod ritual. Minor summary of fostering weakens some micro-turns but doesn't touch closure endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of absences and images tightens to Charged Poise closure in Mara's "eyes fixed on the trembling cork," cost legible in "storms are not polite" risks. Orientation anchored by para 2 (mailman, arcade, mail drop). Single scene coherent, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt reflections and cracked roof constrain neutral exchange, charge final image with bullet holes as leak paths. Sensory hierarchy (hummed fluorescents, brittle hush) reflects Eren's caution; evolves with thickening twilight. Micro-setting (stall jars) mirrors healer role without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver promise/heal rifts) signaled early, textural deepening in bottle tilt and lightning lick narrows to uncork risk; agency in endurance forecloses safe exit with felt cost in drone anxiety and storm dangers. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of linked absences as honest map emerges via bottle over dusty letters, resonant non-literal answer in "storms remember" reweights promises without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications invites ambiguity on healing viability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (cracks claimed by flags, clouds bruised violet) biased to Eren's continuity quest; dialogue subtextual ("promises can be bottled"), goal-driven with idiom distinction (Mara's thin smoke voice). Stable third-close, no leakage; rhythm modulates to peak indirection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., bag's math homework wraps bottle advances stakes/motif); rhythmic variety in short punchy dialogue beats. Minor overwrite in repeated bruise motifs coherent but risks muddle in high-pressure exchange (-0.3); no loops, clear propulsion to cork image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of border mailman smuggling storm-bottle promise transforms smuggling trope via absences map; risk in "respectfully rebellious" heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight in healer's cork poise from early arcade neutrality.</comment>
