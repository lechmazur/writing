<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's ego death numbness thaws through embodied sparks ("faintest spark of panic") and final tremble, earning renunciation of victory; contradictory impulses to win vs. feel act in defensive parries, revealing values with custody cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds as memory duel tightens from verbal claims to blade strikes, yielding Charged Poise RR in "Wait... voice trembled" renunciation; cost legible in foreclosed erasure and risked loss, with dojo drift as constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating rocks, glass tendrils, and flickering sky constrain duel choreography and charge final "dojo rocks drifted closer"; sensory selection (robe snapping, floor rippling) mirrors thawing numbness without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant numbness stake signaled early, escalates via defensive choices narrowing to guilt preservation; agency in "I parried... defend a memory" forces trade-off, with visible emotional cost in raw stirring.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Guilt-as-humanity theme emerges from memory clashes and opposites motif, reweighted in renunciation without moral; final image resonates selfhood question through preserved monstrous potential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature ("feelings... faint shadows") biases to numbness thaw, modulating rhythm under duel stress; dialogue subtextual ("duplication is origin... not fraud") advances claims distinctly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("Kesh nodded, verdict forming"); minor figurative pile-up in "sky flickered through centuries" slightly dulls peak without obscuring closure tremble.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Memory blades testing clone selfhood via opposites transforms custody trope; history-rewrite surrealism risks bold synthesis, inevitable in guilt-preserving halt.</comment>
