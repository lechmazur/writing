<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's embodied contradictions shine in weaving memories (chest tightens amid cool air), compelling the final wrapping choice with visible cost (red bracelets, metal taste). Architect's professional reluctance forces micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. Final renunciation earned via prior causality; distinct voices in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via weaving shifts to Charged Poise closure ("wrapped the thread around the doorway... fastened there"). Orientation anchored early (city corridor, flickering sign). Persistent thread constraint shapes tactics; cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gallery walls and thread constrain weaving choices, charging final doorway silhouette. Sensory hierarchy (neon embers, pulsing thread, humming knots) reflects urgency; recurring "unsettling calm" mirrors internal anesthesia. Evolving geometry grounds surrealism without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (remember without hurting) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through weaving revelations narrowing to doorway choice. Agency in wrapping forecloses paths with on-page cost (tension bracelets, soul-anesthesia). Pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory's "cruelest talent" tamed emerges organically via shifts ("smoothing sharp corners into curves"); final image reweights as non-literal answer (fastened between possibilities). Subtext in silences/gestures avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (surreal bias: "corridors unfurling like careful hallucinations") modulates rhythm under stress. Dialogue subtextual ("structure is only emotion taught to stand up straight"), advances via implication. No head-hopping; diction/rhythm heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors coherent/teachable ("sinew thread... salvaged from inside of lightning"). Varied rhythm, no loops; figurative density purposeful in peak weaving beat. Minor overwriting in shifts doesn't dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal architecture transforms memory trope via thread-weaving logic; risks bold (space erupts from pinhole) heighten stakes inevitably. Final reconfiguration feels earned hindsight; no derivative echoes.</comment>
