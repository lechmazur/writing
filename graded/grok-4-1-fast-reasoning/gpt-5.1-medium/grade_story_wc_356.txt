<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (hunger/fear braided) act in scene via persuasive speech to Maru; final planting choice earned by scent-embodied motivation and prior labor confession, with visible risk cost. Liora's olfactorily attuned interiority particular and embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of scents/textures builds to Charged Poise closure in final sentence ("whole village inhaled to listen"), reconfiguring fear/wisdom with conceptual cost of potential catastrophe. Orientation anchored early in climb; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Treetop setting (rope bridges, swaying platforms) constrains ascent/planting choice and charges final image; olfactory hierarchy (resin, cedar smoke) reflects herbalist POV bias, vivid/selective across senses. Moss/loam cradle integrates tactilely into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (plant death to gain wisdom vs village rot fear) signaled early, tightens via Maru's challenge ("ask death to bloom where children sleep") forcing persuasive agency; cost legible in fragile serenity amid motion, foreclosing safe descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Undercurrent of wisdom emerges organically from scent perceptions, seed planting, and grandmother's teaching; final image resonant reconfiguration answers serenity-in-motion question non-literally, reweighting decay as potential bloom without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (scent as "unspoken script," "resin ghosts") stable in single close-third POV; dialogue subtextual (Maru's caution vs Liora's interruption), goal-driven, distinct idiom. Rhythm modulates with ascent pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines like "wind made houses creak like old throats") propels without loops; rhythmic variety in sentence lengths supports swaying motion. Figurative language (pollen silence) pattern-taught via scents, coherent in peak council beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of olfactory herbalism, corpse flower taboo, treetop peril transforms tropes; risky ascent/planting feels inevitable from scent-driven traits, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
