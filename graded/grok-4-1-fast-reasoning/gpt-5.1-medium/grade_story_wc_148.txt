<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and motivation rooted in father's lessons compel micro-choices like shifting the cot and ear-pressing; embodied flaws (fraud inheritance) drive blind spots without tidy resolution. Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9; endurance feels earned but lacks hairline contradiction in peak discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from groans to library revelation, landing CR closure in "cloak wrapped about my shoulders" with conceptual cost (belief sustaining vanishings). Orientation anchored by ~50 words (dusk arrival, reef prison); persistent constraint of tower sounds shapes tactics to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (oars clicking teeth, rust/smoke air) filters through POV's story-listening bias; lattice and scuffs constrain peeking, charging discovery of spiraling lights. Reef/lighthouse pressures escape (no run except waves' knives), mirroring internal "throat clogged with tales" for 9+ constraint on final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grow story to open stone before bodies found) signaled early, tightens texturally via sound-mapping to library glimpse narrowing options. Agency in quiet endurance (listening sideways) forecloses running; cost legible in time pressure, but lacks one deeper reversal beyond accumulative density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stories birthing truth in distrust emerges organically from particulars (father's shouts, unfinished pages); final CR reweights premise (prison as story-throat) without moralizing. Resonant ambiguity lingers in "muddy mine into something of my own," charging prior fraud inheritance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sounds as laughter, stones muttering) biases toward story-labyrinths; rhythmic modulation accelerates in discovery ("shapes swim in the darkness"). First-person stable, voice-motivated metaphors consistent without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (stacked mouths, will-o-wisps) taught early, varying rhythm propels to closure; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwrite in metaphor density during mapping slightly dulls peak propulsion, but clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cry-wolf fraud into metaphysical library-prison transforms tropes via "throat clogged with tales"; bold lighthouse-as-labyrinth risks heighten stakes. Inevitable hindsight in scuffed door to hovering paths feels non-obvious and organic.</comment>
