<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mariel's "sanely eccentric" traits drive concrete micro-choices like star-marking pauses and following the poet, earning her realization that stories live in attention; contradictory impulses between elaborate diagrams and simple observation act on-page without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from diagrammed paths and star-marked hesitations to CR closure at poet's pause, where "hyperbolic map collapsed into something simpler"; conceptual cost of unnecessary elaboration legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Library's "geodesic" shelves and "cool and grainy" intersections constrain her paths and charge the poet's hesitation as story-source, with POV-filtered details like "words rising like steam" mirroring internal quest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to locate story origins tightens via poet's pause narrowing infinite branches to single depth; agency in following forecloses elaborate methods with felt conceptual cost, though stake leans abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of stories as "posture of attention" emerges organically from particulars like star-paths and poet's breath, with final image reweighting hyperbolic premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—bending geodesics, humming books—holds stable close-third POV, with rhythmic modulation building to charged "fabric pinched at one point" without elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates metaphors like "dusk bled into violet" purposefully for texture; no loops or scaffolds, though figurative prevalence in peaks nears overwrite but serves accumulative drive without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry as memory-map synthesizes science-poetry ingeniously, with poet's hesitation turning familiar library trope into fresh conceptual payoff that feels inevitable.</comment>
