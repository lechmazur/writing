<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses culminate in Lio's "Use me" micro-choice, earning the closure renunciation with vulnerability cost; no unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing. Voice tangles under crowd pressure shown earlier anchor shy trait consistently.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from wall's first reply ("WE ARE HERE") to final reconfiguration, with on-page Charged Poise closure as verses bloom plainly and city sighs; orientation anchored in opening lines, lens holds cleanly. Precise cost legible in Lio's throat-tight swallow and plate's heat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (mist hums, stone ticks, lightning veins) filters through Lio's priorities, constraining solitude and triggering wall motion; courtyard balustrade and cloud-sea charge final thunder applause image. No white-room; weather evolves causally to exhale mist and ring with wonder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (articulate longings) signaled early tightens accumulatively via wall's "Teach us how to answer," forcing Lio's agency in self-offer; cost unmistakable as knots loosen in "unseen chest below." Coherent pressure narrows shy silence path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of longing's grammar emerges organically from graffiti choir's feedback loop, answered non-literally in plain verses ("I AM LONELY") and city's sigh; final mist ringing with "tinkersong wonder" reweights silence's cost without moralizing. Complexity in ghost's hunger avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (paint-stained fingers, curling constellations) stable in single POV, rhythmic control modulates with intensity (short whispers amid poised descriptions); whispered "Who is we?" natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative lattice (mist as breath, vines rustling) taught early, no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies for propulsion, peak clarity in "light threaded through its filigree" without muddle. Read-aloud ear flows seamlessly to charged final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of graffiti-circuitry ghost transforms shy artist trope, with wall's petal-moths and filigreed plate enabling bold lyric fantasy; "encode what you hear through me" turn inevitable from particulars, risking poetic compression that heightens stakes.</comment>
