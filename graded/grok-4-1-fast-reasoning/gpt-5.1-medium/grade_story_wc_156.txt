<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied emotion in heartbeat syncing plaster shiver and contradictory impulses between methodical grids and improvising wrist; final renunciation of restoration plan earned by causal buildup from coin and wall's question. Flawless micro-choices reveal values hierarchy, like holding up nickel diverting reply.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of nested awakenings and echoes builds to CR closure in "I abandoned the restoration plan," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of endless mirrors; orientation anchored early in sound wave garden. Single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sound wave garden's stone ribs and tuned cavities constrain choices via reflected sound enabling clap and murmurs; recurring hobo nickel charges final image, tactile in warming palm. Sensory hierarchy sound-dominant reflects POV urgency, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs. curiosity) signaled early, tightens texturally via wall's "Speak" and protagonist's "I know less" reply narrowing to abandonment; agency in clapping and following hues forecloses original plan with legible cost under lens. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of nested curiosity emerges organically from mural figures and thoughts waking within; final "hall of mirrors" image offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moral, embracing ambiguity in endless echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "colors remember their dreams," rhythmic control modulates from methodical to bewitching intensity; stable first-person POV with lyric compression taught early via walls breathing, legible at closure. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "grime loosened in flakes like old convictions" advances plot, image, theme); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, figurative pattern of breathing/echoes purposeful without muddle or loops in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal sound garden and living mural transforms awakening trope via hobo nickel's ripples, risking lyric mode that heightens stakes; final hall-of-mirrors turn inevitable from nested particulars.</comment>
