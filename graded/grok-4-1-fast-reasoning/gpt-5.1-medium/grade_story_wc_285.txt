<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Coachman's interiority shines in embodied rituals like tracing the yarn needle and holding layered secrets, with contradictory impulses (keeping vs. releasing vows) earning the final distillation. Mother's plea and boy's cough apply crisp secondary pressure. Minor lightness in mother/boy limits relational crucible depth, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: layers build density until "meanings thinned into a shared, spindrift serenity," delivering Charged Poise closure with legible cost (overwritten vows). Single scene anchors early (coachman waiting at crossing); no orientation debt. Waiver applies: fog disorientation pays off in final blank-page bank.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog-bound setting constrains choices (skiff emerges as "erasure," hooves "by feel alone") and charges closure image ("hill and village blurred... blank page"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (fog feels shapes). Micro-object (yarn needle) anchors amid evolving mist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distilling burdens) signaled early, deepens via whisper layering pressure under Accumulative lens; coachman's agency (pause, touch needle, hold/thin words) forecloses "keeping" path with felt cost at "spindrift serenity." One tightening sufficient; cost unmistakable in semantic thinning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Palimpsest theme emerges organically from layered secrets distilling to serenity, with final image ("blank page the night itself was quietly learning to read") offering resonant non-literal reconfiguration. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in unseen walker.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in fog-like perceptual signature ("fog feels the shape") and rhythmic modulation (short breaths before click); whisper natural/subtextual. Stable single POV; compression taught early, legible at Charged Poise end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "chalk-pale face... waiting for it to finish explaining" advances plot/character/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, metaphors coherent/patterned (palimpsest, spindrift). Zero loops/artifacts; propulsion peaks flawlessly at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychopomp trope via palimpsest coachman and needle-anchored listening transforms familiar crossing into inevitable "spindrift" release. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes organically, no hedging.</comment>
