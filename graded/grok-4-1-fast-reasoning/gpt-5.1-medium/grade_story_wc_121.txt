<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in specific visions (e.g., falling under train vs. monastery) act in scene, compelling retrace; final renunciation of floating earned by prior causality with visible cost of gravity's return.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of visions/rooms builds pattern, breaks via retrace simplifying maze; CR closure lands on-page as Lio emerges with gravity claiming him, cost legible in "the less he floated; gravity returned."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Viaduct's wet stones, frozen drops as "tiny lens of the city," and railing constrain choices (stepping off sideways); charges final image of tablet sliding into dark water below.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to conquer self signaled early, tightens via visions narrowing to one corridor under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in losing floating ability as maze simplifies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bearing witness over erasure emerges implicitly from retraced rooms sealing cracks; final image of tablet in water offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting fractured selves.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing of light/water/timelines; rhythmic control modulates with pressure (short sentences in visions), POV stable with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "water beaded... refused to remember the rain"); no loops/artifacts, purposeful rhythm varies without muddle in peak maze beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of procedural timelines on clay tablet transforms multiverse trope via grounded retrace; risk-taking in surreal maze heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at viaduct return.</comment>
