<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora's interiority shines in pricking her finger to test the flame and stitching rumors into cloth, revealing contradictory impulses of caution and commitment; prince applies targeted pressure as foil. Final renunciation earned via prior lie-detection and conspiracy knowledge. Voice distinction clear in dialogue idioms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whispers/patterns/texture densify to Charged Poise closure in empty-loop chart and ghost warning, with conceptual erasure cost legible ("places without stories become easy to erase"). Orientation anchored by para 1; single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eternal candle constrains choices (flame bends on prince's lie, shivers on stitches) and charges final shadows arguing futures; frost fingerprints and spiral stairs ground tactile space. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (needles in flame light). Micro-setting (desk/cloth) alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unpredictable charts amid coup shadow) signaled early, tightens accumulatively in stitching reversal (merchants/deserters mapped, palace emptied). Prince's agency tests Liora's; cost felt in foreclosed safe path ("vanish completely"). One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unheard stories emerges via stitching conspiracies, reweighted non-literally in closure image (empty loop as unpredictable path with erasure cost). Subtext in silences and flame implications; no moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from listening/ghost tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (rumors swirling "like unmoored constellations"); voice texture modulates rhythmically from descriptive inhale to deepened silence. Dialogue subtextual (prince's "sew futures" vs. her "mend what others tear"); no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "flame trembled as if hearing a rumor" advances lie-test and atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (threads/rivers/shadows) without muddle in peak stitching beat. Propulsion peaks in "observatory seemed to inhale."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: embroiderer as conspiracy cartographer transforms prophecy trope via lie-detecting flame and empty-loop chart. Risky cryptic closure heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, inevitable in hindsight from adjacent-possibilities frame.</comment>
