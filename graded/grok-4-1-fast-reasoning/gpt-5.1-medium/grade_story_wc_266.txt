<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Descent memories show concrete, particular unused moments (swallowed words, unsung song) as contradictory impulses clashing with fear, earning the star's integration as courage; guides apply tender pressure without stock excess.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with memory density tightening to Charged Poise closure at "the star within her answered," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of foreclosed safe life legible in final breath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Slick walkway and spiraling stairs constrain descent choices; sand and hum charge final image, mirroring internal hum with sensory evolution from mist to tar-salt beams.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of leash-break courage signaled early escalates accumulatively via rib-ache necessity and step-memories narrowing options; agency in descending forecloses shop path with felt cost in star-sink.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Leash/courage motif emerges organically through particulars, final star-breath offering non-literal reconfiguration of "unused courage waits" that reweights run's fear without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (fear panting beside her, ache unnamed as courage); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, voice modulating rhythm to pressure in descent hum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image integration, but opening simile cluster ("breath not yet decided," "purple...bruise") borders overwrite without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ferry-as-internal-traverse transforms escape trope into fresh synthesis of courage quest, with star-punch and memory steps feeling inevitable from ridgeway setup.</comment>
