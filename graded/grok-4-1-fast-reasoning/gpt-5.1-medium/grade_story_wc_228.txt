<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (alooness vs. promise-keeping) act in scene via decision to enter cave despite warnings; final painting renunciation of waiting earned by journey's causality with cost of isolation. Interiority particular (turpentine hands, shell nostalgia); no unearned epiphanies. Flaw of aloofness complicates belonging without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflective density builds to cave pool CR (reconfigures promise from unkept to witnessed) with felt cost in "leaving... most of my fear behind" and night's closure. Orientation anchored by ~100 words (quay painter, cracked mirror). One tightening (wrong turn) narrows to painting; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cave constrains choice (lantern gutters, pool for brushes) and charges final image (colors held without mixing). Sensory selective (lime air, mineral veins as sails); POV-biased (painterly spirals). No white-room; spatial coherent from quay to shaft-lit pool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (paint unreal place, keep promise) signaled early; accumulative deepening via cave entry narrows options (tides devour wanderers) with agency (slips through cleft). Cost legible in darkness pressure and foreclosed waiting. Minor slip: internal conflict dominates over external reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of temporary eternity emerges from shell/pool/mirror particulars, reweighted in final "proof" without moralizing. Resonant CR: painting as unbroken mirror answers promise's ambiguity. No tidy binary; aloofness accepts cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature (painterly veining, strokes as reveal) stable; rhythmic modulation (short sentences in cave tension). No head-hopping; elision (unpainted canvas) taught early, paid in pool. Diction controlled, lyric without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting: repeated "temporary eternity" borders paraphrase in reflections (−0.3). Closure image clear ("night close... curtain"); no artifacts touch peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: quay painter's mirror-crack quest yields cave as inner "temporary eternity," riskily lyric without gimmick. Transformation of artist trope via shell/pool constraint feels inevitable. No derivatives; bold cave payoff heightens stakes.</comment>
