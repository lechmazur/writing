<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's contradictory phobia (kinked body) vs. emerging anger compels micro-choice to trace boy's cast and add "TRUST HURTS, TRUST HEALS," earning closure renunciation of invisibility with embodied cost (shaking hands, steady voice). Boy's presence forces relational pressure, revealing her through direct exchange. Internal arc specific, no unearned epiphanies; flaws (phobias) drive transformation without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cast list discovery anchors betrayal stake early (~100 words), boy's entry/ cast decryption patterns fears into answers, tightening to Charged Poise closure ("I understood how to turn their betrayal... writer of my own danger") with conceptual cost (erasure vs. framed agency). Single scene coherent, orientation immediate (library post-file burn). No causality breaks; micro-turns (seashell signal) pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted stacks "like metal ribs gone orange," whispering seashell, painted stars constrain reflection and charge final image (under soundstage stars, breath aligns with boy's). Sensory selective (wind hiss narrowing phobia perception); POV bias (stunt marks familiar) mirrors internal kinks. Details tactile/lived ("trailing a nurse," cast "mottled with rain"), evolving with interaction; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (erasure to visibility via vulnerability) signaled by cast list, deepens accumulatively through cast codes (FALL→LEARN), forcing agency in addition and resolve ("hold out my burned resume"). Trade-off legible: trembling vs. certainty forecloses passivity. Pressure coheres to closure without coincidence resolution; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (vulnerability as power) emerges organically from fears→codes pattern, boy's crossed-out fears reweighting her betrayal without statement. Final image (resume as protest, "trembling certainty") offers non-literal answer, charging ambiguity (manufactured star vs. real falls). No moralizing; irony in stunt double's "falls felt because terrified."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person voice distinct (poetic internals: "everything feels borrowed, even your breath") vs. boy's plain ("What happened to your name"); rhythm modulates (short declarative close). Stable POV, perceptual bias (phobias kink perception); dialogue goal-driven/subtextual (boy evinces shared fear, prompts her addition). No head-hopping; compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines, e.g., "stacks were metal ribs... organs in jars" advances setting/atmosphere); rhythm varies (long reflective to incantation read-aloud). No loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent/patterned (wire/magnet, fight choreographer's map). Propulsion peaks at decryption ("pattern rearranged something inside me"); clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Hollywood identity-erasure via stunt double + child's fear-cipher cast transforms betrayal trope into "weaponizing quiver." Risky poetic voice heightens stakes (phobia specificity avoids generic); non-obvious turn (trust inscription redefines script) inevitable from particulars. No template echoes; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
