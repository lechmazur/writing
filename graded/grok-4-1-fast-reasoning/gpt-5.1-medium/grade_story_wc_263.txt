<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (terror and longing braiding) act simultaneously in the climax lift, earning the final surrender with embodied cost in steady hands; interiority particular via inherited hearing and unsung backlog.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as murmurs sharpen to personal sentence then tunnel release; Charged Poise closure legible in "pressure eased, replaced by ringing emptiness" with conceptual cost of surrendered possibilities.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Astrolabe as micro-setting constrains tracing choice and charges transparent flare image; sensory hierarchy (tastes of metal, sky breathing) reflects dreamer's bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (free ideas for rest) tightens via density shift from random murmurs to skull-pressing sentence; agency in lifting amid braided terror forecloses shelved-life path with felt emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unsung ideas as trapped creativity emerges via dust grains (child's wings, singing equations) reweighting rest as surrender; final pouring storm answers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "ears that heard unspoken words" biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from shaky hands to steady lift under pressure, stable first-person.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "aurora sagged low...fingers searching for a pulse"); minor metaphor density in climax flare but coherent, no loops dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrolabe charting "unwritten calendar" transforms aurora trope into idea-hoard release; risk in shadowed rapture tone heightens stakes organically.</comment>
