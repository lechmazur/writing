<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's "shielded openness" and methodical curiosity create contradictory impulses that earn the final recommendation; embodied in his millimeter obsession and footage scrutiny. Mara applies light pressure but remains secondary without deepening the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from map tear to footage silences culminating in CR closure—"reopen... only as a place to listen"—with felt cost in damaged trust. Orientation anchored early; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Museum basement and footage (rain-scoured saints, slick stairs) constrain interpretation and charge final listening image; sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's edge-reading bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of interpreting anomaly deepens via footage comparison, narrowing to empathetic stance; cost legible in apology-like return and foreclosed certainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of stone as listener emerges from footage silences without statement; final image reweights absences as trust broken, resonant and oblique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in edge/absence noticing; rhythmic modulation heightens under scrutiny, elisions purposeful for silence motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; minor figurative density in reflections purposeful, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of maps, silent footage, whispered chapel transforms legend into empathetic listening; risk in quiet CR pays off inevitably.</comment>
