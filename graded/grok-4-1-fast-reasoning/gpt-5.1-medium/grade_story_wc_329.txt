<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's interiority is concrete and particular, with dreams of fruit trees bearing song revealing motivation rooted in reawakening beauty; shift from city-calming music to pulse-matching play shows earned change with embodied cost in aching arms. Contradictory impulses emerge in fragile rebellions versus coaxing dissonance. Quick test met: impulses act in scene, final choice earned by causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant at closure) holds: shell triggers pulse accumulation leading to RR closure as Lio steps onto rising bough, reconfiguring world with cost (city darkened, panic/laughter). Single scene, orientation anchored early (sky-bridge, orchards by para 2). Cost legible in "arms ached" and heaving ground.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (gears shedding iron snow, rune-lit statue eyes) filter through Lio's POV; orchard statues constrain patrol-to-transformation, violin as micro-setting charges music beats. Final branches tangling sky-bridge fulfill 9+ gate. Spatial choreography coherent from height to descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken beauty vs. mechanical indifference) signaled early, escalates via pulse-deepening under Accumulative lens: one tightening as music matches rhythm, narrowing to uproot command with agency in bow strokes. Cost unmistakable in roots snapping, power lines tearing, Lio's ache. Quick test: agency-driven, cost on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty freeing nature from machine emerges organically through images (bark blooming on statues, liberated serpents); final rising bough offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting mechanical world without moralizing. Quick test met: reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (music as roots searching water); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, no head-hopping. Perceptual bias toward vegetal rhythms biases noticing. Quick test: signature and control under pressure intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punches in climax: "roots snapped... gentle pops"); purposeful metaphors coherent (locust as "hollow outline... that had already broken free"). No loops/artifacts dull closure; propulsion peaks in "branches... tugging him." Quick test met: zero flaws in propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk (machinists, brass drones) with vegetal uprising via music; locust shell-to-bough arc transforms tropes organically. Risk in lyric escalation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Quick test: inevitable synthesis, risk elevates (+0.3).</comment>
