<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eli's motivation to merge timelines intensifies through concrete actions like humming the melody despite tingling teeth, earning the final choice; interiority particular via pattern recognition. Passengers as archetypal foils apply secondary pressure without overwhelming his drive. Contradictory positivity under stress acts in scene, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hybrid Accumulative/Causal lens holds: textural density of patterns builds to causal tuning/humming that steers into grotto; orientation anchored early via deckhand on ferry. Closure as CR ("He chose home") reconfigures timelines with cost legible in "aimed the note at that absence" and overlapping ferries image. One tightening via radio note suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto constrains choice as ferry "slides forward," charging final image with overlaid subway/constellations; fog from "unsaid possibilities" mirrors stakes. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (Eli hears patterns). Environment shapes tactics (rails gripped, radio tuned); 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (merge vs bounce) signaled early, tightens via passenger circle and grotto entry under Accumulative lens, narrowing to "choose home" with agency in tuning/humming. Cost felt in lurch and vanished passengers' ferries; one decisive deepening suffices, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of plaited transience emerges organically from braided melody, hourglass void, overlapping ferries; final image reweights "scattered passengers" into permanent without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like "ungrains sliding invisibly"; 9+ test met via non-literal answer to merging.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature via "static plucked a thin melodic line" and pattern bias; rhythm modulates with stress (short sentences in grotto). No head-hopping; purposeful compression taught early pays at closure. 9+ test: distinct signature under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with metaphors coherent (e.g., "stars slipped sideways like commuters"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddle in peak (grotto entry propels). Rhythm varies for propulsion; zero artifacts touch closure. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry vanishing, radio patterns, timeline grotto feels inevitable; risk in lyric textural drive heightens stakes without gimmick. Transformation of commuter trope via "lattice of days"; 9+ test via non-obvious inevitability.</comment>
