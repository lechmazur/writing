<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's reluctance and obligation root clear motivation, with contradictory impulses shown in guiding despite instinct to send away; final realization earns change via accumulated failures. Interiority concrete and embodied, as in "nut burned like a coal." Blind spots compound realistically without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of guiding examples tightens to blueprint-seeker, yielding CR closure where "blueprint wanted to be remembered" reweights premise with conceptual cost of potential freedom. Orientation anchored early in orchard/cliff. No lens ambiguity; persistent nut constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (sea grind, rust freckled brass) filter through POV urgency, constraining choices via frost/paths/birds; recurring nut and ghost paths charge final image. Micro-setting (nut, terraces) alters tactics indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide vs. curse/blueprint) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via traveler examples and birds' patterns forcing encounters; final traveler tightens with nut's burn, foreclosing defiance path with felt obligation cost. Agency in nut-assembly choices visible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of defying/embracing blueprint emerges organically from particulars like ghost paths and frost; final image offers resonant CR repricing without moral, reweighting obligation via orchard's stir. No tidy resolution, ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature ("ghost paths forked and rejoined") and rhythmic control modulate with intensity; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("fastest way through"). Stable POV, no leakage; diction reflects weary precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "frost filmed the orchard, tracing every footprint she had not taken"); varied rhythm propels without loops or artifacts. Figuratives cohere (hungry tide, graceless beauty), clear under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blueprint-as-possibility, nut-assembly, bird-messengers transforms curse trope; risk in poetic accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via pattern of paths/frost. Non-obvious angle on memory/choice.</comment>
