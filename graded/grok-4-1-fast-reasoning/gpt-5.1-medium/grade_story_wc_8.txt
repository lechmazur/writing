<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's "emotionally rational" trait constrains his measured demands during climax debate, earning final stand; Mara applies sharp secondary pressure via status dynamics; minor backstory block anchors to present folder cue without flattening stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Situational lens holds as debate pressure crystallizes stances; orientation anchors by line 2 (station, Elias arrival); Charged Poise closure in Elias's stand and "night vision" line reconfigures truth-relationship with conceptual cost of undermined faith legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy recurs to constrain mood and charge final shiver/echo image, mirroring debate's creeping annotations; rosebush petal anchors timeframe and tightens Elias's late arrival; selective sensory bias (e.g., footsteps click) reflects Elias's suspicion without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture rights) signaled early via folder/T, tightens via dialogue reversal on "noble lies"; protagonist agency in threat to publish forces Mara's hesitation, with felt cost in "undermine faith" vs. "night vision" options crystallized at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Noble lies theme emerges from debate particulars (king's massacres in footnotes) without statement; final ivy/echo image reweights fiction-as-truth premise via Conceptual Repricing, lingering ambiguity on guidance vs. exposure; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elias's ivy-as-handwriting filters; dialogue subtext-laden (Mara traces T amid evasion), advances goals; rhythmic control peaks in short, punchy final lines under debate stress, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with metaphors (ivy "thick handwriting") integrated into action; no loops, varied syntax propels debate rhythm; zero artifacts in closure beat, read-aloud ear clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fiction bleeding into real authority via king's "luminous" massacres; risk in quiet debate closure heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick; irreplaceable ivy/T particulars transform truth-tropes.</comment>
