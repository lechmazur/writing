<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of Mara's discerning curation and "sandstorm calm" in her palm's tingle from the locket and decision to host circles; contradictory endurance of intrusion via communal listening earns closure choice with communal cost. Internal conflict layers quietly through her "stubborn and small" resistance. Minor dilution from group voices but Mara's tracing unifies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: story-sharing density tightens to pattern break at "cement crumbled with a soft surrender," delivering on-page RR/CR with legible communal cost in held breaths. Orientation anchors instantly in thrift-store/courtyard. Single tightening via reconstructed history suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Courtyard and mailboxes constrain choices (dawn circles, keyhole press) and charge closure image; sensory hierarchy (hissing coffee, flapping laundry, sirens) reflects Mara's listening bias. Recurrent brass details evolve tactilely. Micro-setting (locked box) indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (courtyard preservation vs. intrusion) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via neighbor stories narrowing to deed revelation; Mara's listening agency forecloses developer path with on-page collective cost in patient press. One deepening reweights options undeniably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of listening healing concrete emerges organically from shared stories and final "every waiting breath"; resonant non-literal answer in document reprices intrusion premise without moralizing. Complexity lingers in communal irony of sealed history.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature in biased noticing (vibrant courtyard "listened to every siren"); rhythmic modulation peaks in closure's hushed hold. Sparse, natural neighbor dialogue advances via subtext ("What do you hear?"). No head-hopping; elision purposeful.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm; purposeful lyric metaphors ("bougainvillea spilled like open veins") taught early without muddle or loops. Minor figurative density in opening risks slight opacity but serves accumulative texture without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious locket-mailbox synthesis transforms community trope via tactile mystery; fresh "listening harder than machines" angle risks bold lyricism that heightens stakes. Irreplaceable particulars make closure inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
