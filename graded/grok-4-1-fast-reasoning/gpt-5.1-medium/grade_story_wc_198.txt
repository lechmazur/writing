<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in ritual hesitation versus refusal; final stasis earned by compounded mornings, with nostalgia as visible cost in "eerie nostalgia for a disaster that might now refuse to happen."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens taught early via dawn pattern; reflective shards anchor to present cue (sax lift); closure as Charged Poise reconfigures prophecy hold with conceptual cost in unraveling exhale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto's prism shards and mist constrain play, mirror internal amendment; droplets evolve causally from forming to mineral tears, charging final damp exhale image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to silence prophecy tightens accumulatively through failed dawns to climactic note refusal; agency in gaps forecloses completion, cost legible in loosened future and nostalgia.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of coded utterance's burden emerges via particulars; final image non-literally answers by unhooking prophecy, reweighting code's power without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with musical perceptual bias ("notes to scratch... slow handwriting"); diction rhythm heightens from hesitation to release without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density weaves image/action; metaphors cohere via brass/negative space pattern, propelling to climax without loops; minor density in reflections purposeful for textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prophecy-via-sax code fresh, transformed by negative-space reversal; risk in lyric accumulation inevitable at eerie nostalgia close.</comment>
