<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maris's contradictory impulses—father's "fire loved distraction" vs. chief's "kid first"—act simultaneously in the run to the boy, earning the closure choice of grafting her coin to his jar with visible emotional cost in her final ease.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through because/therefore progression from dune crest sighting to boy rescue to shared return ritual; Charged Poise closure lands on-page in "something quiet inside finally ease[s]" with legible cost of carrying dual voices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and hot sand constrain the pivotal run—distance calculus forces back-to-fire vulnerability—while salt-smoke and kelp hieroglyphs charge the final watch image, filtering through Maris's scarred priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kid vs. fire amid legacy) tightens causally when she turns back on flames; agency in body-shield and jar handover forecloses distraction path with neck-kissing heat as felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scars-sing theme emerges implicitly from father's pier-blaze mirror to boy's jar ritual, reweighted non-literally in coin-graft image that answers legacy curse without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward fire calculus and paternal echoes; boy's dialogue carries natural subtext ("give it back") pursuing curse-break goal amid tremblng clink.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm matching urgency (short "Maris moved" to flowing dune prose); minor figurative density in opening fire line ("dancer, gracefully alert") risks overload but pattern-taught without closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Arson-daughter grafting coin to curse-jar synthesizes fire legacy and compassion into inevitable fresh turn; risk in poetic coastal physics (fire following cloud migration) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
