<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—doubts from tepid spells vs. devotion biting down—act in the dripping ritual; final alignment earns her cosmic success with felt cost of risked faith, as in "her faith... once cracked it might never hold again."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from bell's silence to drop alignment, delivering CR closure in "She let it ring," reweighting inadequacy with undeniable conceptual cost of tilted oceans.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Viaduct's plinth and sea drop constrain the dripping method, charging the final peach sky and ringing; sensory details like "arches glowed with a sleepy blue" filter through her priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of cosmic righting deepens via drops aligning to reveal "storms had leaned wrong," forcing realization that forecloses inadequacy path; cost legible in tilted ocean weight under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked gifts redeeming devotion emerges from dripping particulars; "mentors had said... Yet here the world was" offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (drops as "numbers, every number a plea") modulates to incantatory peak in "I cannot make you whole," sustaining pressure; stable close-third POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; no loops or artifacts, purposeful metaphors like "silent gasp" cohere without muddling the ringing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dripping rates as cosmic fix transforms mage inadequacy trope organically; fresh synthesis feels inevitable, with lyric risk heightening stakes via bell's evolving silence.</comment>
