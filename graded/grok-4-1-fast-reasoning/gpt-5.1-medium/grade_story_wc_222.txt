<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the offering of personal fear inside the king, compelling the shift to unguarded openness; embodied emotions like chest ache ground the arc without therapy-speak. Final choice to lift the lid unarmed earns closure via prior micro-choices under pressure. Minor phrasing like "cautious abandon" borders label-ish but ties to action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with imagery density building from climb to summit CR: lid's click and questions reconfigure premise, cost felt in vulnerability of possible lives. Orientation anchors immediately in spire and theft goal. Persistent spire/sky constraint shapes tactics to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy via thief's priorities—slick rungs, frost prayers—constrains climb choices; wrong sky pulses evolve to bruise colors, charging closure image. Micro-setting (pedestal, lid) mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism. POV bias filters vividly, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wonder over wisdom) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via bargain response and engravings that narrow cynical guard to open embrace. Protagonist agency in whispered bargain and final lift forecloses shielded path with legible emotional cost. Lens-driven cadence shift reweights under sky pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unarmed meeting future emerges organically from lid questions inviting alternate lives, reweighting theft as amendment without moral state. Final image of wrong sky writing anew answers central question resonantly, charging prior motifs like chess secrets. Complexity lingers in fear-wonder friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in poetic notice of "colors that had no names" and shadow averting; rhythmic control modulates from climb tension to summit poise. Stable first-person distance biases toward thief's reckless reverence, no leakage. Voice as character: syntax reflects cautious abandon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with lines like "light did not pour out; instead, questions did" advancing image and revelation; varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful and coherent, no muddle in peak (lid click onward). Ear-test clean, minimal modifiers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thief archetype with wonder-apprentice via chess-secret swap transforms tropes; icewood king offering personal fear risks bold vulnerability. Non-obvious CR in lid's questions inevitability grows from climb particulars. Voice commits fully to lyrical thievery without hedging.</comment>
