<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete embodiment (chest rising with fog, palm chill seeping bones) and contradictory impulses acting in the self-loss worry moment, resolved by grounding promise that earns the merge with visible translucence cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sextant hum to breathing sync to mirror corridor, landing Charged Poise closure in "erasing boundaries... dream and maker" with legible self-loss cost; orientation anchored by ~50 words, no drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ruined orchard's fog and frost constrain choices (as breathing partner, misting glass) and charge final flare image; sensory hierarchy (fog's exhalation, glass-mountain branches) filters through mirror-maker's detail-noticing bias, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream) signaled early tightens accumulatively via self-paling reversal, forcing endurance trade-off; cost unmistakable in "face went pale, then translucent" altering tactics to grounding anchor before merge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Erasing boundaries theme emerges organically from breathing sync and mirror merge, final corridor-figure image reweighting self/other premise without statement; resonant ambiguity lingers in flare-to-dim cadence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (details like "frozen apple pulp," "teeth from a shattered smile") biases via mirror-maker lens; rhythmic control modulates from steady sync to peak compression in merge beat, stable close third-person.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels (multi-job lines like "breathed onto it; the fog... misting evenly"); varied rhythm, coherent metaphors (glass mountains to ribs), no loops/artifacts dulling closure flare.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirror-trap dream-capture via fog-sync transforms surreal tropes; risk in boundary-erase payoff feels inevitable from sextant crack setup, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
