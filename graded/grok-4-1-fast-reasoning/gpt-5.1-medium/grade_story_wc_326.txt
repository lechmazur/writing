<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied obsession (heartbeat tallies constraining focus) and earned shift from linear guilt to nonlinear acceptance; final realization "together we are writing who she will become" reveals hierarchy of values with conceptual cost. Contradictory impulses act in the ink-reading beat, compelling the coding choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from static/heartbeats to ink patterns fracturing/resolving into voice; closure as Charged Poise RR lands on-page with cost in imperfect co-creation ("patches missing, but the gaps feel less like loss"). Ink insight to new algorithm provides one decisive tightening; orientation anchored immediately in dome/observatory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (creaking dome, clawing wind, dimming lights) constrains coding beat and charges final opalescent reflections; porcelain shard and spilled ink as micro-settings mirror internal chaos productively. POV bias filters through scientist's pattern-seeking (snowflakes pixelated).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resurrect Lian before shutdown) signaled early, escalates via ink-deepening that forces algorithmic renunciation with visible cost (choking processors, incomplete voice); agency in wiping notes/coding narrows options under accumulative lens, charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear wisdom from failure emerges organically through ink constellations and voice glitches reweighting resurrection; final image offers non-literal answer ("writing who she will become") resonating with prior chaos patterns without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in rhythmic, looping syntax reflecting obsessive mind ("leapt, looped, circled"); stable single POV with lyric compression taught early pays off in waveform/voice emergence; her brief dialogue carries exasperated idiom distinct from narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm (short heartbeat counts amid long lyric sentences); coherent metaphors (ink as constellations/algorithms, ice cracking/refreezing) enhance without muddling closure; no loops, scaffold, or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic resurrection error, ink-derived nonlinear AI revival, and co-creation theme transforms digital ghost trope; ink spill turn feels inevitable from established pattern-seeking, with risk-taking in lyric sci-fi heightening closure stakes.</comment>
