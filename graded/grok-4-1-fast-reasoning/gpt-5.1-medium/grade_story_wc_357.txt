<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solid interiority through embodied sensations like "fingertips on bark" and "breath slow," with motivation intensifying via fear of guardians, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in a pivotal choice before the final reach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from water trails to echoes to arrow, delivering on-page Conceptual Repricing at "The arrow was a seed of intention" with conceptual cost of reweighted planetary defiance; orientation anchored early in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Floating arches and rising water constrain navigation and charge the hollow's final image; sensory hierarchy (sap glow, stone memory smell) filters through pilot's priorities, evolving causally with inversion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (source of resilience) signaled early tightens accumulatively via moss growth and echoes forcing realization; agency in pursuit culminates in touch with legible conceptual cost reweighting endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of defiance fueling resilience emerges organically from water's impressions and arrow's pulse, with final CR image resonating without moralizing; recurring cycles (loss to fuel) recharge particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in tactile cues like "wind on eyelids"; rhythmic diction modulates from whirling drift to bone-echoes under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors (e.g., "shadows like sleeping serpents"); minor figurative density in moss beat but pattern-taught without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inverted gravity orchards and intention-seed arrow feels inevitable; bold world logic (rivers climb, roots drink sky) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
