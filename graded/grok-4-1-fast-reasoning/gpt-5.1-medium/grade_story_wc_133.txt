<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's wry earnestness about omens creates contradictory impulses acting in scene, compelling the brooch trade decision with visible cost of leaving; interiority particular via painting unsleeping world. Final choice earned by prior causality of insomnia and meaning-threshing life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from tide failure to brooch find to checkpoint exchange; closure as Charged Poise CR in guard's nod reconfigures worlds with conceptual cost of exchanged hungers. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via brooch suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tidal island and rain trails constrain choices (road walk, brooch seabed find) and charge final image of gleaming stones as vertebrae; sensory hierarchy painterly, details evolve causally with tide. Micro-setting (boots squelching) mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thresh meaning via brooch for relief) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through village reaction narrowing to trade journey; agency in offering brooch forecloses island stasis with felt cost at checkpoint. Pressure coheres under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preserved past trading for future reprieve emerges via brooch convergence particulars, reweighted non-literally in ending exchange image; ambiguity lingers in omen belief without tidy moral. Resonance from character conflict inextricable with lost seas motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with painterly perceptual signature (e.g., "clouds... color of a bruise"); voice rhythmic, modulates intensity lyrically; dialogue subtextual (Eron's tease-accusation pursues practicality goal). No head-hopping, diction POV-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative density (e.g., "gravid with more promises than rain") borders overwrite in opening beats without obscuring closure; no loops, strong verbs propel. Propulsion clear to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh post-wars synthesis of fossilized insect as omen-bridge transforms ecological trope via painter's gaze; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from island-to-mainland arc.</comment>
