<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority concrete and particular, with embodied shame ("hot as the air above the street lamps") revealing flaws and contradictory impulses between honoring histories and past softening of testimonies. Painter alchemist applies targeted pressure via dialogue and teaching. Final renunciation of neutrality earned through shard's tug and realization, foreclosing prior habits with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images and revelations builds from market walk to passage teaching to shard payoff. Orientation anchored early in market/POV. Conceptual Repricing closure via shard's images and shame reconfigures translation premise with undeniable cost in "shame rose hot," no slips touching ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (swaying boards, rattling glass, condensed dusk fingers) filtered through translator's notice of unsaid, constraining path (outermost stall, hanging canvases). Setting guides choices (unfasten hook) and charges final shared breath image. Micro-objects like hooks and shard evolve causally, mirroring internal anchors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor overlooked histories via anchors) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through teaching and unfasten beat that deepens knowledge of silenced voices. Agency in seeking/walking/unfastening forces trade-off with past shame cost, legible in chest tug and hot shame. Single intensification reweights stake under lens, charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unsaid histories emerges organically from painting details, shard images, and shame realization, reweighting translation work without statement. Final thresholds image offers resonant non-literal answer to overlooked anchors' necessity. Particulars like chipped cup/scuffed boot avoid platitudes, inviting ambiguity in intuition's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with perceptual signature (noticing unsaid in tilts/distances). Voice lyrical yet biased toward translation metaphors, modulating rhythm with pressure (short sentences in unfasten beat). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You came back... Not back"), distinct from narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (light/weight/breath motifs) taught early, no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies (long poetic builds to shard's crisp "shivered, letting fall"). Propulsion clear in sequence, zero artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of literary fantasy market as intuition anchor-source transforms translator trope via painting footnotes and literal shard. Bold lyric compression risks poetic density but heightens stakes/coheres under textural lens. Final shame reweighting inevitable from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
