<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in smelting process where librarian accepts molten contradictions side-by-side, earning the final reweaving choice with embodied cost in furnace gears. Fisherman's fluctuating gazes reveal character under pressure without stereotypes. Final micro-choice to hand back lighter creel fuses traits authentically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from creel discovery to smelting intensification, landing Charged Poise closure in lighter creel and mutual reflection swap with legible cost of perpetual fluctuation. Orientation anchored early in atrium introduction; single scene coherent. No causality breaks; pattern pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Tidal atrium constrains via rising water lapping shelves and submerged steps, charging final reflection in high water. Sensory hierarchy (salt-moonlight creel, sloshing waves) reflects librarian's priorities; wintersun serenity evolves with moonlight thickening. Micro-setting (glass bones) mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to archive unbound selves tightens accumulatively through contradiction density and fisherman's return, narrowing to acceptance that forecloses tidy unity with cost of lighter-but-whole creel. Agency in smelting forces trade-off; pressure coheres to Charged Poise. Escalation driven by on-page deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder amid contradictory identities emerges organically from smelting contradictions, resonant in final image where repetition meets curiosity without moralizing. Mutual reflection migration reweights premise non-literally. Complexity lingers in unresolved fluctuation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tidal-metaphor diction and rhythmic modulation (short waves in smelting heat) heightens pressure; first-person stable with no leakage. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("Have you seen my day?"). Voice embodies hinge-hearted librarian throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "moonlight thickens; it always does when the moon is missing"); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language pattern-taught early, coherent in peak smelting beat. No artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of migrating selves and smelting contradictions transforms identity tropes into fresh conceptual frame; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reflection swap inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
