<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's specialty in slipping questions under certainty shown through concrete micro-choices like shard use and chime translation; Mara's contradictory fear and insistence on verdict create internal conflict embodied in flinching and loosening shoulders, earning Charged Poise with unerasable choice cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as chime patterns and mirror deepen density toward RR/Charged Poise closure; "the choice unerasable" delivers legible conceptual cost in final image; orientation anchored early in path to lighthouse at dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wind chimes and drafts constrain listening method and charge dawn/mirror interplay in closure image; sensory selection (salt wind, tinkling metal) mirrors guarded vulnerability without overt symbolism; micro-setting shard frames moving air to hollow glare.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of injecting doubt into certainty signaled early, tightens via fear revelation and chimes' "no clean heroism" under Accumulative lens; Mara's agency in whisper forecloses tidy absolution with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of nuance over certainty emerges organically from chimes/shard events, reweighted in final "something softer has entered" without moralizing; subtext in "sincerely insincere" echoes ambiguity charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in metaphors like "certainty on the hook" and chime "verbs"; dialogue subtextual ("make it stick") pursues goals; stable first-person modulates rhythm with pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short revelation sentences amid lyrical); minor metaphor density in opening ("thin glass and guarded secrets") purposeful but borders overwrite; no loops, high density propels to chill-thinning closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh "conscience for hire" premise transformed via chimes as language and hollow shard; risk of lyric elision pays off in spinning-coin image reweighting doubt/nuance.</comment>
