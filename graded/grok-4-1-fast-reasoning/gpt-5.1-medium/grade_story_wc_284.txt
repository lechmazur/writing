<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in Elias's stubborn arrival despite being burned ("some part of him stubbornly insisted") and peak in the earned choice to wait rather than rush, revealing hierarchy of values with cost of foreclosed revenge. Interiority particular via spy habits persisting amid doubt. No unearned epiphanies; change anchors in micro-choices like decoding snow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via layered discoveries (pillbox code to snow patterns to twin pillbox), culminating in Charged Poise closure where clinking pillboxes reconfigure past failures into pact, with legible emotional cost in throat tightening. Orientation anchors early (cliff, mist, spring tilt). Single scene coherent, one tightening at glint revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist and fog constrain choices (swallows sound, reveals paths/glint selectively) and charge final image (thinning to "living noises of approaching spring"). Sensory hierarchy spy-specific (notices boot prints, depressions). Selective details like "silver hush" mirror internal hush, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve Mara's fate via broken loyalty) signaled early, texturally deepens through snow decoding narrowing to key's implication, forcing endurance over action. Agency in descent/kneeling forecloses rush path with felt cost (past burns reweighted). One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres to Charged Poise without abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fixing broken emerges organically via pillboxes/snow codes shifting to "Fix what breaks," resonating in final wait that reweights failures without moralizing. Subtext in Mara's heresy vs. Bureau cuts invites ambiguity. Final image answers central question (courage's locus) non-literally, inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with spy perceptual signature (watching "everything," hush as "word he had not yet spoken"). Rhythmic prose modulates intensity (short sentences in descent). No head-hopping; elision of key's door purposeful, paid in realization. Distinct texture in syntax evokes mist-bound caution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "wind rose, threading fingers of cold" advances setting/action/atmosphere). Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; no loops, coherent metaphors (mechanical whale skeleton). Zero artifacts; propulsion peaks in "He slipped the new pillbox... clinking like distant glasses."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Snow codes and pillbox twins transform burned-spy trope into textural quest for quiet courage, fresh via lyric hush modulating to spring. Risky Charged Poise ending inevitable from particulars. No derivative echoes; synthesis of codes/failures feels organic and bold.</comment>
