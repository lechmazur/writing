<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in defiant substitution over salvation, embodied in "shivers along his skin" demanding accounting; final endurance earned via child's ash memory tilting present choice. Micro-choices like palm on glass reveal values hierarchy with cost. 9+ test met: impulses act in chambers, renunciation visible at dimming clock.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: nested patterns density builds from shelves to chambers, reconfiguring doom via ripples to Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "vastness of what would still be lost" as hands erase. Orientation anchored early at lighthouse door; pattern taught by shelves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse constrains (door sequence, pedestal substitution); puppet charges final image facing sea. Sensory hierarchy (brine/dust first, then thrumming bird) reflects urgency. 9+ gate met: recurring lighthouse/puppet shapes tactics and end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mercy tilt vs. halt) signaled via puppet carry; textural escalation via chamber adjustments narrowing to quivering hands, humming reprise. Agency in "loosening a cruel word here, a bullet there" with visible cost in partial burning world. Cost unmistakable at "bruised awe."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of withheld tenderness emerges organically from puppet tilt, nested mercies; final image (puppet by sea, sirens late) resonant non-literal answer reweighting doom premise. No moralizing, ambiguity in partial loss lingers. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable 3rd-limited perceptual signature (patterns as lives/choices) biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from hush slide to quivering hands. No elision opacity; prose texture mythic-poetic, consistent under stress. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "every mark described someone who had loved, failed...") propels without loops; metaphors cohere in ripples/nested light. Varied rhythm peaks at "clock hands quivered, uncertain." Zero artifacts dull closure; 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: clock as tenderness ledger, puppet defiance tilts doomsday via nested mercies, inevitable in hindsight. Bold lyric nesting heightens stakes organically. Transformation of tropes (lighthouse/doom) via flaw/grace.</comment>
