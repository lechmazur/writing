<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation intensifies through embodied hesitation at scars and confession of bridge-burning, earning the final breath as micro-choice with cost. Shadow keeper applies pressure via palm-offer, revealing her pattern. Minor abstraction in "ghosts of old cuts" slightly dilutes embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry to scar-linking memories, culminating in Charged Poise closure—"Breathe" widens ribs, reconfiguring threshold with felt cost in final inhalation. Orientation anchored early (warehouse edge, sanctuary). No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ashen charcoal walls and starlight constrain path and blur into horizon at climax, charging final image. Dust path and eye-knocker integrate tactilely via warm metal and static skin. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's loaded emptiness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (breathe amid self-imposed isolation) signaled early, tightens via scar-memories revealing arrival pattern, forcing stance shift. Agency in palm-choice and inhalation forecloses hovering with rib-space cost. One deepening suffices under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of chosen isolation reweights via scars showing sanctuary's prior presence, answered non-literally in bridge "burn[ing] in a different direction." Emerges organically from particulars without moralizing. Resonant ambiguity in save/drown lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature: thresholds "flicker along her skin," biases toward ghosts/smoke. Prose rhythm modulates from hitching breath to widening inhale. Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven: "You came late" tests confession.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful in accumulative texture (e.g., "dust like soft gray snow"), coherent without muddle. Minor river/swallow strain in lungs but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow guardian and scar-memory linking transforms isolation trope; risk in lyric sanctuary frame heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight: bridges pool breath calling her here. No derivative echoes.</comment>
