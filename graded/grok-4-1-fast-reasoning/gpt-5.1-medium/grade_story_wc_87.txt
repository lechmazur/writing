<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses (surrender vs. paddle back) acting in the turning beat; final renunciation earned by prior compass alignment failure and barnacle observation. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "merrily melancholic" borders therapy-speak but embodies buoyancy without flattening pressure. Flaws complicate choices without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via observations (poles, barnacles) to Charged Poise closure in kayak turn and compass-as-metronome image ("thumped against my chest with each stroke"), reconfiguring regrets from wave to rain with felt emotional cost legible in final lines. Orientation anchored early (kayak ramp, fog, bay). One tightening (barnacle micro-turn) sufficient; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Utility poles, barnacles, compass constrain choices (navigation path, light-seeking metaphor) and charge final image (shore smudge reappearing). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (navigator notices poles' "concrete feet," wires as "muted constellations"). Details tactile and evolved (fog swallows shore, then reappears); micro-setting (kayak hull wobble) mirrors internal balance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (align heart/action amid regrets) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via barnacle realization forcing stance crystallization in turn; agency in paddle reversal forecloses vanishing path with cost (paddling "through" rain of regrets). Pressure coheres under lens without reversal overload; visible price in imperfect heart alters tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of flickering faith emerges organically from particulars (compass fraud, barnacle spirals, pole navigation) to resonant non-literal answer in final paddle-toward-them image reweighting premise (regrets navigable imperfectly). Subtext in implication (Granddad's wisdom via barnacles); no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in "undecided" heart.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (surveyor metaphors: "channels on a failing GPS," "surveyor's line"); rhythmic control modulates from drift to stroke-driven propulsion. Stable single-POV with biased noticing (poles over stars); purposeful compression in lyric reflections legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "disk jerked, stuck... accusing the heart" advances character/action/metaphor); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops. Minor figurative density in reflective beats (e.g., regrets as "spring tide") borders overwrite but pattern-taught early and pays off texturally; no muddle or scaffold in turn/ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveyor regret via kayak/poles/compass transforms midlife trope; barnacle turn inflects organically from established navigation obsession. Bold lyric risk in Accumulative texture heightens stakes without gimmick; specific coastal details (peeling sign, barnacle spirals) anchor universals.</comment>
