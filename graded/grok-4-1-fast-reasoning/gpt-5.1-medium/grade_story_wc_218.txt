<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "brazen calm" amid chest pain and death sentence, with micro-choices like gentle wiring earning final endurance; interiority particular via architect's lens on stone/roots.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as wiring experiments build density to storm's unlock and CR closure ("everything negotiated peace"), with death as felt cost; orientation anchored early, one tightening via lightning suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pillars "veined with moss, hollow with architectural secrets" constrain wiring choices and charge final "branches and stone lips"; sensory hierarchy (ozone, hum, vibrations) filters through POV expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (remodel for respect pre-death) tightens texturally via birds/storm deepening resonances, agency in experiments; cost legible in "chest steady in its betrayal" and death foreclosing paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies pacts emerges via particulars (wires subtitling root/stone talk), final image reweights premise non-literally as death enables peace without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in architect's synesthesia ("clock chiming underwater," "pillars shivered"); rhythmic control modulates from calm sketches to storm's "grinding sigh," stable close third.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (e.g., "living circuitry") without muddle in peak storm beat, propulsion varies rhythm naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of dying architect wiring nature for dialogue transforms tropes; risk in lyric textural build heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via pillar "answer without cracking."</comment>
