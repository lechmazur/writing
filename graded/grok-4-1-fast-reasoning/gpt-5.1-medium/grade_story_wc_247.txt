<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion in signing painful memories like "lonely birthdays" and contradictory joy/sorrow at close; Lena's traits consistently drive micro-choices. Advisor applies light pressure but lacks crucible depth. Final laugh earns change via prior causality without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from signing to thickened silence resolving in CR via "melodies rise... threaded with moonlight." On-page closure with emotional cost legible in unfolding score. Orientation anchored early; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight and breakwater edge constrain signing action at "stepped to the edge... closed her eyes." Sensory hierarchy (ripples, steam, clink) reflects Lena's silence-focus. Camera as micro-setting charges final click-chord.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence to music) signaled early, deepens via signed memories narrowing to "silence thickened... wove it." Agency in hands falling trembling; cost felt in "sorrow... real, but... joy." Lens escalation via cadence shift to laugh.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of framed silence-as-music emerges via camera/signing particulars, reweighted in "harmonized with the silence." Final image answers without moralizing. Resonance from memories to coherent score avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in signing shadows and silence-weaving. Voice rhythm modulates to peak compression in "hands finally fell, trembling." Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("disturb its echo").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Dense metaphors ("bowl of spilled stars") coherent in lyric pattern, but slight overwrite dulls one high-pressure signing beat. Propulsion clear to resolving "click... chord."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: empty camera "exposes" signed silence into music with advisor. Risky mystic signing transforms tropes; inevitable hindsight from harbor setup to harmonized laugh.</comment>
