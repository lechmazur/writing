<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in time-obsession compel the final step with contradictory impulses (heart's warning vs. reverie), embodied in clutching the halo and fraying outline; minor abstraction in epiphanies like "texture of time" slightly unearned but does not touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from garden pulses to lattice realization; CR closure lands on-page in disintegration image ("our histories smeared into one quaking reverie") with conceptual cost of dissolution legible; orientation anchored early in first stanza.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry and pulsing roots constrain walks and final step, charging closure image; selective sensory details (sap prints, bruising sky) filter through designer's reverie, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (time's texture) signaled early tightens texturally via lattice deepening ("every moment touching many others"), forcing disintegration agency with dissolution cost felt in fraying cells; no slips at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of time as porous lattice emerges organically from particulars (photos, halo flickers, smeared hands); final CR reweights premise without moral, resonant in "histories smeared into one quaking reverie."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (time as drums, lattice) stable in first-person; rhythmic modulation under stress (shortened clauses in final steps) heightens pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; minor overwriting in light/remembering metaphors accumulates coherently without muddling peak ("light spills downward"); no loops or scaffolds dull final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic mazes, living bridges, and time-lattice transforms reverie tropes; risk-taking in nonlinear memories heightens stakes, inevitable in disintegration closure.</comment>
