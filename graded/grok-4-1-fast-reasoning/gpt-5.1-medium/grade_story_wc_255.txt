<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "old ache of temptation; this was impossible, which made it irresistible," compelling the closure painting with visible cost in pursuing imperfection over forgiveness. Interiority particular and embodied throughout. Minor reputation summary early slightly abstracts but doesn't touch pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from courtyard textures to phoenix ash, reed's sound, culminating in RR closure ("reed fell silent, and the plant bloomed") reweighting imperfection with felt cost of bearing the wound. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ash-glowing cobblestones, potted vines, kiln-warm air selectively constrain barter and painting, mirroring internal states via POV bias (textures/temperatures). Plant on sill charges final bloom image, evolving with action. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("paint something that cannot be forgiven into something that can be borne") signaled via pots, tightens accumulatively through temptation and painting agency, foreclosing forgiveness path with cost in "honoring every hesitation." Pressure coheres to Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in imperfection emerges organically from barter, reed's warp, asymmetrical painting; final image non-literally reweights "awakenings" premise without moralizing. Subtext in plant conspirators and silent reed carries ambiguity. No tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (no colors, only "textures and temperatures of light"); rhythmic lyricism modulates to peak compression in painting beat. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, advances stakes. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but dense metaphors in painting ("vessel that was also a throat, also a bird, also a bruise") verge on overload without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; strong verbs/images. Minor strain doesn't dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phoenix rebirth, plant-script, phoenix-reed transforms tropes via imperfection stakes; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens closure without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from courtyard patterns to bloom.</comment>
