<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Poet vividly particular via rope-tied backstory and pattern-tracing; narrator's internal conflict crystallizes in life-options unrolling, earning realization with embodied unease. Minor slip in epiphany's directness ("understood that my choices were not between good and evil") borders therapy-speak but ties to prior micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via dialogue-density building to CR closure: narrator's Charged Poise in "The choice was mine alone," reweighting safe vs. expansive paths with conceptual cost of foreclosed texture. Orientation anchored early (highway to grotto); single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto's "wound and a womb" image and cooling clay constrain intimate pressure; rope's "metal and old sweat" recurs tactilely, charging final rustle. Sensory bias (starlight embers, dust patterns) mirrors thematic layers perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of choices post-arrival) signaled early, escalates texturally via poet's escape → layers advice → narrator's life reel, narrowing to agency in expansion vs. shrinkage. Cost legible in optional futures felt via "unrolled before me."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of impossible/third-way choices emerges via rope/prison, dust circles, life options; final image reconfigures "easy automatic" lives non-literally, lingering ambiguity in "choice was mine alone" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature (sky crackling, clay cooling back) biased and consistent; dialogue subtextual (poet's corrections pursue pattern-reveal), distinct idioms (cheerful vs. uneasy laugh). Rhythmic modulation peaks in lowered voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; "ethically playful" reprises purposefully but borders loop (-0.3). No major artifacts; metaphors coherent (auroras torn, histories folded), propel to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: energy beings as witnesses to rope-escape texture transforms tropes; risk in lyric poise (poet's laugh rustling rope) heightens closure stakes organically.</comment>
