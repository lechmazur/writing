<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Refusal to transliterate the raw echo feeling at climax is earned by prior gift's unbidden stirring and life-reflection in goddess's hands, showing contradictory impulses (ask vs. endure) with embodied cost; cool-headed trait balances competence and struggle without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from zigzag advance to frozen hush ring and echo tremor, delivering Charged Poise closure when question dissolves unsaid ("let the question dissolve unsaid") with legible cost in burning spike and new wave rhythms.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rail spike constrains as anchor and voice-conduit, charging final grip-burn; sound wave garden micro-setting pressures zigzag tactics and halts in mute froth, with sensory hierarchy (hiss notes, salt taste) mirroring fisher's transliteration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch echo) tightens via throat arrival and voicing silence under Textural lens, forcing agency in refusal that forecloses question-path with on-page grief-cost and wave reconfiguration; no abstract stakes, all visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reading vs. living emerges organically from transliteration gift turning echo to kneeling figure and reflected life in empty hands, resonant non-literal answer in dissolved question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (emotions as charts/currents/shapes) modulates rhythmically; purposeful lyric compression taught early in wave-chords pays off legibly in echo-shapes, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and no loops; figurative pattern (rippling chords, feral lullaby) taught early coheres without muddle, propelling to peak hush-ring clarity even under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-fishing myth with emotion-transliteration transforms tropes via spike's rail-memory and echo's grief-taste; bold sky-sea pattern risks pay off in inevitable refusal reconfiguration.</comment>
