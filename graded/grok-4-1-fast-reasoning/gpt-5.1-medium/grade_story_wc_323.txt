<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (sleep vs. chain-clink pull) act in scene, compelling the decision to go; final whisper and unclasping earn a visible reconfiguration with cost of reanchored attention. Interiority concrete via navigation metaphors tied to body (ribs ache, mind tilts). Flaws in surface-nostalgia complicate abyssal adaptation without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of star-edge images builds to CR closure in "stood as a navigation instructor between worlds," reweighting horizons with conceptual cost of expansion amid crush. Orientation anchors by para 2; single scene coheres without shards. Persistent chain constraint shapes final image payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Viewport blister and nodule plain constrain the revelation beat; chain as micro-setting charges final frame against "sliver of sky." Sensory hierarchy (humming below hearing, shivering equations) filters via instructor bias. Details evolve causally from dimming to gold lines.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (star navigation) signaled early, tightens via edge-geometry deepening that narrows flat-paper limits; agency in attendance and whisper forecloses old methods with felt mind-tilt cost. Accumulative pressure coheres to Charged Poise. Minor abstractness in future projection slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity-as-tension emerges via chain-to-stars progression, final image non-literally answering horizons question by reweighting absence into direction without moral. Resonance from particulars like "frozen sound" spires mirroring internal ache. Counter-reading (fear vs. wonder) lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in navigational idiom ("unfolded horizons," "thermal currents") biases noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks at viewport dimming. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Show me"), advances via vibration. Stable first-person distance, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors like "tidal flowers" cohere without muddle, rhythm varies (short revelation sentences amid longer builds). No loops or scaffolds; minor overwriting in reflective opens purposeful for textural lens. Final line recharges chain motif crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of abyssal sci-fi with edge-geometry nav transforms tropes via lived chain rust and star-absences; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes. Non-obvious benthic-alien frame inevitable in hindsight, no template echoes.</comment>
