<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in the unfinished equation marked with her initial, compelling the half/half choice that earns closure with visible moral cost in redirecting the network.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries (cylinder, equations) densify to CR closure; "I write my own equation in the margin" reconfigures fair trade with legible breach cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Body as micro-setting constrains unpicking/discovery and charges final stitched image; "cavity is a quiet red cavern" filters through mortician POV, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake tightens via agency-driven deepening (ink loosens to decode lattice), narrowing to trade-off; cost unmistakable in "cut I make with eyes open in the flesh of his design."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image ("his last trick breathes on in different lungs") resonantly reweights "fair trade" premise as living imbalance without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in con-math lens ("numbers no longer cliffs but rivers") sustains under pressure; stable first-person with rhythmic modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density propels (e.g., ink bleeding to decoded lattice); varied rhythm heightens without muddle in peak decode beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of con math in body hiding equations transforms tropes; ink's liquefaction and spine cylinder feel inevitable, risking bold conceptual calculus.</comment>
