<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's interior contradiction between professional skepticism and dream-driven compulsion earns the final healing realization; micro-choices in mapping inscriptions reveal values under Aria's gentle pressure. Aria's counselor role applies relational crucible without stereotypes. Voice distinct in perceptual bias as dream chronicler.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dreams-telegram-observatory map to variable stars' pattern, culminating in CR closure ("I finally witnessed my own healing") with conceptual cost of shared burdens reweighting personal stakes. Single scene anchors orientation early (arrival, midnight); no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dome's red bulbs and telescope constrain mapping choice, charging final image; variable stars' "breathing" mirrors internal discovery through POV-filtered senses. Sensory hierarchy reflects dreamer's priorities, selective and purposeful without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode inscriptions via sky) signaled early, tightens via pattern of catastrophes emerging under Accumulative lens, narrowing to shared burdens trade-off; agency in overlaying chart forces stance crystallization with felt relational cost in Aria's tremor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shared burdens emerges organically from star-inscription matches ("We carried this so you would not have to"), reweighting premise in final image without moralizing; ambiguity in "clumsily dictate a letter" invites reflection via concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature ("dreams had begun to outvote my waking life") biases noticing, stable distance modulates to intimacy; dialogue subtextual ("Here your dreams are the data"), natural rhythm advances stakes with distinct idioms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm ("clocks surrendered to midnight"); figurative language purposeful in lyric mode without muddle, though occasional elevation ("hollow of midnight solace") borders overwrought but supports tone. No loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Variable stars as temple ledger transforms dream-trope into fresh celestial cartography of suffering; risk in elliptical Accumulative drive pays off in hindsight-inevitable CR, committing fully without hedging.</comment>
