<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—protecting absent trains yet cultivating sparks—act simultaneously in patrols and clock-placing; final singing earns endurance as Charged Poise, foreclosing erasure of the dead with conceptual cost legible in "stopping feels like erasing the dead."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from ghost tracks to sparks diving into clocks; Conceptual Repricing closure at "oceanic tick of wave functions collapsing" reconfigures persistence with undeniable cost of cradles snapping shut, cost proof in final ear-to-glass image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dune constrains choices via ridges walked nightly and unlit corners for clocks; recurring sand grains charge final humming image, sensory hierarchy (bioluminescent glow, warm sand) filtered through guard's rail-memory bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of witnessing unchosen paths tightens accumulatively as sparks circle clocks and flags twitch, forcing endurance; agency in whispering schedules narrows to singing gaps, cost unmistakable in dune's easier breath post-echo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of persistence amid absence emerges organically from sparks' dives and other selves aligning; final dune-humming offers non-literal answer reweighting loneliness into charm without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tracks of possibility bruising the air") biases toward rail-ghosts and sparks; rhythmic control modulates from steady patrols to fractured syntax in peak whispers, stable first-person distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "chess clock frozen at midnight, half-buried in warm sand" advances plot/atmosphere); purposeful lullaby motif avoids loops, varied rhythm propels to charged final image unscathed by minor metaphor density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Post-fire dune as divergent archive of possibilities transforms freight-guard trope via sparks and wave functions; risk of lyric accumulation heightens stakes in "occasionally everywhere" without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
