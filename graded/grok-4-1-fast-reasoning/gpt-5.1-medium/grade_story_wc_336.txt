<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation from gray city despair roots deeply, with trembling hands and imagined city murals embodying contradictory fear/laughter impulses; final planting choice earned via prior listening and invitation, foreclosing passivity with relational cost to Lior's trust.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density builds from pruning observation to seed visualization surge; closure as Charged Poise in orchard's expansion and "every leaf gleamed," reconfiguring gray hopelessness with felt imaginative cost; oriented by ~50 words, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Verdant parapet and waterfall constrain planting over mist-chasm, charging final brightening hush; sensory weave (bruised leaves, mist cooling face) mirrors internal awakening without catalog; POV bias filters through weary imagination, evolving with causal image-pooling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring wonder signaled early tightens via one deepening: inability to answer hope yields to mural visualization narrowing options from flight to commitment; cost legible in surging warmth and foreclosed gray stasis, coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder-preservation emerges implicitly from pruning/planting particulars, final "branches reaching down into my city" reweighting premise without moral; subtext in Lior's mirror-holding charges resonance over tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature in iridescent threads and backward blossoms biases toward possibility-shades; dialogue subtextual ("whatever you are brave enough to imagine") advances without exposition; rhythmic modulation peaks in visualization surge, stable distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "wind carried... memory steeped in sunlight" advances sense/atmosphere); no loops/artifacts, figurative coherence in light/memory motifs taught early; propulsion varies rhythm to hush-brightening closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of orchard-pruning as world-weaving transforms metaphor tropes via ghost-shivering branches and tear-sized seed; risk in lyric compression heightens imagistic stakes, inevitable in hindsight via persistent wonder-constraint.</comment>
