<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory trembling yet decisive empathy drives key turns, like ear-to-brick listening evolving to choir mediation, earning the final communal harmony with visible costs in weeks of labor and disagreements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as murmurs densify to cascading laughter and city-wide echo; closure as Charged Poise in final plaza image reconfigures isolation with felt structural/emotional cost ("rust aches to let things flow" resolved).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurrent pinecone weight and grain dust constrain choices (chain as pilgrim's thread) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (floury accents, mice smell) mirrors Mara's harmonic priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rehabilitate silo into bridge) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via vibration scattering skepticism to unified work; agency in Mara's palm-pressing diagnostics forecloses isolation with labor/disagreement costs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silos-to-bridges emerges via particulars like language-braiding resolving dissonance; final "one body, many chambers" reweights premise non-literally, charging prior divides without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with musical perceptual signature ("syllables like corn dust") stable in single POV; dialogue subtextual (elevator's multilingual groans advance harmony) and idiomatic, modulating rhythm under rising pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy groans amid lyric swells); purposeful metaphor pattern taught early pays off without muddle, though minor density in peak rehab beats slightly risks propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of talking architecture and choral rehab transforms isolation tropes; risk-taking in multilingual accumulative harmony feels inevitable, with pinecone linking gears to plaza echo.</comment>
