<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses (duty vs. trust in quiet) acting simultaneously in the final beat; renunciation earned via prior logging and mentor recall. Embodied emotions like "counting heartbeats" reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. No stock phrasing; flaws (naivete) complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from logs to shadow pass, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("stepped away... cupped his hands and listened") with legible cost (potential deaths vs. eroded trust). Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, no lens ambiguity. Cost proof: final image reconfigures options undeniably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (dishes "shivered," wind "comb[ing] through his hair") filtered through Elias's priorities constrain choice; rope as micro-setting charges final image. Atmosphere mirrors internal poise; spatial choreography clear. 9+ gate met via recurring dishes/rope shaping climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sound on solstice?) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via readings/shadow, narrowing to trade-off; agency in renunciation forecloses path with felt cost ("some might die"). Pressure coheres under lens; one deepening (patterns "listening back") sufficient and pivotal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (listening over noise) emerges organically from logs, mentor recall, final valley murmur; resonant non-literal answer in ending image reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in silence/gestures; ambiguity lingers plausibly. No Thematic Echo; counter-readings viable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (attuned to "quiet between clicks"); rhythmic modulation builds hush to poise. No head-hopping or withholding; compression purposeful and taught early. Voice texture character-specific, prose reflects mind under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm ("needles jumped, then steadied"); metaphors purposeful without muddle in peak (shadow pass). Minor density slip in opening sky descriptions, but no loops/artifacts touch closure; propulsion clear. Read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: storm tester's solstice zero-hour renunciation transforms listening/noise trope via drowned-rope motif and valley-eavesdrop image. Risk in quiet stasis heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes. Bold perceptual angle inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
