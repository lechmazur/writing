<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied, with motivation rooted in "turbulence nobody logged" intensifying through tremor into earned endurance; final log entry reveals hierarchy of values without tidy epiphany. Contradictory shiver "that did not feel like fear" acts in scene, compelling closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds to tremor as tightening, delivering CR closure in "the sky remembers everything we once believed would fall and vanish" with conceptual cost of embracing unmoored memory. Anchors clear by para 2; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gondola and clouds constrain drift choice and charge final palm-to-glass image; sensory hierarchy (cold brass, creak, tremor) reflects meteorologist bias, evolving with "crosswind no forecast had mentioned."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove atmospheric memory) signaled early, tightens via tremor evidence narrowing options to acceptance; agency in volunteering and logging forecloses grounded safety with felt cost in shiver and drift. Minor abstractness in stakes prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Spooled wholeness emerges organically from particulars, reweighting premise in final image without moralizing; invites ambiguity on grief vs. science via cloud emotions, resonating beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (clouds by emotion, "spooled wholeness") biases noticing; rhythmic compression modulates with pressure (short sentences at tremor), stable close third-person with voice-motivated diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm passing read-aloud; minor overwriting in cloud metaphors ("sullen," "resigned") accumulates texturally without muddling closure image. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aviation grief and atmospheric memory transforms tropes; "empty spaces remember" premise risks bold conceptualism, inevitable in hindsight via tremor payoff.</comment>
