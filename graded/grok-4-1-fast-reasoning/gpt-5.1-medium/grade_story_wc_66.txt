<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lina's copyist precision compels her risky decoding and cloaking, with embodied hope ("secretly luminous, like the dial") earning the shift to shared witness; boy adds pressure without dilution. Interiority concrete, traits alter tactics; minor reflective backstory anchors present without flattening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of ash/mist/radio builds to Charged Poise closure in final shared listening, cost legible in sirens/bootsteps/risk ("mist thick at their backs"); orientation anchored by para 2, one tightening via warning lyric to boy's arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ember alcove/mist constrains hiding (bootsteps "grated on the stone"), radio glow charges secrecy and final swell; dust/ash recurs tactilely, mirroring internal states via goal-action ("smudged fingers"). Sensory hierarchy musical/quiet biases perfect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dust-stories revolution) signaled para 1, deepens accumulatively via decoded instructions to boy confirming success with exposure cost; agency in cloaking/endurance tightens options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of subtle memory-revival emerges via dust/scuffing particulars, reweighted in boy's "shimmer" and shared "thistled calm" without statement; resonant CR in final image answers famine premise obliquely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (music/silence bias: "minor third and suspended chord"); voice rhythmic/poetic modulates cleanly to peak ("leaned into the thistled calm"); boy's whisper natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short warning para vs. lush openings); purposeful metaphors ("gray snow," "thistled calm") pattern-taught without muddle or loops; minor repetition of "luminous" charges closure positively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pirate-song instructions for dust-stories post-famine transforms tropes organically; boy's arrival turn inevitable from mixture/causality; bold lyric synthesis risks poetic compression that heightens stakes.</comment>
