<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's contradictory fear of his body's reversal and withholding as precise misleading compel the lesson's core choice; Mora's obedience reveals hierarchy of values in her widened self. Final bow and inner hollow earn stasis with embodied cost. Backwards aging trait anchors motivation without exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ripple density building to Charged Poise closure in "shape of a self that might choose not to return," with legible cost in "painful and bright" rush back. Single scene anchors orientation by para 2; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto's hum aligns ripples, constraining trance; platform sways imperceptibly, charging final tug on Mora's hollow. Sensory hush and metallic water taste filter through Elian's ancient intent, mirroring dilution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proper vanishing) deepens accumulatively through rings thinning certainty, narrowing to renunciation of spectacle with cost in glimpsed erasure. Agency in breath-matching spaces forecloses hasty path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of withheld vanishing emerges via rings' questions and final "who she would choose to be," reweighting premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("air thinned, listening") modulates with trance intensity; sparse dialogue carries subtext ("why bring me here" vs. "how I withhold"). Stable close-third focalization biases toward ancient eyes' caution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety peaks in ripple spread ("intersecting, trembling like questions"); no loops, high density integrates image/action. Minor figurative density ("slower than rust") purposeful, not muddled in trance beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Backwards-aging researcher transforms vanishing trope via ripple method and withholding calculus; risk of lyric accumulation heightens stakes in self-dilution image.</comment>
