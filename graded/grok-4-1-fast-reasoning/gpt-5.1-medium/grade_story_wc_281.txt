<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the hovering hand and chest-focus amid buzzing overload; Naya's skepticism forces Eli's micro-choice to "treat this like a design problem," earning the final redirection with relational cost. Interiority particular through somatic buzz and pathway cobwebs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds from static buzz to unfurling light-threads vision, landing Charged Poise closure in the settling hum and "studio becomes our compass" with persistent ethical tug as cost. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Studio's projector glow and fiber brushes constrain the vision's fractal lines, charging final image; geode sliver as micro-setting flares sympathetically, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to aim the overload tightens via shared vision beat, narrowing from intrusion to guided nudge; agency in intention-reaching forecloses uncontrolled paths with legible cost in "nudged their paths too" and ongoing hum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of pathways-from-pry-to-guide emerges implicitly via tangled knots loosening, final "return the light" image reweighting pill's intrusion without moralizing; willowglass hope motif shifts from fragile to flexible tool.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "feather-touch awareness" and light-path drifts; dialogue subtextual ("haunted corridors") advances while Naya's idiom contrasts Eli's lyricism, stable close-third POV modulates seamlessly under visionary pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in varying rhythms like "shapes hung behind his eyelids, drifting lines"; purposeful lyric figuration (fractally precise) coherent, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure hum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Somatic telepathy post-static shock synthesizes light-painting performance into fresh pattern-tool premise; risky accumulative vision unfurls organically from prior show, transforming ethical intrusion without retreat.</comment>
