<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict—barbed words vs. apologetic touches—shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, earning her final listening choice; pirate applies sharp pressure via dialogue and gesture. Grace emerges through embodied micro-choices like carrying crates with hips. Minor slip: epiphany at "harbor rise inside her" borders on unearned, but prior strain anchors it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: atmospheric density builds from pier bundle to boat reveal, culminating in Charged Poise closure when Mara hears the whale's song as her true nature, with conceptual cost of self-burial. Orientation anchored early at harbor edge. Two-shard structure (pier/dusk boat) transitions legibly via Mara's return choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe and skiff constrain choices (low tide timing, rowing into thinning world), charging final image; sensory details like "pilings sweated cold" and "seaweed rose like drowned banners" filter through Mara's dock bias. Weather/tide evolve causally, mirroring internal softening. No slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (skepticism vs. belief in hidden truths/island) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pirate's explanations and bone press, forcing Mara's endurance of doubt into stance crystallization. Agency in returning/holding bone; cost felt in "refused yourself" realization. One deepening suffices, no reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of post-violence "sharper words and softer hands" emerges organically from pirate's lattice/nets explanation and Mara's grace-from-strain arc, resonating in final non-literal image of whale song as true nature. Subtext in silences (blank island) invites ambiguity without confusion. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV to Mara with distinct perceptual signature (tidal metaphors, embodied aches); pirate's gravel idiom contrasts Mara's softening internals. Dialogue goal-driven (teasing baptism splash pursues trust). Rhythmic control modulates to compression at "hold the bone to your ear."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors consistent (water/tide pattern) without muddle in closure beat. Minor density slip in opening ("moved like water...measured as a tide") risks overwrite but taught early as voice. No loops, clean syntax variety supports read-aloud rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-violence world (lattices/nets) transforms pirate trope into scrimshaw-island-self metaphor, with disappearing isle/whale call as non-obvious reweighting grown from particulars. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmick; inevitable in hindsight at bone-to-ear moment.</comment>
