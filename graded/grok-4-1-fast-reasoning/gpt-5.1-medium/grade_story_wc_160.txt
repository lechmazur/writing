<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Arlen's interiority shines in concrete details like reading saliva adhesive and encrypted compassion belief, driving micro-choices like laying the chain; council applies pressure but borders archetypal. Final tremble and proposal earn change with vulnerability shown. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from Arlen's pacing to council clashes to chain adjustment into circle (RR closure). Orientation anchored early in amphitheater. Cost legible in "rotating mercy" and chest alignment click, with constraint of chain's fixed length shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amphitheater and volcano constrain via breathing motif mirroring restraint, charging final dust settling; chain as micro-setting enables demo. Sensory details (dust tumble, chain tug) filtered through machinist's bias. Satisfies 9+ test with setting shaping choice and image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonize values) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via clashes to proposal narrowing options; agency in Arlen's demo forces crystallization. Cost visible in shared adjustments foreclosing permanent winners. Escalation coherent under lens, driven by proposal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of compassion in systems emerges organically via chain demo and rotating gates; final circle image resonantly answers without moralizing, reweighting conflicts. Satisfies 9+ test with non-literal reconfiguration of prior flood metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in machinist metaphors (valves, currents); dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (scoffs vs. demands). Rhythm modulates tension to silence. Distinct council voices via roles; 9+ test met with signature under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring breaths; purposeful "building breathes" repetition taught early without loops. Minor figurative density in clashes but coherent, no artifacts dulling closure chain image. Satisfies 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of machinist fixing social "floods" via literal chain transforms tropes organically; volcano/amphitheater risks bold metaphor payoff in alignment. Inevitable hindsight from particulars; risk heightens stakes (+0.3).</comment>
