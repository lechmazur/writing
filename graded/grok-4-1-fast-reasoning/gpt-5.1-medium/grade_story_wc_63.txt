<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Earned shift from personal penance to shared stewardship via contradictory impulses (polishing minutes vs. facing tide) culminates in covenant, with embodied cost ("scorched, searing through my chest"). Interiority concrete and particular, rake handle anchoring flaw. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("I realized") doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to pause's pattern break, yielding CR closure ("covenant... invite apprentices") with conceptual cost (solitary avoidance foreclosed). Orientation anchored early (tower, ridge). Single scene fits defaults, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pendulum bob and rake handle constrain choices (winding, thumbing symbols) and charge final image (shiver yields to descent). Obsidian ridge mirrors internal states via memory, sensory hierarchy POV-specific (time presses like fevered hands). Vivid, selective integration into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (balance restoration via precision) signaled early, deepens in pause via agency (insight rejects avoidance), foreclosing solitary path with scorching cost under Accumulative lens. One tightening reweights to shared duty, legible in covenant plan.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (brother's death, rake, winding): absolution repriced as shared via final resonant image (future etched into new hands). No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "if it ever came." Protagonist arc inextricable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (time as "fevered hands," sea undertow) with rhythmic control modulating to charged poise at close. Stable first-person POV, no elision issues; prose texture reflects obsessive mind. Elevated diction voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel through pause; metaphors purposeful (clock spring snapping) without muddle in peak (realization). Minor paraphrase ("incremental absolution/avoidance") contained, not looping closure. No scaffold or artifacts dulling image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock-time as guilt's mechanism, transformed via rake's inscriptions and pendulum pause into searing reverie. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes; irreplaceable obsidian/tide particulars anchor universals. No derivative echoes.</comment>
