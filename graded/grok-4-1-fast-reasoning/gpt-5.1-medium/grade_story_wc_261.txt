<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in scar-as-chapter metaphor and reopening impulse; contradictory drive to close via surgery yields earned CR shift. Plants' voices force micro-choices revealing flaws without safety-hedging. Final realization reframes her as reader, not closer, with embodied cost in scalp touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from ivy voice to coffee-ring visions to CR closure: "some closures bloom only when you stop trying to seal them." Orientation anchored in opening lines; one tightening via visions suffices with legible cost in reframed identity. No ambiguity at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory weave (damp green voice, rustling consonants) integrates setting into pressure; coffee ring as micro-setting constrains observation and charges visions. Tower dawn hush mirrors internal meteor hush, evolving causally to sky brightening. Body/scar details bias perception character-specifically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (surgery for silence yields plant voices) signaled early; textural escalation via rosemary's whisper and ring visions deepens to foreclose closing wounds. Agency in observation/laughter narrows options; cost legible in "who tends the living hurt" retort unanswered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of displaced miracles emerges organically from surgery/mentor parallels to plant-taught scar-reading; final hush image reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in ivy offense and rosemary's "sunlight got in" yields resonant ambiguity on closure's bloom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (synesthetic voices as smells/rustles) modulates with intensity; diction/rhythm distinct and biased (scar orbits). Purposeful compression in visions legible under lens; no head-hopping or withhold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful (e.g., "key, not a lock") taught early without muddle in peak vision beat. Minor overwrite in stacked images offset by propulsion; no loops or scaffolds dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanic telepathy and scar-crater astronomy transforms closure tropes; coffee-ring scars as temporal anomaly risks bold payoff in CR hush. Non-obvious displaced miracle angle feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
