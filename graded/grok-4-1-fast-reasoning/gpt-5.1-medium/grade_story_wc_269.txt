<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's coral-diving past grounds tapping habit and motivation to probe ocean paths, with contradictory impulses in "pretend they are less fragile" yielding earned final endurance. Interiority concrete via embodied taps pulling from blur. Micro-choices like folding page and testing rhythms reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns of observation, page find, lab share build to tapping cadence shift as Charged Poise closure, glimpsing sandbar then loss reconfigures ocean-memory premise with fragility cost. Orientation anchored early (station roof, tides). One tightening via page-to-tapping linkage suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Station roof/rail, intake grate, tide table constrain choices and charge final swell/sandbar image; sensory hierarchy (hums, scars, taps) POV-biased to rhythms. Details evolve (flicker ties to tap). Micro-setting (rail) mirrors internal rhythm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths vanish) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via page note ("rhythm breaks") to tapping response narrowing "settling" models. Agency in patterned taps forces trade-off (brief vision, then gone). Cost legible in persistent "drifting moored."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragile rhythms emerges via coral drain, frayed currents, tapping restoration attempt; final sandbar outline reweights premise without moral, embracing loss complexity. Subtext in swallowed stone, water "listen[ing]."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (rhythmic oceanic metaphors: "tide draw slow scars," "distant anchors scraping") modulates with intensity; single POV stable, compression purposeful/legible. Prose rhythm echoes taps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels (short tap beats amid swells); metaphors coherent/patterned (rhythm motifs taught early). No loops/artifacts; final "horizon bent" image clear/propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tapping as sonar-heartbeat revives ocean-memory paths in post-ban world, transforming eco-loss tropes via rhythmic causality. Risky lyric build inevitable in hindsight; no derivatives.</comment>
