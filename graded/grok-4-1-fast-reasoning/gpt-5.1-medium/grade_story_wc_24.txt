<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between duty and secret quest, embodied in dreams of "seconds with razor edges"; final renunciation earned via escalating hesitation, though epiphany edges toward abstraction without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in "set the key on the parapet, turned away"; cost legible in "questions... would evaporate like mist," reweighting illusions with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Station's "walls furred with salt" and roof protractor constrain gaze and realization; horizon's "soft-failed place" charges final image, filtering through POV's professional doubt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (clocks' true measure) signaled early, deepens via counting reversal narrowing to refusal; agency in key's placement forecloses illusion-path with felt evaporation cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of attention's surrender emerges via dripping clocks vs. "unwinding sea"; final image non-literally reweights premise without moralizing, resonant through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in "water thinking about falling"; rhythmic modulation under stress via compressed counting syntax heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; minor figurative density ("razor edges" echoes purposeful) in peak vision but no muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock-tending as illusion-flock transforms time tropes; risk in lyric CR ("offering a question to... gears beyond the clouds") heightens stakes organically.</comment>
