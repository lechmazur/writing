<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's embodied contradiction—vow-bound curiosity loosening via bolt and bruise-touch—forces micro-choice to lead downstairs, earning vocal rebellion; woman's pressure reveals hierarchy of safety vs. truth with closure cost in shattered bones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bolt pings inciting descent and memory-fall revelation under accumulative lens; "Enough" delivers CR, reweighting silence-as-safety with undeniable destruction cost in cracks racing upward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Staircase bruise constrains forbidden descent and triggers fall-memory, charging decision; snow's choral roar evolves setting to mirror internal release in closure cracks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rewired bellhops as furniture and bolt-engraved spiral synthesize silence-trope into inevitable destruction-cure; bold mind/body split risks surreal logic payoff.</comment>
