<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like thumbing the patch during survey, reveal character-specific competence balanced with struggle; motivation to cultivate foresight drives actions consistently. Final insight earned via prior observations without unearned epiphany. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in pivotal survey beats prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from breath tests to emerging patterns, culminating in Conceptual Repricing closure where "foresight could be trained... in the quiet after impact" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of past failures. Orientation anchored early at port gate; single scene coherent. Persistent wind constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Towering container labyrinth and wind vortices constrain survey paths and charge final image of "quiet after impact"; sensory details (vapor strings, gust tugs) filtered through professional bias, vivid and purposeful. No white-room; spatial choreography tracks ascent path cleanly. Recurrent silence subtly mirrors internal focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate foresight via wind survey) signaled early, deepens accumulatively as "patterns emerged with hazy precision," narrowing options to redesign recommendation with felt cost in engineer's fate. Agency in meticulous documentation forecloses ignorance path. One tightening sufficient; cost legible in "all the almosts lining up."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of singular convergence emerges organically from vectors and wind as "living participant," resonant non-literal answer in final "one meticulous breath at a time" reweighting foresight without moralizing. Patch recurs to charge cost subtly. Complexity embraced in ambiguity of near-misses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("read silence the way a pilot reads instruments") biases noticing toward wind/shear; rhythmic control modulates with intensity, prose as character in narrowing handwriting. Stable single POV, no leakage. Experimental compression of observations taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (advance observation + atmosphere), varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; metaphors like "frozen waves" coherent and sparse. Zero figurative muddle in peak insight beat. Opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone crash investigation treating wind as capricious actor, transformed via "singular convergence" angle; patch as frayed warning inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk in accumulative lyric survey heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
