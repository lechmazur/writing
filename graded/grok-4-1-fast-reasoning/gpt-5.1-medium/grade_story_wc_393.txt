<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in Elias's hesitation ("forgiveness was not really mine... But my silence answered him anyway"), embodied in the unwrapping and watching Mara's hands; final stance earned by causal dialogue buildup with visible relational cost. Voices distinct: Mara's deliberate vs. Elias's confessional flow. No slips touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ticking, heart exam, and dialogue reconfigures Elias's doubt into Charged Poise closure ("Take it back to him... stand beside when the doors open"), with cost legible in steadier heart rhythm mirroring his resolved action. Single scene causality tight; orientation anchored by entry and badge in first graph. No ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shop's ticking chorus and rain-veiled window constrain choices via Mara's expertise and mirror hesitation; light on brass charges final image ("burnishing the brass... late autumn leaves"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (gears whisper confessions). Environment evolves with lamp angle, mirroring internal repair.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Elias's parole guidance) signaled early, deepens via Mara's analysis ("damage... not design"), forcing trade-off in his self-doubt; lens escalation via textural density reweights with cost in crystallized advice. Agency in pressing heart forward; no reversals needed, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of remorse-as-repair emerges implicitly via heart's marks ("remorse is not the same as repair"), final image reconfigures without moral ("heart began to beat... undeniably alive") answering "deserve a future" non-literally. Subtext in silences and gestures; complexity lingers in ambiguity of forgiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close Elias with perceptual bias (ticking as confessions); dialogue subtextual ("second opinion from me, or machinery?"), goal-driven, distinct rhythms (Mara's measured vs. Elias's fluid). Rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring ticks ("layered rhythms... contradictory time"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—poetic devices coherent and pattern-taught early (whispers, veils). Closure image vivid, unblurred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chaplain's moral calculus with clockwork metaphor transforms redemption trope; risk in quiet shop confessional heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight: heart's bent tooth parallels Jonah's panic, no derivative echoes.</comment>
