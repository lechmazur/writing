<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines through concrete micro-choices like the perimeter sweep before opening the tube, revealing meticulous traits under pressure; final alignment earns change via prior caution vs. curiosity tension. Contradictory impulses act in scene without summary. Flawless embodiment avoids clichés.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from prickle to pigeons to realization, with Charged Poise closure ("alone but aligned") reconfiguring solitude into purpose; cost legible in foreclosed erasure via commitment. Orientation anchors early; one tightening suffices. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Courtyard fountain and dusk constrain sweeps and listening, charging final readiness image; sensory hierarchy (wind sifting sounds) reflects storm-recorder bias. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism. Micro-setting as pivotal tool elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (observation vs. erasure) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via tube/message/pigeons to stance crystallization; agency in sweep/listen/intuit forecloses passive solitude with felt alignment cost. One deepening reweights options legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storms motif emerges organically, shifting from weather to surveillance "storms" in pigeon realization, resonating in final "layered tranquility" without statement; reweights premise via particulars. Ambiguity invites reflection on integrity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (storm analogies, meticulous mapping) biases noticing distinctively; rhythmic control modulates from tension ("prickle") to poise. Stable first-person, no elision issues; prose as character under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel without loops; metaphors cohere around storms without muddle. Minor overwriting in reflective blocks ("solitude sharpened") slightly slows one beat but anchors present choices per BRR. Closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pigeon-vs-drone mapping in rogue zone transforms quarantine trope via lived observation; fresh synthesis of storms/secrets feels inevitable. Risky lyric build heightens stakes organically.</comment>
