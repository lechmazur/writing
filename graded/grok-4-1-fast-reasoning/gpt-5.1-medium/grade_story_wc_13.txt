<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in "to draw the birthplace of echoes would be to choose which ones survived," earning the renunciation with embodied cost in releasing the pendant; illustrator's sketching habit reveals values under pressure without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pendant's escalating hum building to CR closure in sketching absence ("the moment where choice could not yet hear itself"), with legible cost in foreclosed power; orientation anchors crisply by para 2, no drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rooftop canals and pendant constrain choices (keeper stops at narrowing, time borrowed via water-touch); final image charges with canals "roar[ing] suddenly back," mirroring internal release; sensory hierarchy (taste of bells, slowed droplets) POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find echoes' birthplace) tightens accumulatively via pendant's knot forcing echo visions, agency in twisting/releasing with cost ("forcing possibilities into single lines" renounced); giant's nap live-clocks pressure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of creation's ethics emerges organically from echo-tugging and "edits" realization, reweighted non-literally in absence-sketch; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in "free to find their own beginnings" with conceptual cost of unchecked power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (sketching outlines futures) biases details character-specifically; dialogue subtextual ("You really mean to uncage it" pressures lie); rhythm modulates with stress, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "Sound peeled away... unborn voices" multifunctions); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (time as "clay"/"narrow channels"); peak beats clear, no overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-sculpting pendant in giant-slept city transforms tropes (echoes as shimmers choosing masks); risk in lyric time-borrowing heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via illustrator's arc.</comment>
