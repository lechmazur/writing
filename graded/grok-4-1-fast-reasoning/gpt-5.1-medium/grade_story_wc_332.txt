<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied hollowness after each sunrise compelling higher-stakes suspicion about the vanished librarian; final cliff ascent earns closure via prior causality tying her dream to the archive. Contradictory impulses (hunt others' losses while hollowed) act in scene without alternation. No stock phrasing; flaws like unremembered dream drive inevitable struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of jars, palette, whispers builds to Charged Poise closure where sunrise "poured through her and the camera, fixing every jar," reconfiguring fading with conceptual cost of her hollowness made legible. Orientation anchored early in arrival; one tightening via suspicion linking librarians patterns to cliff payoff. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Palette shards and jars constrain choices (inhaling light at sea edge) and charge final cliff image; sensory hierarchy (mist erasing arrival, wind syllables) reflects Irena's priorities. Micro-setting of camera/palette evolves causally, mirroring internal dissolution. Purposeful selection avoids tourism; spatial coherence in pier-to-cliff progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vitalize/capture dream) signaled early, tightens via villagers' requests and her suspicion narrowing to cliff; hollowness as felt cost forecloses easy solidification after each sunrise. Agency in repeated dawn rituals culminates in highest cliff stance crystallization under Accumulative lens. Minor abstractness in island-fading stakes slightly mutes visceral charge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of longing's cipher emerges organically from jars' symbols and her luminous absence, reweighted in final "indelible, tender clarity" without moralizing. Subtext in offerings (cracked mirror) invites ambiguity on capture's cost. Resonance from particulars like palette stains avoids platitudes; internal arc inextricable from fading/vitalizing question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (catalogs of tides/regrets, breathing syllables); rhythmic modulation builds lyric density taught early. No head-hopping or filter excess; compression purposeful in cipher curls. Voice reflects Irena's librarian mind without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm in read-aloud (short cliff sentences vs. flowing arrivals). Purposeful metaphors (rocks as gills) pattern-taught without muddle; minor figurative density in openings (-0.3) but no loops or scaffolds touching closure. Concrete images replace generics throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-jars, inhaling camera, shard palette transforms trope of vanishing into "paints with light" ingenuity; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes to cliff poise. No derivatives; premise commits to archipelago rules without retreat. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from early whispers.</comment>
