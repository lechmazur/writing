<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Corin's shift from targeting lenses to vessels for inquiry shows contradictory impulses acting in scene via hands-on crafting and narration; narrator's final heart shift is earned by escalating engagement. Voice distinction shines in Corin's theatrical dialogue vs. narrator's cautious questions. No diagnostic labels; flaws like past precision complicate present choices with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setting observation to Corin's backstory reveal, culminating in Charged Poise/CR where narrator's "cautious heart shift, slightly, within its ribs" reconfigures control-to-invitation with emotional cost. Single scene oriented by ~50 words. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Icicles on levers and thawing water constrain choices (work here for thawing uncertainty) and charge final slick corridor exit. Sensory hierarchy via POV: kiln's glow amid frost mirrors internal thaw. Recurring ice evolution integrates tactilely, mirroring stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming control rooms for inquiry) deepens accumulatively via Corin's past-to-present reveal, narrowing options to invitation; narrator's agency in tracing consoles and final stance crystallization forecloses doubt with felt heart-shift cost. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reshaping containment into invitation emerges organically from glassblowing mundane acts; final "stepping into a question that warms itself" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting prior control motif without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (icicles as "undecided sentences"); dialogue goal-driven with subtext (Corin's "bring someone who thinks they are uninteresting"). Rhythmic control modulates from light observation to weighty close; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors coherent (thawing ice to heart/glass), no loops or scaffolds; varied syntax accelerates in kiln pour. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene, zero figurative muddle in peak craft reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of abandoned tech as inquiry space via glassblower's mundane narration transforms trope; risk in poetic lyric mode heightens thawing stakes, inevitable in hindsight via bookmark-to-vessel pivot.</comment>
