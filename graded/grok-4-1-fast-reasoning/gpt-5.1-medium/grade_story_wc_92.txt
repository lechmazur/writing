<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Iri's inventive calm embodies in gaze appraising the fort as broken engine and culminates in rod-slotting choice, earned by stored murmurs and sundial invitation; contradictory obedience vs. revolution acts simultaneously in Trann exchange.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds via density of rumors, sundial code, and rod bridging to RR closure where locks forget inside/outside, with conceptual cost of breached security legible in sighing chains.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bottled daylight dimming to smoky bruise and gear hum constrain tower isolation and enable hidden action; desk sockets as micro-setting directly charge final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature of mechanical appraisal ("calmly inventive mechanic") biases noticing toward gears and circuits; Trann dialogue subtextual in hesitant pupils and forgotten presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density in multi-tasking lines like "teeth slipped, weights shifted, and chains sighed" propels without loops; rhythm varies from observational breath to thickened-dark acceleration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sundial angles and quill-rod key synthesize fresh steampunk lock-revolution, transforming tropes via shadow letters and forgotten orientations with hindsight inevitability.</comment>
