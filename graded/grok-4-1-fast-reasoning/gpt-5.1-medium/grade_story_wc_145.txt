<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's dry wit and map-editor precision shine in embodied details like the "subtly confident twitch" before redrawing coastlines, with contradictory impulses (official atlas vs. insistent reality) driving the final sketching choice. Interiority particular and concrete, avoiding epiphanies. Final revision earns change via prior patterns, confronting flaws with cost. Minor flaw: one reflective summary slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns (falcon, sketch, condensation, trickle) densify toward CR closure in the kneeling sketch and falcon's heralding call, reweighting map premise with "quiet trouble" cost legible in final lines. Orientation anchors early (dock, lake, outpost). Single scene coherent, one tightening at seam discovery. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen lake and outpost constrain choices (ice holds weight, seam emerges), with condensation pattern charging final bluff image. Sensory details selective via POV (creaks as accusations, ice groans). Micro-setting (red pencil, cylinder) lived-in and purposeful. Evolving environment mirrors internals without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (true river origins vs. official maps) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pattern convergence narrowing to seam, forcing stance crystallization in revision sketch. Agency in crossing ice and kneeling, with felt cost of "quiet trouble." One deepening suffices; minor abstractness in stakes legibility holds back 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Singular convergence theme emerges organically from particulars (languages, flows, maps), reweighting premise in final murmuring realization and sketch without moralizing. Subtext in heralding images; ambiguity lingers in trouble's herald. Final image answers "where rivers begin" resonantly. No thematic echo or binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in map metaphors ("spread like fallen feathers," "sketching their own map"); rhythmic control modulates tension, compression under stress. Single POV stable, no head-hopping. Voice biased toward cartographic precision. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, propulsion in varying rhythms ("wings cut the air without a sound"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Sensory integration advances beats; final line recharges motifs. Minor register elevation in one reflection unpenalized as voice-fit.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh magical realist synthesis of cartography and hydrology via pattern convergence feels inevitable; falcon and condensation transform tropes organically. Risky quiet CR heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; particulars irreplaceable.</comment>
