<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied, with envy for the linden tree's spiral tugging against her control fetish; contradictory impulses shine in detours to the trellis despite self-denial. Final surrender earned via accumulated plant observations, but minor therapy-speak in "reluctant metamorphosis" edges from full 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of plant images builds to CR closure in the "dense, green hush" with iron-taste fear as felt cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene with ellipses tightens meaningfully at leaf-heat trigger.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mossy trellis and linden leaf constrain choices, charging final kneel; sensory hierarchy (sap whispers, jeweled drops) filters via nursery owner's bias. Weather evolves causally, mirroring internal storm without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resist vs. surrender) signaled early via rows "learning new shapes"; textural deepening at visions forecloses control path with agency in pocket-touch. Escalation coherent under lens, cost legible in chest-spiral echo, but lacks micro-turn reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unscheduled growth emerges organically from linden wound and seedling rows; final image reconfigures control premise via plant-surrender parallel, resonant without moral. Ambiguity lingers in "without her consent" fear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in root-waking smells and leaf skins; rhythmic modulation peaks in terse "Her knees gave" under stress. No head-hopping or withholding; diction plant-idiosyncratic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; "circuitously sincere" twice taught as voice-tic without loop. Minor figurative density in peak visions risks muddle, but coherence holds to charged closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh plant-human metamorphosis synthesis via wounded linden spiral; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in CR without gimmick. Transformation test passes: swap nursery for generic yields no equivalent resonance.</comment>
