<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in brother's death compels the pivotal book-opening choice with embodied tears as cost; contradictory impulses (bristle then sag) act in scene. Mara applies targeted pressure without diluting focus. Minor diagnostic echo in "failure to stay" slightly abstracts interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to book dissolve, lands CR closure in voicemail realization reconfiguring refusal's contour with emotional cost legible in "hollow he had filled... with imagined recriminations." Orientation anchored early; single scene with purposeful flashback shard tightens to one unit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Secret library's curved shelves and humming books constrain reading choice and charge final image of invitation; sensory selection (rustle, fog-like air) mirrors internal states through POV bias. Micro-setting (gray volume) evolves causally to payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unearth wisdom from mistake) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Mara's confrontation and book to agency in opening it; cost unmistakable in tears/release foreclosing exile. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of regret-as-path emerges organically from particulars (regret-sorted books, brother's volume); final image non-literally answers refusal's weight via "space for a different future," reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (empathetic gaze filtering stacks); dialogue subtextual (Mara echoes thoughts, prompting micro-choice). Rhythm modulates intensity; minor filter in "seemed to gather" voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to closure; figurative language purposeful ("shelves... like disputing siblings") without muddle. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors risks density dip but integrates; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh premise transforms hidden library trope into regret-orbiting paradox system; synthesis of reclusiveness and magical realism inevitable in hindsight via book dissolve turn growing from particulars.</comment>
