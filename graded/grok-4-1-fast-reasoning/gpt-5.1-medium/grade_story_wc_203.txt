<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority shines in embodied curiosity ("weightless burden") and contradictory impulses against instincts when touching the barrel; boy's ghost adds relational pressure without diluting single-POV focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise/CR closure in inverted room reveal ("Something moved...chosen a direction"); orientation anchors early, cost legible in breached "agreements" against instincts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ceiling bulge and inverted room constrain observation/choice and charge final image; sensory details (cold breath, fibrous sigh) filter through mechanic's bias, evolving causally without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (probe ceilings) signaled early tightens accumulatively via dust analysis to barrel touch narrowing options; protagonist agency forecloses safe inaction with felt instinctual cost at breach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ceilings-as-breached-agreements theme emerges organically from particulars (bulge pulses, inverted room); final pacing machinery reweights facade motif with conceptual cost, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (reads dust/residue like film, buildings "learned to lie") biases details; stable first-person distance modulates rhythmically without leakage, elision purposeful for ghosts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure, metaphors purposeful ("entrails" for hum dying); minor figurative density in build-up slightly risks overwrite but integrates without muddling breach.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ghost-seeing elevator tech probing inverted ceiling rooms transforms tropes via mechanic's lens (dust patterns, mainspring); risk-taking in reality-as-fracture feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
