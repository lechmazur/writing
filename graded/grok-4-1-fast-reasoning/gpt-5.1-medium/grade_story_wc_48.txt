<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the novelist's lie felt as "chill along his ribs" and refusal to name the ending, earning the final realization of cowardice through visions; micro-choices like pressing the seashell reveal values under pressure. Minor diagnostic edge in "clarity of his own cowardice" borders epiphany but embodies via nausea/awe.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from vanishing ink to river visions tightening stake, landing Conceptual Repricing in "an ending was not a verdict but a shoreline" with legible cost of unflinching self-recognition; orientation anchors early in streets/riverfront, seashell constraint shapes tactics to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>River as environment constrains via backward reflections charging visions and final shoreline image; micro-setting seashell enables pivotal ear-pressing choice; sensory selection (rain braided mist, swirling hush) purposeful, filtered through lucid POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (embrace hope's continuity vs. ambiguity) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via narrator's accusations and visions' deepening that crystallize stance; cost unmistakable in foreclosed ellipses/path of cowardice, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of accountable hope emerges organically from cut hopes in visions and shoreline reconfiguration, offering non-literal resonance without moralizing; final image reweights prior refusals via particulars like child's spaceship, ex-lover's knock.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in "margins and silences as physical walls"; narrator dialogue subtextual ("You keep tearing them out"), goal-driven; rhythmic control modulates hush to humming shell under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "reflections that flowed opposite its current" advances plot/atmosphere/theme); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops/artifacts; figurative coherence in mist/punctuation figure purposeful, not muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Surreal narrator/seashell as aperture transforms writer-block trope into fresh conceptual frame; risk of ethereal confrontation heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via ink tug to shoreline payoff.</comment>
