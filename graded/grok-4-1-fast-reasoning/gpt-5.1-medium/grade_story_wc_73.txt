<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grim optimist's contradictory impulses shine in dice rolls amid endless climb and notebook proofs; final endurance of present texture earned by prior asymmetries pauses, with embodied scuffing as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup (pauses, dice, scribbles) to rupture pattern break; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in "texture...scuffing beneath his boots," with certainty cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Infinite staircase constrains climb choices; pivotal crack vision and warm railing asymmetries charge rupture climax, mirroring internal regret without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of missed opportunity) signaled early, tightens texturally via rupture vision glimpse forcing present-endurance crystallization; cost unmistakable in foreclosed "doors he would never open."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of process-over-outcome emerges organically from dice chip and proofs; final image resonant non-literal answer reweighting missed paths into "small, stubborn circles of meaning."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (mathematical optimism on infinity) with rhythmic modulation peaks at shudder paragraph; purposeful lyric compression legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied rhythm (short shudder lines accelerate); zero loops or artifacts, metaphors coherent ("contract signed in fog") charging closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Surreal staircase-math synthesis transforms regret trope into fresh perpetual motion frame; cross-stair vision risk heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight without gimmick.</comment>
