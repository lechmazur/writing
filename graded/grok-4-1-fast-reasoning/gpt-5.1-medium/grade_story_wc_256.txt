<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elya's contradictory impulses peak when questioning if bells are a "mirror" rather than path, earning the shared pilgrimage choice with embodied cost ("loosened something in her chest"). Visitor applies immediate relational pressure without voice convergence. Minor reflective summary early, but closure choice compellingly motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as tonal density builds from solo hush to shared "lattice of tones," yielding Charged Poise closure in "two questions listening... texture of connection" with legible cost of foreclosed solo certainty. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bells and miner's lens constrain ringing choices via "colors bending through the lens," charging final shared image; lab shelves integrate tactilely ("soaking into floorboards"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (tin taste, skin brush). No white-room; evolves with generators coughing outside.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Doubt in pilgrimage deepens via visitor's arrival, forcing Elya's "no map" question and score abandonment, narrowing to shared propulsion under textural lens. Agency in micro-choice to "follow colors"; cost felt in voiced uncertainty charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bells-as-mirror motif emerges organically, reweighting leadership to mutuality in final "woven hush" image without moralizing; subtext in visitor's "honest" need layers connection's texture. Complexity lingers in naive hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("hush richer than silence," "taste of tin and river fog") biases toward sonic textures; dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("Will you walk if no map?"). Stable close-third; rhythm modulates pressure seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("struck... kiss of motion so small it barely moved the air"); metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (light "shivered like water"). Varied syntax flows read-aloud; no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bells "tuned to memories" premise transforms pilgrimage trope into sonic pilgrimage; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via textured connection payoff.</comment>
