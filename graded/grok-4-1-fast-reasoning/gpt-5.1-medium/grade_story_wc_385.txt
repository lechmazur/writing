<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied grief ("Grief sharpened within her, clean as the night air") and micro-choices under pressure (pressing shell, speaking to stone); contradictory impulses of blame and patience culminate in earned acceptance. Final renunciation of judgment feels compelled by prior causality. No unearned epiphanies or label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: progressive echoes (obvious, errors, second line) deepen knowledge toward CR closure where canyon "keeps what remained," reweighting premise with emotional cost legible in loosened knot. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Canyon and shell constrain choices (shell to ground elicits response) and charge final image (shell to ear yields surf); sensory hierarchy (voice on stone, grit wind) reflects perceptual bias. Details tactile and evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (echo truth) signaled early, escalates via deepening echoes that narrow options from judgment to witness; agency in flute/speech forces realization with legible cost in grief's sharpening/loosening. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of fragile voices as unchosen debts emerges organically from chorus revelation, resonant CR in steadier song reweights grief without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "almost" voices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("listen like stone listens"); rhythmic prose modulates melancholy to acceptance, diction biased (reed-blown, fractures). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; metaphors coherent ("canyon became a throat") enhance without muddle. Minor figurative density in peak chorus beat but purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo quest and canyon as impartial keeper transforms grief trope; risk in lyric progression feels inevitable, heightened by shell's reprise.</comment>
