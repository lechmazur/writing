<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Milo's traits—sound-identification, calculated preparation via oiling vents weeks prior—drive micro-choices like targeted whispers, earning the closure proof against Ramos. Contradictory impulses in "pretending spontaneity while thoughts stacked surgically" act in scene. Final coin-flip smile reveals hierarchy of values with social cost to reputation if failed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: prepped vents + key + maps enable whisper guidance, yielding inspectors' emergence and Ramos's changed walk as DC/Charged Poise. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in shutdown threat and "if your whisper game fails, we close."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Labyrinth constrains via mismatched maps/vibrations guiding whispers; grated vents as micro-setting enable tactics. Storm's "air more awake" and diesel drafts sharpen sensory hierarchy, charging final "emerge from metal thicket exactly on time."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue or shutdown) tightens via Milo's agency in whisper relays, foreclosing yell-failure option. Causal escalation narrows paths; cost visible in timed emergence and Ramos's initial snort of doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of listening vs. shouting emerges via failed yells/successful whispers, answered non-literally in Ramos's "slower, thoughtful walk" reweighting premise. No moralizing; irony in inspectors' "directions from walls" charges closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in walk-IDs and maze "moods"; voice modulates rhythmically under storm pressure. Dialogue subtextual (Ramos's "pointless challenge"); no head-hopping, diction POV-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "whispers threaded routes prepared with oil and mapfold" multi-tasks image/cause/advancement. No loops/artifacts; rhythm varies, metaphors consistent (steel canyons, fault lines).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of sound-maze, vent-whispers, relic-key transforms labyrinth trope; risk in storm-fried tech heightens stakes. Final walk-repricing feels inevitable from sound-ID setup.</comment>
