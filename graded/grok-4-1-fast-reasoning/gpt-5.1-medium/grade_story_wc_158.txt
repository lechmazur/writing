<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (insomnia's ache vs. vow to photosynthesize pain) act in scene through gathering tools and singing despite imperfection; final sleep earned by causal chain of negotiation. Interiority particular via poet's perceptual bias (e.g., "barnacles pulsing like metronomes"). No unearned epiphanies; flaws like insomnia complicate until closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from missing moon to song-induced coral path to moon's return as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost in vulnerable song ("notes...off-key wind"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening via polyps blooming narrows to curtain. Cost legible in "silver bled through, hesitant at first."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shell's spiral corridors and reef constrain movement to outermost chamber, charging final image (barnacles to coins under moon). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (poet notices "water-light...reef-shadow joy"); details evolve causally (coral blooms). Micro-setting (postcard as tool) shapes negotiation choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore moon via art) signaled early; agency in humming/singing deepens pressure under Accumulative lens via coral reversal, foreclosing hiding with trade-off (forgive "bright cruelty" for phases). Cost felt in rising voice and imagined seeds drifting. Climax coral path tests commitment without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (beauty/sorrow coexistence) emerges from legend-to-action arc, resonant non-literal answer in "blossom armistice" final image reweighting pain into "patient verse" without moralizing. Recurring "reef-shadow joy" shifts from hurt to cradle. Complexity via moon's "sulking" phases accepted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (poetic bias: pain as "heavy blue bruise"); voice modulates rhythmically (short urgent lines in song to flowing closure). Lyrical compression taught early, legible at moon's slip from hiding. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., song beat layers image/action); rhythm varies (fragmented "Petal after petal" accelerates). Heavy figurative language coherent in lyric mode, taught by poet's notebook/humming, no muddle at closure. Minor paraphrase loop in "shyly unstoppable" repetition (-0.3), but purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: underwater poet negotiates moon's return via grandmother's postcard and coral truce transforms insomnia trope. "Blossom armistice" legend organically drives turns; risk in lyric summoning heightens stakes without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from vow-to-treaty arc.</comment>
