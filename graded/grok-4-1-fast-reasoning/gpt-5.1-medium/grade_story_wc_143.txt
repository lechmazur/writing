<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied, with contradictory impulses (save grain vs accept necessity) acting in real-time choices like kneeling print beside history's and rejecting stability lie. Final endurance earned by prior curiosity trait and daughter stake, foreclosing sabotage with felt career/family cost. Daughter's question line crystallizes power flaw without label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflections and images tightens to Charged Poise closure in amber pour as hush breaks, reweighting preservation stake with conceptual cost of era's end. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one deepening via T-20 ping narrows reprieve option. Cost legible in "red vial stayed cold" implying unignited death signal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (regolith vibration, low-gravity dust refusal) filtered through inspector's priorities constrain choices like anchoring tripod at rim. Recurring summit basalt shard as micro-setting enables vial reaction, charging final image. POV bias shapes hierarchy: notices beacon pulse over distant sunrise seam.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (document before erasure) signaled early, textural escalation via mounting density and ping forces endurance crystallization without reversal. Agency in micro-choices like glove print and amber pour forecloses lie path with visible cost (hush narrows to breath). Price legible in harvesters' glimmering submersion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transience vs beauty emerges organically from grain vigil and vial messages, with final amber bloom offering resonant non-literal answer to preservation question. Subtext in silences (unused red vial) and images (Earthshine seam) invites ambiguity without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from hush's inexorable break.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature: lunar frequencies "too slow to hear" bias noticing. Rhythmic control modulates from patient melancholy to charged peak, prose as character in syntax reflecting deliberate curiosity. No elision or head-hopping; compression purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "set his pack down and checked the vials" advances action/atmosphere/stake); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language coherent and sparse in peak (hush "narrowing to a final breath"), zero artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lunar heritage erasure via timed chemical messages transforms space-age trope into personal endurance tale. Risky quiet Charged Poise ending heightens stakes through irreplaceable grain/hourglass motif constraining final poise. No derivative echoes; voice commits fully to dawnlit premise.</comment>
