<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the skeptic's resolve to treat the pilgrimage as "a question mark rather than a scripture," earning the final endurance in the clearing with embodied doubt via the dull amber.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from tower descent through footprint multiplication to spiral clearing; Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost in "waited to see whether the chemistry of homecoming would begin with thunder or with more bronze quiet."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rainwashed tower, overgrown path, and bare clearing constrain the descent and charge the final palm-like image; fly amber as micro-setting recurs to test "thickest" history, mirroring internal doubt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of skeptical homecoming deepens via footprint equations revealing "chain" reaction; one tightening at halfway doubling narrows to convergence, with agency in following and waiting under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of homecoming as unresolved chain emerges via fly's "fossilized pause" shifting to world's "clinging to the comfort of almost"; final image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mathematical metaphors like "tremor of meaning under every variable" and "equation of absence"; rhythmic control modulates from rebellious interiority to poised quiet.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figures like "moss clung in runnels like old handwriting"; no loops, propulsion peaks in convergence without overwriting in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-contact pilgrimage with amber fly as trapped traveler; risk in lyric accumulative frame transforms sci-fi tropes into inevitable skeptic's poise.</comment>
