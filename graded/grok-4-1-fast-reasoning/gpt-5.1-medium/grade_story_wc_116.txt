<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Concrete micro-choices like reading the swan by touch reveal character-particular interiority and grip on reality; motivation to witness without judgment drives the pivotal step onto the blank page with earned internal conflict, though emotions lean atmospheric over sharply embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from swan summons to page-path futures blooming; closure as Charged Poise at river's edge reconfigures neutrality premise with legible cost ("abandon his vantage"), orientation anchored early in library awakening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recurring page-path and river of mirrored stone constrain choices and charge final image; sensory details like "ink seeped from his footprints" selectively mirror internal shift through POV-biased perception, vivid yet purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of neutrality vs. immersion tightens accumulatively when footprints draft futures, narrowing options with felt cost in foreclosed detachment; pressure coheres to stance crystallization at river without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of entering fractures to witness emerges organically from particulars like surfacing roots; final image of flickering cities offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting observation into participation, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct lyrical texture ("grips reality loosely" perceptual signature); rhythmic modulation heightens transformation beats, purposeful compression taught early via swan folds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively; figurative density overwrites slightly in warping shelves beat, but no loops or scaffolds obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of buried library surfacing via keeper's loose grip transforms chronicle trope organically; risk-taking in textural origami summons heightens stakes inevitably toward CR closure.</comment>
