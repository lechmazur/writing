<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied tugs and whispers; contradictory weaving vs. puzzle impulses act in the unwinding beat, earning the sacrifice with prior causality and cost. Minor poetic abstraction in emotion doesn't flatten pressure. Final choice reveals values hierarchy without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from puzzle edges to tapestry sacrifice, landing Charged Poise closure ("warm breath exhaled, and distant footsteps turned") with legible cost (bare loom). Orientation anchored early; one tightening realizes equal-weight exchange. Pattern taught without disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard/bamboo micro-setting constrains solitude for listening threads and hushes at climax, charging final image as "abruptly older." Sensory selection (frosted apples, lantern-wavering snow) POV-biased and purposeful. Bamboo-apple graft mirrors hybrid worlds organically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (message to Haru) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via puzzle deepening to sacrifice narrowing options. Agency in unwinding forecloses tapestry path with on-page cost; pressure coheres without coincidence resolution. Trade-off legibility enters 8.8+ via loom's bareness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fragile connection emerges implicitly from thread/puzzle motifs shifting to reconnection cost; final image reweights weaving's futility non-literally. Subtext in silences and sacrifices avoids moralizing, inviting ambiguity on reunion's price. Resonance from particulars like silver river threads.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, with perceptual signature of weaving metaphors ("shuttle flew," "yarn pulled") modulating rhythm under stress. Purposeful compression legible from opening hush. No head-hopping; diction biases toward tactile echoes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "puzzle grew from scattered teeth into a jagged window"); varied rhythm flows read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (raveling, threading); propulsion peaks cleanly at unwinding without overwriting in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Puzzle-as-sideways-loom premise synthesizes loss, crafting, and portals freshly; risk in magical accrual heightens stakes via sacrifice rule. Turns inevitable from bead/puzzle seeds; no template echoes, transforms folklore via cardboard specificity.</comment>
