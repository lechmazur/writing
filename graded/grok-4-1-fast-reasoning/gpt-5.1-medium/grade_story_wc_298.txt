<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's guilt over brother's scarf is embodied and drives hand-on-cloth micro-choice; Lio's reckless idealism shown via satchel care vs. punching, culminating in earned steadiness with Lio's dimming cost. Minor slip in epiphany phrasing ("become someone who would have stayed") borders therapy-speak but ties to prior memory without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from entry to ritual invocation ("roots beneath the altar shivered"); closure as RR via light flare and sift-through with legible cost (Lio older, narrator steadier) on final lines. Orientation anchored in opening ("followed Lio into the catacomb orchard"); one tightening via blood drop suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard's roots/bones constrain ritual (channels lead to "soil, into the tangle"); sensory hierarchy (rust/pomegranates, wax hiccup) mirrors internal dusk. Altar as "mouth" charges final image, evolving causally with shiver/creak.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend soul via barter) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to blood/invocation narrowing options; agency in placing hand/memory forecloses old self with Lio's dimming as felt cost. Climax pressure coherent under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Compassion's cost emerges organically from ritual (Lio "dimmer around the edges"); final image reconfigures witnessing theme without moralizing. Subtext in Fool card ("beginning that refuses to calculate") resonates via sift-through realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (moth-eaten soul, scarf accusation) biases details; dialogue sparse/natural ("Not a fool..."), goal-driven. Rhythmic control modulates to peak ("air stretch, a thin tightening") without drift.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "roots snaked between bones, trammeling skulls"); varied rhythm, no loops. Dense figuratives purposeful in lyric buildup, coherent without muddle at closure flare.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard/altar-mouth premise synthesizes fresh ritual economy; transforms barter trope via Lio's offering-role payoff. Risky dusky lyricism heightens stakes organically.</comment>
