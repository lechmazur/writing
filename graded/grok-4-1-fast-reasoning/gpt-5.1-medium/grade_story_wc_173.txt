<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Iri's motivation to defy conformity roots in chaste refusal, shown through concrete micro-choices like weaving echoes into constellations instead of jars. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the harvest beat, with her body marked by grief as visible cost. Final smile earns chastity as "fierce, untouched choice," foreclosing compliance path with treason's felt price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of unlocked echoes builds to exhale's Charged Poise, reconfiguring palace conformity with undeniable cost in "rung in their bones like an alarm." Orientation anchors early (Iri, courtyard, midnight by para 2). Single scene from descent to sanctuary coheres, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sanctuary's light-threads constrain Iri's hands/actions, charging final hush-exhale image. Sensory selection (shimmer, trembling strands) filters through her secret-observing bias, evolving with echoes' rattle. "Prism sanctuary under starlight" mirrors defiance, integrating causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy via echo-harvest) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as strands knot her, forcing exhale trade-off. Agency in weaving forecloses king's intent, with cost in courtiers' shiver and soldier's fatigue. One deepening suffices, pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unreadable defiance emerges organically from Iri's weaving and exhale, reweighting conformity's lullaby without statement. Final image ("new kind of listening") offers non-literal answer, charging prior echoes with ambiguity's lingering cost. No moralizing; complexity in gentle alarm endures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: notices averted gazes, inhaling rooms over kisses. Poetic rhythm modulates from descent's poise to peak's hush, consistent diction/texture. No elision or head-hopping; voice as character under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: images like "light folded so many times it had forgotten its color" advance atmosphere/pressure. Minor figurative density in peak weaving ("poems on her skin") borders overwrite but pattern-taught early, no loops/muddle obscuring exhale clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: echoes as polite-death residue harvested via threads transforms courtesan trope into defiance engine. Bold lyric risk (poetic compression) heightens stakes, inevitable exhale grows from prism logic without retreat. No derivative echoes; particularity anchors universals.</comment>
