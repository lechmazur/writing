<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses vividly act in scene ("cautious professor, panicked saboteur, quiet figure who stayed") and final endurance of hope is earned via skepticism test and grief, with embodied cost in micro-choices like nudging orbs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds through gauge tests to Charged Poise closure ("needle centered itself at a modest but undeniable ascent"); cost legible in "flash of grief for... Unlifted futures," shaping final image without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Grotto and decorations (glass orbs, mirrors on hooks) constrain choices and charge closure; bioluminescent algae scatters "shifting graphs," mirroring internal experiments; sensory hierarchy reflects logical dreamer's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (equations for hope) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven tests ("nudged one glass orb... needle rose"); cost unmistakable in needle's sag to "Unlifted" and ensuing grief foreclosing apathy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("modest but undeniable ascent... enough to begin") offers resonant, non-literal answer to hope-vs-collapse question, reweighting experiments without moralizing; emerges organically from particulars like orb arrangements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (vibrations as "Morse-code arguments," probabilities "slipping around my fingers") with rhythmic control under pressure; stable first-person focalization biases toward mathematical lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied syntax ("hush roared," "waves braided the moonlight"); figurative language purposeful and pattern-taught in experimental context, no loops or muddle touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rewired gauge measuring futures in grotto synthesizes proofs/hope ingeniously, with risk-taking in parallel-timeline frame heightening stakes; fresh inflections like "Unlifted" dial transform tropes inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
