<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Singular POV excels with concrete interiority and embodied emotion, as in "feels absence layered within absence" at the column, revealing contradictory impulses (stoic surveyor vs. sensitive archivist); final endurance of hidden archive earned via prior micro-choices like tucking notes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from early anchoring (causeway, harbor by para 1) through density build to CR closure: final "absence, properly mapped, can burn" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of outlasting tide, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (brine tang, grout flow) filter through surveyor's bias, constraining choices (tide presses higher); submerged pavilion as micro-setting charges final image of "structure breathes, holding her hidden sentences like lungs."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wrest from forgetting) signaled early, escalates via textural density of notes-to-repairs under Accumulative lens, with tide as one tightening narrowing time/options; cost felt in "tucking someone into sleep" sealing notes forever.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resistance to oceanic forgetting emerges organically from particulars like missing tiles/voices; resonant CR ending reweights via "patient, hushed blaze" without moralizing, tying to prior absences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (lyric precision on cracks/tides) modulates rhythm under rising pressure; purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punches amid flows) propels without loops or artifacts; metaphors cohere (e.g., "drowned lantern," "lungs full of air") in peak repair beats, passing read-aloud test flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveyor-as-archivist in flooded world transforms loss tropes via notes-in-cracks; risk-taking lyric structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at inkwell-to-conviction arc.</comment>
