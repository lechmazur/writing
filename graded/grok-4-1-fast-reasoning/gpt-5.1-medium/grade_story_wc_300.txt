<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses act vividly in her "feeling ridiculous" throat-clearing before confessing, earning the final change in her "sealed corridors" with embodied ghost-light cost; Rafi applies subtle pressure without stealing focus; voice coherent and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through density build to Charged Poise closure in Mara's provisional "safe" marking and heart-reopening realization, with legible emotional cost in final image; orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystal caves and pearl constrain hesitation/choice and charge final ghost-light image; sensory details (mirrored facets, resonant hush) selectively bias through Mara's inspector lens, evolving with confession; lived-in choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (inspecting hopes vs. tombs) signaled early tightens via confession reversal under accumulative lens, narrowing to vulnerability cost painted on her hands; agency in whisper forecloses cynical path with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hopes vs. dread emerges organically from pearl/shell particulars to resonant final image reopening hearts without moralizing; subtext in shared silence reweights survival premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in "latent radiance" diction; dialogue sparse, natural/subtextual (Rafi's "you can say something"); rhythm modulates to charged hush at peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm mirroring hesitation's elongation; no loops, metaphors coherent/patterned (radiance motif); read-aloud ear perfect, zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bunker trope with pearl-as-crown grown from etched confessions transforms premise organically; risk in lyric hush heightens emotional stakes, inevitable in hindsight via heart-walls motif.</comment>
