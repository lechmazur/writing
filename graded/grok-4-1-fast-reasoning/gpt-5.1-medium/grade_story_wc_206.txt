<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation roots in his peculiar talent for hearing fractures, shown through embodied reactions like veins prickling near the lantern's dishonesty; micro-choices with the music box reveal values under pressure. Mayor applies targeted pressure via the shard. Final endurance of his method earns the city's restoration with felt conceptual cost to the covenant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from workshop to chamber, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) as shard glows and rust flakes, reconfiguring the covenant—"Light seeped along the rust, and where it passed, lies flaked away like scabs from healed skin"—with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Resonance chamber constrains and charges climax, amplifying Elias's hummed song into storms of echo; rust recoils tactilely from his touch. Sensory hierarchy (droplets ring like bells, metal whispers) reflects his repairman's ear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim light from false midnight) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via descent and song against rust; agency in adjusting covenant's wording forecloses dishonest path with pause's held breath as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truthful song mending lies emerges implicitly via rust-as-covenant imagery; final shard's glow offers resonant reconfiguration—"glowing as if remembering how to be a smaller morning"—reweighting bargain without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with Elias's perceptual signature (fingertip listening, silence shaking chest); voice modulates rhythmically with pressure, dialogue subtextual (Mayor's whispers reveal desperation). No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and multi-job lines; purposeful metaphors cohere (rust as "red moss," "scabs from healed skin") without muddle in climax. No loops or scaffolds obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music-box mender vs. rust-bound covenant transforms philosopher's stone trope through song-truth logic; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes organically to inevitable closure.</comment>
