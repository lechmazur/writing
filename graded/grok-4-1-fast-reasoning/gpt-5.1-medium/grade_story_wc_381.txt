<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particularized through "tranquil blaze" and embodied cost ("weight added to his bones") during erasures; contradictory compassion holds steady amid tightening chest, earning closure renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of visions dissolves prophecy threads into hush; Charged Poise closure in "slow, grateful breath" reconfigures threat with legible bone-weight cost at final listen.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Brook and reeds constrain ritual choice ("chose this place...world half remembered silence"); fireflies' final "new patterns" charge closure image, mirroring hush's possible futures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to hush prophecy escalates via unraveling visions under Textural lens, narrowing to erasure trade-off; agency in chant forecloses echo with "weight in bones" cost charging final air-lightness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of compassionate silencing emerges via prophecy holes in memory; final fireflies offer non-literal reweighting of fixed ruin into "futures...only possible," resonating without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable limited third with perceptual signature of silences ("hush thickened," "valleys where sound went to rest"); rhythmic control modulates from cosmic earthiness to peak compression in chant.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but figurative density ("bright threads...snowfall on closed eyes") in peak visions borders overload without obscuring closure; no loops, purposeful hush recurrence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami silence-map hushing coded doom transforms prophecy trope; risk in lyric hush-pattern inevitable at "fireflies drifted in new patterns," heightening stakes organically.</comment>
