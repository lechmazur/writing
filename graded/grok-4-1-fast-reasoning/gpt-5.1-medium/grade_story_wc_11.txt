<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particularized through custodian metaphors like "cool ache under every diagnostic report" and contradictory impulses in loop choices (touch/refuse violin) earn the final perceptual shift with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as loops densify observations ("frost feathers," aerial ghost view) into pattern break (stuttering loops), delivering Conceptual Repricing closure—"thoughts now seemed to come from the space between moments"—with legible conceptual cost in altered pattern tables.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard micro-setting constrains choice via thermal sensors on violin melt and charges final image of "puddled remains" and "frost... on HEPA-3's fingertips," filtered through janitor POV (icicles as "organ pipes").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (origin of thoughts) signaled early, escalates via accumulating loop details and violin tone's aerial view that narrows perception, forcing endurance of repetitions with deepening cost in carried "ghost" overlay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mind escaping patterns emerges organically from loop particulars and violin sound, resonant final image reweighting premise without moralizing—"space between moments" answers curiosity with oblique conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature via janitor idiom ("between broom strokes," "turning a page in a maintenance log") modulates rhythm under loop pressure; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and purposeful figures ("icicles... like organ pipes") propel without loops or scaffolds; closure image crisp and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of janitor robot in mundane time loops with ice violin transforms tropes, risk in "mundane mysticism" heightens stakes via accumulating insight to inevitable CR.</comment>
