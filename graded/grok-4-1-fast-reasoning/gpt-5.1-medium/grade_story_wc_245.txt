<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied through skin absorption and bone vibrations; voices of loss reveal contradictory impulses acting in real-time as chords on nerves. Final renunciation ("stay") earned by inward-pointing ring and accumulated voices, foreclosing external seeking with felt cost of illuminated guilt. No stock phrasing; flaws like silent love and pride complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vibrations, languages, notes density-build to silence where "stay" reconfigures inward mapping. Orientation anchored early (morning stars stilled, enters forest). Closure as RR (Earned Stasis) on-page with cost in kneeling agreement, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest selective and purposeful (humming to bone, notes tapping air), constraining choices via vibrations guiding to hollow. Body/skin as micro-setting charges final soil-touch. Sensory hierarchy blind-specific, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emotional depths/stillpoint) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as trail thickens into voices/heavier ring, narrowing to silence. Agency in following pulses, kneeling; cost legible in foreclosed outward paths and "quiet blaze" illuminating avoided rooms.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of internal mapping emerges organically from voices braiding to "stay," reweighting premise without statement. Final image (new un-wallable map) offers non-literal resonance, charging guilt-forgiveness channels with ambiguity. No moralizing; complexity in refusal's cost lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with tactile/ultrasonic perceptual signature; diction/rhythm modulates from humming density to silence poise. Lyrical compression taught early (compass warms/cools), legible at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short note-pitches to long braiding phrase); metaphors coherent ("quiet blaze" recurs purposefully). Zero loops, scaffolds, or muddle; propulsion peaks in "silence pressed like cool hands," charging closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: blind skin-absorber dowsing loss via ultrasonic notes transforms mapping trope organically. Risky lyric accumulation heightens inward turn without gimmick; inevitable in hindsight from ring's inward ache.</comment>
