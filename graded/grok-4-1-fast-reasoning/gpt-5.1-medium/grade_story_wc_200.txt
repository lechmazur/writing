<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation roots deeply in brother's death and crocodile tooth ritual, compelling coaxing choices with embodied fearlessness; internal conflict emerges in ritual bite before playful address. Final laughter integration earns stasis via prior micro-choices under gorge pressure. No label-speak; flaws like past grief complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: descent accumulates spectral density to RR closure where "laughter...stitched...harmony" reconfigures imbalance with felt conceptual cost in "world tilt, just slightly." Orientation anchors by para 2; single scene spirals coherently without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Gorge and harp constrain descent/path and coaxing tactics; recurring wind/harp mirrors internal shift from discord to harmony, charging final veiled sunrise image. Sensory hierarchy (muted light, scraping melody, wind throat) filters via Mara's priorities, vivid yet selective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (music imbalance hoarding joy) signals early, tightens texturally as confessions layer to laughter narrowing discord options; agency in "nudged...absurd edge" drives escalation with legible cost in shaky harmony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief-fermenting humor emerges organically via confession particulars shifting to "gold mending"; final tilt reweights premise without moral, inviting ambiguity in ongoing healing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with luminous perceptual signature ("shadows seemed to listen harder"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure from "crooked chords" to giggles; minimal speech natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm/syntax; purposeful metaphors ("drunk acrobat," "gold mending") cohere without muddle or loops, even in peak confession beat. No scaffolds; read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-healing via absurd confessions transforms folklore tropes; risk in playful coaxing heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via harp logic.</comment>
