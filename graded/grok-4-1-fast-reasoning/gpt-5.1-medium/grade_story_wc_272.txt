<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and painterly, with contradictory impulses toward light avoidance and shadow embrace shown in card rearrangement and descent; flaws like failure to touch drive micro-choices. Final renunciation of unified self feels earned via prior causality. Minor slip in stock self-diagnosis ("not madness, but a fragmented reality") slightly abstracts peak motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of symbols (cards, threads, constellations) builds to cadence shift in descent and shard alignment. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with conceptual cost ("live divided yet shining") legible in final image. Orientation anchored early (artist in lighthouse library); one tightening via tremor/lover's face pivots to redesign.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Salt-stained light, tilting shelves, and spiral stairs constrain choices (rummaging, dimming bulb, descent) and charge final image of base with oil drums/lenses. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (painterly glows, threads). Environment mirrors internal fragmentation evolving causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend fragmented self) signaled early, tightens texturally via card reassignment narrowing to descent agency; cost felt in foreclosed unity ("divided yet shining"). Escalation coheres under Accumulative lens without reversal overload. Protagonist endurance reconfigures options with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of self-redesign via borrowed symbols emerges organically from card portraits and descent; final image resonant non-literal answer to grief's fragmentation without moralizing. Subtext in threads/implication enriches ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from question of living divided.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (inks as threads, shards hushing); rhythmic control modulates from pulse to echo in descent. Lyrical diction voice-motivated, legible under textural lens. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors coherent (warped box as drowned heart, shards hushing). Minor overwrite in rhetorical question cluster ("he wondered") creates template cadence run mid-story, dulling one beat without touching closure. Propulsion clear, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tarot/portraits in lighthouse reweights reality premise via threads; risk in lyric descent heightens stakes. Non-obvious turn from accident grief to possible-selves canvas feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
