<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Narrator's skepticism shows contradictory impulses in sarcasm versus cataloguing names as evidence; earned shift in final rebalancing with relational cost. Evan's confession compels higher stakes, embodied in work-scarred fingers on beads. Minor slip: epiphany slightly told in closing lines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure: final image reweights skepticism via shared truth with emotional cost ("small rebalancing"). Orientation anchored early in tunnel mouth. One tightening via metallic rhythm and beads narrows doubt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tunnel's mineral cold, drip, and beams constrain movement and charge beads as altar in final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects narrator's practiced chill; coherent choreography. POV bias filters rosary crown selectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to prove ghost shift signaled early; density deepens via confession and phantom footfalls, forcing endurance of doubt with shared cost at end. Agency in pressing forward reconfigures relational options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Swallowed truth emerges via confession and beads without statement; final pipe-forehead whisper reweights skepticism organically. Ambiguity lingers in ghost vs. guilt. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct skeptical perceptual signature ("practiced chill"); dialogue subtextual with idiom distinction (Evan's whispers vs. narrator's sarcasm). Stable first-person; rhythm modulates to drowsy cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor paraphrase loop on "swallowed truth" and "religiously skeptical" dulls slightly (-0.3). No artifacts in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio psychics and corporate ghosts transforms mill fire trope; risk in poetic voice heightens stakes. Particular beads and tunnel feel inevitable.</comment>
