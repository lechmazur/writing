<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the scene—polish lie vs. theft urge—and final internalization of diary method is earned by prior curiosity and gentle unlocking, with visible cost in foreclosed theft. Interiority concrete and particular, embodied in gloved tracing and murmured apologies. No diagnostic labels; flaws like punished warmth drive mistakes without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of revelations tightens from elevator ascent to diary CR, reweighting premise of suffering with legible conceptual cost in "eyes tuned to the joy beneath anguish." Orientation anchored early ("elevator hummed...icebound spire"); single scene coherent, no disorientation debt. Closure CR on-page, constraint of goggles/script persists to final descent image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Goggles as recurring tool constrain choices (reveal script on door/lock/diary) and charge final image via "scattered light" pattern; icebound spire pressures with cold/frost guiding tactile navigation. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: servant notices brass, seams, warmth in metal. Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal shift from frost to warmed metal/diary steam.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seek joy beneath anguish) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via unlocking deepening (kindness over force) and diary reading that narrows options to internalization over theft. Agency in micro-choices like pressing script/apologies; cost legible in unchanged servant status but reconfigured perception on descent. One tightening sufficient; minor abstractness in stakes vs. visceral embodiment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars—nobles' coded complaints, diary's annotated joys, margins of Etta's life—offering resonant non-literal answer in final "invisible script," reweighting prior anguish patterns without moralizing. Subtext in affectionate detachment toward ghosts/door; earned wisdom from concrete experience avoids platitudes. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question of hidden gladness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in warmly selective noticing ("affectionate detachment," light as steam/script); rhythmic control modulates with intensity, compressing under cold ascent/stress. Single POV stable, no head-hopping; diction biased to servant-scholar lens (seams, code). No dialogue, but internal voice coherent/specific; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at CR.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "script was no language she knew, yet it felt like the nobles' complaints"); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops/templates/artifacts in peak diary beat. Figurative coherent/patterned (frost ferns, steam lines, petals unfolding); propulsion matches scene, opening anchors voice/stakes, final recharges motifs. Zero scaffold; clean grammar/syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sky-palace hierarchies, light-revealing goggles, diary annotating cruelty with joy transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in accumulative lyric structure heightens stakes via pattern-taught revelations. Non-obvious turn: encryption insists on joy annotation, inevitable in hindsight from early noble code. Bold voice commits to premise without retreat; emotional specificity anchors universals.</comment>
