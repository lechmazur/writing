<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Neve's interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses in official duty versus personal chalk codes acting simultaneously; micro-choices like sketching names reveal hierarchy of values. Final choice of "Marin Verge" earned by prior causality, foreclosing impersonal bureaucracy with felt personal cost. Flaws like "eavesdropping on their own ghosts" complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from name sketches to chalk codes, culminating in Charged Poise closure as envelope rests at slot, reconfiguring letter's path with "care that felt like apology" as legible emotional cost. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in arcade at dawn. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly filters through Neve's priorities: glass ribs and dimming lights mirror internal leakage, counter as "hinge" constrains final act. Sensory selection purposeful, narrowing to chalk dust and palm heat under reflective pressure. Recurring counter charges closure image, guiding walk to slot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (name juxtaposing past/future selves) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via deepening sketches and codes that personalize, narrowing to stance crystallization at slot. Protagonist agency in choices forecloses neutral aliases with cost felt in "future pause." Pressure coheres without static loops.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reincarnation via names emerges organically from particulars like "Alia Vent" trials, answered non-literally in "You are allowed to arrive slowly" and poised drop. Final image reweights sender's question with resonant ambiguity, no moralizing. Counter-readings in forgiveness vs. risk linger authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: lyrical bias toward "futuristic nostalgia" in phrases like "memory someone had projected onto the future." Rhythm modulates from expansive reflection to taut final beat. No elision or head-hopping; diction reflects inventive mind under quiet stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; rhythm varies naturally, propelling from "names refused to stay" to "whole future pause." Varied syntax and concrete images like "chalk dust" replace generics. Closure image crisp, read-aloud charged without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pseudonym creation as "controlled reincarnation" in futuristic post office transforms tropes via chalk codes and "subconscious review." Risky lyric Accumulative frame heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
