<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Characters deeply embodied through actions like stretching the tape and dealing cards; contradictory impulses shine in Jonas's skepticism yielding to "Teach me," earning the shared mapping with relational cost. Minor telling in "steadily curious temperament" but shown via persistent ritual under collapse pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from solo ritual to joint axis at "zero lay between them," delivering Charged Poise closure reconfiguring patterns sideways with conceptual cost of abandoned vertical empires. Orientation anchors early via loft and post-crash hum; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and scarred floorboards constrain ritual choices and charge final shared map; sensory hierarchy (drips as analog time) reflects Mara's priorities. Final line's loft evolution mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping post-crash trajectories tightens texturally via Jonas's arrival and "us" revelation, narrowing to sideways growth with felt endurance cost; agency in inviting and teaching forecloses solo path. Minor abstractness in early stakes declaration but converges cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of belief's reverse engineering emerges via Tower/Fool cards and tape, answered non-literally in "futures that wove his choices through hers" reweighting vertical fall to patient sideways unknown. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "patiently unknown."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in onyx-ink sigils and rain-drip time; dialogue subtextual ("Still trying to turn gossip into geometry") advances while distinct (Jonas blunt, Mara poetic). Stable close-third on Mara with rhythmic control under dialogue pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "cables dangled like ivy"; varied rhythm propels to closure, but minor overwriting in metaphors ("cautious comets") clusters without full payoff in peak joint mapping. No loops obscure cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy, tape rituals, and crypto-collapse yields inevitable "sideways" reconfiguration; risky poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes via lived specifics like sigil's spiral.</comment>
