<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (recapture vs. self-rescue) act in the theater confrontation, earning the final renunciation of professional duty with embodied cost in "the bars bending inward."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from ship navigation to theater; Conceptual Repricing closure lands on-page when theater becomes garden, reweighting premise with cost of "every change carried the weight of all the versions erased."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ship's maze constrains choices via "narrative threads"; recurring fog and rust evolve causally, charging final image where rust runs backward under revised stories.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find twin/garden to escape classification) signaled early and tightens via dialogue reversal in theater, narrowing to agency of staying with legible cost in abandoned life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rewriting vs. classifying emerges organically from particulars; final image of "impossible lives keep burning" offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting freedom's trap without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in surreal noticing ("time thickens"); first-person stability with rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; minor figurative density in opening fits taught pattern but risks slight overwrites in navigation beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of carnival ship and internal garden transforms tropes; risk-taking in memory-altered time heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via twin's revelation.</comment>
