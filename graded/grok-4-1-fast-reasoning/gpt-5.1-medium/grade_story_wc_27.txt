<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied in toes curling on deck and feet pressing into vibrating plating; contradictory fear folds into decisive question, earning the wrist-comm message with trembling cost. Final micro-choice reveals values hierarchy without tidy resolution. Single-POV strengths unmarred by reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from waiting to flickering images to message sent; Charged Poise closure on "Meet at the stones..." reconfigures indecision with legible trembling cost. Orientation anchored early in spaceport bay; single scene holds tightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stones' hum rises in attention and sings through bones, constraining her deeper press and charging visions; opera glasses frame bruised sky as scripture, mirroring internal shift. Sensory selection (rust/dust underfoot, static sky) POV-biased and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end lull, find meaning) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fear rearrangement and images to message-agency; cost in "trembling" fingers and foreclosed hollow-burning felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rebellion as "sequence of sparks" and "long exhale" emerges organically from particulars; final message offers resonant answer to coherence-chase without moralizing, reweighting mess via stones' memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with stargazer perceptual signature (cathedral arches in hulls, static voices in sky); rhythmic modulation builds to thunderous serenity without drift or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and integrated imagery (e.g., "serenity with teeth"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures—peak "stones sang up through her bones" clarifies closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sci-fi spaceport pierced by ancient stones synthesizes mystic rebellion freshly; barefoot sensing and opera glasses transform tropes into irreplaceable charges for quiet reignition.</comment>
