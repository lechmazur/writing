<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—Council's randomness vs. deliberate sequencing—act in pivotal door openings, earning final oath to bear patterns with isolation's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as patterned openings build density to CR closure; final clarity reconfigures stakes with underground isolation cost legible in oath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pagoda's facets and orbiting atoms constrain sequential choices, evolve with light's thrum, and charge final coalesced image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake of averting collapse escalates via agency in rejecting randomness, deepening to unbearable memory with cost of refined innocence and solitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final CR reweights premise—memory unbearable—answering pattern's danger through oath, resonant via pagoda coalescence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third with historian's perceptual signature (constellations tugging, rust breath) modulates rhythmically under pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to peak; coherent metaphors (nostalgia atoms slowing) heighten realization without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesis of memory-prism dispensing patterned prophecies transforms collapse trope; risk of dense lyricism heightens conceptual stakes to inevitable CR.</comment>
