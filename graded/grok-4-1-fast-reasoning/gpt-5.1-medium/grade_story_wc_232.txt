<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in pictured retreat vs. faint path amid rising water; choice earned by "empirically intuitive" sifting of lattice with embodied cost in ribs-deep cold. Internal conflict embodied without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure at "wall softened... He followed" with cost legible in "pooling cold around his ribs" and foreclosed safe route; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to cadence shift, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Blooming cavern constrains crawl and decision, petals "brushed his neck with damp, fragrant mouths"; recurring creek pulse and pollen shafts charge final image, sensory hierarchy via intuitive notice of ants/ore.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (doorway decision) tightens via water surge and path lattice under Accumulative lens; agency crystallizes on faint path, unmistakable cost in "staying still was itself a decision" and pictured shop return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final "at last he was choosing" offers resonant reconfiguration of promise/maps theme without moral; lattice paths and ants reweight "routes not taken" organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in "ants... black punctuation marks" and chip "lines unfolded"; rhythmic control modulates to short, urgent sentences in crawl/decision, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in cavern beats with purposeful "creek rises" cadence build; no loops, varied syntax propels to closure, minor figurative density (petals as "mouths") taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Doorway "hinge in reality tuned to choice" transforms map-quest via chip/ant synthesis; surreal cavern risk heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from empirical intuition constraint.</comment>
