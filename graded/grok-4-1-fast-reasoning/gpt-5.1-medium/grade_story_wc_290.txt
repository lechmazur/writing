<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak powerfully in the descent hesitation ("every instinct clawing upward toward open sky, yet the music's silent plea held him"), earned by prior micro-choices like trusting the compass over nerves; interiority embodied and particular throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of spatial discrepancies tightening to Charged Poise closure at descent ("He drew one final steady breath and descended, accepting the key might change him first"); cost legible in clawing instinct, orientation anchored early in canyon arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting as micro-setting (starbeam, flagstones, pedestal socket) constrains pivotal choices like hall selection and activation; spatial choreography coherent despite taught distortions, charging final staircase image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant claustrophobia-vs-discovery stake signaled early, escalates accumulatively through hall ripple/choice to stair reveal with agency-driven deepening; cost felt in ribs/prison bars fear persisting to final trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wistful rebellion theme emerges organically from temple's "slow, reluctant sigh" and protagonist's "patient rebellion," reweighted non-literally in descent image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (measuring breaths, spatial whispers); rhythmic control modulates tension purposefully, no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but figurative language dense in climax ("vibration crawled through his boots and knelt his balance") borders overwriting without muddle; no loops, varied rhythm supports accumulative ear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spatial mutiny via compass/organ tube transforms temple trope organically; risk-taking in textural distortions heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight descent.</comment>
