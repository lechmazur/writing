<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices culminate in the subversive poem and free walk, earning a credible shift from remembered fear to fragile certainty with visible cost in renouncing the sanctioned role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from footsteps to poem's echo and final walk; Charged Poise closure lands on-page in "stride through boundaries that were never sacred, only afraid," reconfiguring silence with conceptual cost of past fear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Quartz colonnade and dust in blue light constrain path and charge poem/response, mirroring internal states through tactile hum that evolves with steps and voice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming voice tightens via poem's risk and final renunciation, with agency in speaking literal truth; cost legible in fragile certainty amid historical pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of art dissolving control emerges organically from resonant hall and poem, with final image offering non-literal reconfiguration of boundaries as afraid, not sacred.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (shadow/weather fragments) stable in third-limited POV, modulating rhythm with hush to thickening echo; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from hush to ascending scale; minor figurative density purposeful in lyric mode, no loops or scaffolds dulling peak poem beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of banned resonant architecture and poet's return transforms silence trope; risk in lyrical boundaries-dissolving voice heightens closure stakes organically.</comment>
