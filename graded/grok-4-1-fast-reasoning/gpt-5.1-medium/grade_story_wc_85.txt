<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions like "scars itch with a guilt" and micro-choices under pressure culminating in earned renunciation of forgery; final gathering of carvings forecloses silence path with felt regret cost, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via note-to-shore progression and symbol match; CR closure in gathering carvings reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost of exposing shielded lives, legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Driftwood shore and dusk light constrain sifting choice and charge emblem discovery; selective sensory hierarchy (murmurs, fingertips tracing) mirrors genealogist bias, with setting evolving causally to payoff.</comment>
