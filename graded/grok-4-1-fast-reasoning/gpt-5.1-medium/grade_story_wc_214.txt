<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (shadow with mop vs. pull to listen) act in scene, culminating in earned whisper-promise with vulnerability cost; embodied emotions (chest ache, ribs pull) ground interiority without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from star maps to human moments to stillness, delivering CR closure in "broom as staff" image with exposure cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Broom and lantern glass recur as micro-settings constraining choices (slid from hand, gripped as staff) and charging final image; sensory bias (dust as nebulae, warm hum) filters through janitor's empathic priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witness beneath silence) deepens accumulatively via projection shifts narrowing to vulnerability, crystallized in agency-driven promise foreclosing invisibility with felt exposure cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final "promise to keep watching" reweights witnessing theme non-literally through broom-staff image, emerging organically from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (empathizing vents/pipes, dust as nebulae) and rhythmic modulation under intensifying insight maintain stable close-third POV without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "falling stars curved like a question"); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle in peak stillness beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms janitor trope via lantern's heart-tracing geometry into inevitable "flourishing stillness" synthesis; bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
