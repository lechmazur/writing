<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via suspicion of her "appetite for drama" embodied in slow setup choices; final renunciation of explosive focus earned by flood backstory interleaved with present micro-choices like taping leaks. Amir's presence forces clarifying dialogue revealing values. Voice coherent and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to Amir exchange to final taping, culminating in CR closure where "smudges creeping across paper" reweights premise with patience cost. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no lens ambiguity. One tightening via dialogue suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains choices (leaks force taping, damp "remembers water" mirroring stake) and charges final image of deliberate pace amid ruin. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (science on silt/smells); weather (squall, puddle) affects action. Micro-setting (cracked pots, vines) tactile and evolving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (track gradual change for quiet quakes) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Amir dialogue crystallizing inference method; cost legible in endurance of imperfect space ("no, but that is the point"). Agency in narrowing variables; one decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of accretion vs catastrophe emerges organically via flood echo to dust proxy; final image resonant non-literal answer ("truths arrived, quiet and cumulative") reweights prior supernova hunger without moralizing. Subtext in Amir exchange; complexity in humbled ambition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (science filters: "gravity braided matter"); dialogue natural/subtextual ("listen for dust"), distinct voices. Rhythmic control modulates from reflective to crisp action; no head-hopping, elisions absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "wind shoved a fresh squall... vines shiver"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (silt accretion). Zero scaffold; figurative selective, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: low-tech dust greenhouse proxies neutron star crusts, transforming post-disaster scientist trope via grounded humility; risk in quiet CR ending heightens stakes (+0.3). Premise inevitable in hindsight, no derivatives.</comment>
