<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's personality borrowing vividly embodies cryptic depth, shown through specific traits like brother's slouch; protagonist's grief reconfiguration is earned via halo-touched choices with embodied cost in staggered realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in "geometry dissolved... triviality of my old, tidy grief," legible cost reweighting premise; orientation anchored early in workshop entry, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Topaz workshop and halo constrain choices (press lever, hand on halo), charging final dissolution image; sensory details like "topaz letters kissing paper" integrate purposefully without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to solve grief via emotion math tightens accumulatively through feeling choice and halo touch, agency foreclosing tidy grief with cost in "rearranged variables"; pressure coheres to closure without abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of emotion as transposable equations emerges from particulars like printed geometry, resonant CR in final line reweighting grief without moral; ambiguity lingers organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in textured noticing ("grief hums beneath an ordinary day"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, voice modulates seamlessly under halo pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; metaphors cohere (e.g., "drawer everyone rummaged through") without muddle in peak halo beat, zero loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dying stars printing emotions via topaz/halo transforms tropes; personality borrowing and transposed empathy feel inevitable, risking bold conceptual frame.</comment>
