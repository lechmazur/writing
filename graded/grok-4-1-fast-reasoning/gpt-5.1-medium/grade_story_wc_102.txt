<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arun's motivation roots deeply in embodied chest ache and breathing hitches, culminating in earned release when he approaches the boy; contradictory impulses emerge in withheld gestures visualized as lanterns. Interiority particular via past-life drowning and monk's teachings avoids stock epiphanies. Final micro-choice to breathe with boy forecloses isolation with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of lantern/spark visions builds to RR closure: lantern floats from chest after boy's interaction, reweighting unused love with conceptual cost of unspent orbits released. Orientation anchors viaduct/mist/ twilight early. Single scene tightens via camera experiment to pilgrim revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Viaduct's mist and climbing roses constrain choice as thin-boundary site, charging final image where lanterns drift into arches; sensory filter (fog crawling, lanterns flickering like ribs) mirrors internal tides. Body as micro-setting: chest gravity pulls until exhale. Evolves causally with fog upward crawl paralleling release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate/release unused love) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via camera's spark procession tightening to boy's swarm, forcing agency in shared breathing; cost legible as loosened lantern paints faces blue before rising. One deepening suffices, agency crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unused love as lingering pause emerges via lantern sparks, reweighted non-literally in final drift joining unseen others for world-healing implication. Particulars (drowned wife's hand, father's weep) avoid platitudes; boy's wet eyes elicit honest aftereffect without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (shorelines in lungs, gravity of orbits) biases toward foggy-spiritual idiom, stable close-third; minimal dialogue natural ("Breathe with me") pursues goal subtly. Rhythm modulates with pressure, compression in visions purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "light folded and refolded" advances image and revelation); metaphors consistent in smoke/spark/wool logic, no muddle. Minor density slips in opening metaphors don't touch closure; varied rhythm, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Camera obscura fused with Kwan Yin's Tear transforms spiritual tropes into spark pilgrimage, inevitable in hindsight; bold lyric risk (corridor bending to pulsing wound) heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
