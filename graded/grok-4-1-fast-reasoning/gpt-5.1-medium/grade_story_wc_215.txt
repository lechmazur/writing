<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to preserve silence drives all micro-choices, like nodding over speaking and opening the box, earning the final endurance with embodied contradiction (almost laughing). Interiority particular through bee analogies and perceptual bias. Mara's pressure reveals relational crucible without stock traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from apiary silence to covenant revelation, tightening via box opening that reconfigures ghost intentions. CR closure in final hush reweights premise with conceptual cost of isolation. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stained glass box as micro-setting constrains climax choice and charges final image, bending light through Mara. Sensory details (wind hiss, dust motes) selective via beekeeper POV, mirroring internal quiet. Wasteland evolves with ghosts' boldness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve unsaid vs. ghosts claiming) signaled early, textural escalation via Mara's approach and covenant glow narrowing to endurance choice. Agency in silent witness forecloses speech path with felt isolation cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence-meaning covenant emerges from particulars like grooves and hush, final image offering non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in Mara's whispers and protagonist's restraint invites ambiguity. Resonance from bee navigation callback.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (contextual clues, translucent curls) biases noticing; voice modulates rhythmically with intensity. Stable single POV, no leakage. Dialogue sparse but subtextual, advancing via implication.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels; metaphors consistent (bees, smoke) without muddle. Minor figurative density in climax but pattern-taught and legible. No loops or scaffolds; final line recharges motifs crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghosts-bees-silence transforms haunting trope via covenant grooves and mute trust. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable particulars like queen-rearing shed inflect turns.</comment>
