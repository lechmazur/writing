<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's contradictory impulses—almost turning back at rain but kneeling to study puddles—act in scene, compelling the transmission choice with embodied cost (throat aches, exhausted heartbeat). Interiority particular via absences traced in markets; flaws like potential unworthiness yield to earned action. Final renunciation of watching drives closure without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of market gaps, puddle maps, lagoon discovery tightens to CR closure (paper codes reweight erasure premise) with cost in exhaustion and promise. Orientation anchored early (key in pocket); no debt. Puddle-to-gate progression causal under lens, pattern taught via rumor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Puddles constrain choice (phantom lane guides path) and charge final image (booth reappears in them). Sensory selective (fractured lights, auric glow); POV bias toward absences vivid. Lagoon under starlight mirrors defiance, evolving with rain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve unedited memory) signaled via key; puddle deepening narrows options under Accumulative lens, forcing endurance at booth with legible cost (throat aches pulsing with lagoon). Agency in speaking forecloses indifference; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of refusing indifference emerges via particulars (erased booths, spoken memories); final paper/strip and puddle reprise reweight premise non-literally. Subtext in "coded freedom" undercurrents; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in distribution promise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature (negative spaces, reflections); stable single POV, rhythmic modulation under pressure (short sentences at gate slip). Machine voice ironic/warm fits; no head-hopping, elision purposeful via absences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., stacked clauses build puddle urgency); metaphors coherent (gum scraped off pavement, diluted metal). Minor figurative density in lagoon description purposeful, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Puddle-reflection map transforms erasure trope into tactile discovery; auric lagoon/phone booth synthesis fresh, risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; final reappearance inevitable from absences pattern.</comment>
