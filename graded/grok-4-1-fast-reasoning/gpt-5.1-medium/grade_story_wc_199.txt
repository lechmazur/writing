<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio's obsessive sorting and fear of "almost but not quite knowing" create contradictory impulses, earning the planting choice; monuments to forgotten things particularize interiority and drive transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via leaf patterns to special leaf's map and voice, landing RR via planting with cost in Lio's "deciding the answer before I truly hear"; orientation anchored early, lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ashen skyborne arbor's grooves, niches, and roots constrain sorting-to-planting shift, charging final image as "floor...opened" and "roots" receive seeds; sensory selectivity (coolness, sap) mirrors stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding without misunderstanding tightens via voice's invitation, forcing renunciation of pure listening; cost legible in deliberate planting foreclosing eternal sorting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Monuments as "alphabet without knowing its sound" reweights listening-to-speaking via map, offering resonant non-literal answer in valley's "new story beginning" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("slow green comets," "eternally almost falling") biases toward patterns, stable single POV with rhythmic modulation suiting fable-like hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (leaf unfolds "into a veined map"); varied rhythm propels from hush to "sky...brightened," zero loops or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Skyborne arbor from "valley's question to the moon" synthesizes folklore into fresh accumulative drive, risking lyric mode where monuments transform absence into shared growth.</comment>
