<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in "prophecy pressing—like breath against a membrane," with contradictory nostalgia and vigilance driving micro-choices like sharp notes; endurance earned but reflection on family duty borders BRR excess without always tilting present tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with tightening density at "phrase broke through" reversal, leading to Charged Poise closure in sun's radiance and "ragged hushes" cost; orientation anchored early, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism atrium and dewdrops constrain melody-matching choice and charge final radiance image, with sensory integration via "ribbons of color that danced against the wet walls"; lived-in choreography perfect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to hush prophecy escalates accumulatively via heavier pressure and on-page breakthrough, forcing agency in sharp notes with ragged breath cost; single tightening sufficient and legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sound-imposed silence emerges organically from negative-space tactics, resonant in final "eerie nostalgia for a time when silence was not yet necessary" reweighting duty's conceptual cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature ("breath and the morning fog became one") modulates rhythmically under pressure; stable close-third POV, purposeful compression taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but figurative density in climax ("thread through a needle, sealing the gaps") borders overwrite without muddle; no loops, purposeful mist recurrence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musical mysticism hushing coded prophecy transforms tropes via negative-space mechanics; bold lyric risk heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at sharp-note climax.</comment>
