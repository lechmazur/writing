<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via touch and sound (e.g., "fingers trailing across the bark to read its growth rings like Braille"), with motivation rooted in blindness as qualification; earned internal change at stillpoint. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for 9+ test, leaning epiphanic over conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to harmony revelation as RR/Charged Poise with legible emotional cost in "wept without sadness." Orientation anchored early (blind Elara in forest); one tightening via note trail suffices. Closure cost explicit in final inward radiation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest and ring constrain blind navigation (e.g., "vibrated with tiny earthquakes of insect movement"), charging final earth-heartbeat image; sensory hierarchy blind-specific (sound/touch over sight). Purposeful details mirror emotional terrain without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find stillpoint) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via shifting notes and star-pause silence forcing deeper listening; agency in deliberate steps/lying down forecloses external seeking with internal cost felt on-page. One tightening reweights options inward.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of emotional navigation via stillness emerges organically from sensory pursuit, resonant in final soul-map image reweighting premise without moralizing. Complexity in opposites' harmony avoids tidy binary; earned via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with blind perceptual signature (ultrasonic hums, tactile reading); voice lyrical and rhythmic, modulating to quiet intensity at "held breath." No head-hopping; diction character-bound to sensory bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors during approach (e.g., "thirsty roots drawing water from stone") risks coherence without pattern payoff; no loops or scaffolds dull closure image. Propulsion strong via image integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind sonic cartography and skin-absorbing ring transforms quest trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens emotional stakes, inevitable in hindsight via stillpoint payoff. No derivative echoes; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
