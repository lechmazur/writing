<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied (camera wheel heavy with others' futures), contradictory impulses in collecting proof vs. confronting ghost directly build to earned renunciation; speech at climax reveals values hierarchy without diagnostic excess. Minor abstraction in "eroded ambitions" phrasing feels stock once.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragment density accumulates to ghost appearance and camera spin capturing unlived possibilities, yielding CR closure in "exhaustion, too, is a kind of peace" with legible conceptual cost of unrestored self. Orientation anchors early (Mira/scavenger, lagoon post-carousel); single scene coherent, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lagoon's physics (boots on water, voices dissolving) constrain movement/choices and mirror internal erosion, charging final stillness; recurring "light without sun" recharges bookend image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific, purposeful surrealism integrates via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiate ghost terms) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fragment weight/ghost sighting to agency in photographing/speaking, foreclosing restoration path; cost felt in silence/exhaustion. One tightening sufficient, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eroded ambitions/ghosts theme emerges organically from particulars (overheard fragments, camera sediment), final image reconfigures premise—failure ordinary yields peace without literal answer; ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct, perceptual bias (scavenger notices unlived stories) consistent; rhythm modulates from melodic ribbons to fractured stillness. Stable single POV, purposeful compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (every line advances texture/stake), rhythm varies read-aloud; figurative pattern (erosion/smoke/sediment) coherent, purposeful. Minor repetition ("light without sun") echoes effectively without loop; peak clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Surreal premise (lagoon voices, camera etching confessions) fresh synthesis of regret/ambition, ghost negotiation transformative; risk in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
