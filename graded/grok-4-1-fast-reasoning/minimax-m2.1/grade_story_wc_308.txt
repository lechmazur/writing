<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular (dust settling her shape, limbs texturing like bone), with endurance earned through centuries' stasis; historically reverent trait complicates via prison/sanctuary tension without alternating summaries. Minor flaw: internal conflict emerges more accumulatively than simultaneous impulses acting in peak apex moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pulse density spreads to apex then contracts, yielding CR closure in final paragraph's reweighting of navigation (spirit over body) with undeniable stasis cost (tower as prison/sanctuary). Orientation anchored early (tower, canyon, arrowhead); single scene fits defaults, pattern taught immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bone towers and dust layers constrain stillness and charge final image (peace "weathered and ancient as the bones"); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (echoes, bird patterns, pulse ripples). Details evolve causally (dust shifts seasons, light slants afternoon).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (spirit-navigation amid passage dangers) signaled via birds; tightening at apex deepens reach/knowledge under Accumulative lens, forcing endurance trade-off with embodied cost (stiff limbs). Subtle agency in sustained pulse, but stakes viscerally felt less via reversal than density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of spiritual navigation emerges organically from pulse/birds/arrowhead accumulation, resonating in final CR image without direct statement; arrowhead reprise shifts from physical tool to tiller of spirit. Minor drift toward articulation ("true navigation was not about...") borders echo but integrates via priors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (resonances, trajectories as texts); rhythmic modulation builds to apex warmth/cooling. Lyrical compression taught early (pulse expansion), legible at closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., bird patterns cueing dangers propel awareness); varied syntax/rhythm passes ear test, no loops/artifacts even in reflective blocks. Strategic telling anchors backstory efficiently; zero scaffold dulls apex or closure image.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lyric stasis in bone-canyon skimmer transforms hermit trope via pulse-navigation ingenuity; risk-taking in nonlinear time-weave (centuries → daily cycle) heightens stakes of immobility, inevitable in hindsight via arrowhead/pulse.</comment>
