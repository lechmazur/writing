<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mina's embodied realizations via sensory rings (scent of grandmother's kitchen, forgotten laughter) reveal character-particular interiority and earn her final agency; researcher's enigmatic withholding aligns with sworn traits. Minor slip: researcher verges on wise-mentor archetype without deeper contradiction until Mina's vision of him as boy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ripples progressively deepen knowledge toward CR closure; Mina's stone toss crystallizes before/after with lifelong learning cost legible in "spend the rest of her life learning." Orientation anchored early (shore, floating rock, pond); single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pond and stone constrain revelation method and charge final image (her throw restarts rings); sycamores' hush filters perception selectively. Sensory details (starlit pond darker than sky, mossy bank) integrate into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn vanishing) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ring-deepening that narrows to self-realization; fourth ring forces stance shift with felt cost of recursive teaching chain. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of delayed revelation emerges organically from ripples reweighting "vanishing" premise; final image answers central question non-literally via Mina's throw echoing chain without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited Mina with perceptual bias (whispering leaves she can't hear); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Truth withholds itself"). Rhythmic control modulates from hush to deeper silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (ripples, hush) taught early; no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("smooth as worry") purposeful for texture, supports propulsion without muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guru trope via backwards-aging and ripple revelations transforms into conceptual chain; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
