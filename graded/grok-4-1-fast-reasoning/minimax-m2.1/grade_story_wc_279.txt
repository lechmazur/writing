<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the mandala work and flake insertion, earning the final renunciation of permanence with embodied cost in the slowing heartbeat and warm tile; interiority particular via chalk arguments and comfortable wound valuing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to CR closure in the emergent hush reweighting art's mess with conceptual cost of accepted impermanence; flake discovery and insertion provide motivated tightening without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Whispering grotto's mist, hush, and tiles constrain choices via alignments and resonances, charging final exhale image; sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's perceptual bias, selective and vivid.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlearning tightens accumulatively through noticing patterns to flake interjection, forcing renunciation with legible cost in foreclosed permanence; one deepening suffices, agency clear in hands listening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mess-as-peace emerges organically from mandala spirals and hush clarifying heartbeat/drips; final image resonant reconfiguration answers permanence premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in chalk-stone moods and word-shapes; rhythmic modulation builds hush texture purposefully, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm and integrated senses; minor hush repetition patterned for payoff, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chalk mandala and resonant tile flake transforms unlearning trope; risky lyric hush cadence heightens closure stakes organically.</comment>
