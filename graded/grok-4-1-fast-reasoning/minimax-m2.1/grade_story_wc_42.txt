<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied grief tied to father's clock promise; contradictory impulses peak in choosing to photograph motion rather than halt it. Minor slip in epiphanic directness ("I understand at last") borders unearned but anchored by prior tremor cue. Final renunciation of stopping time feels earned with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density building to CR closure: photographing spinning hand reconfigures grief with legible cost ("escaped the gravity of my grief"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; tremor beat tightens without causality break. Single scene coheres perfectly for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Trembling foundations and thin air constrain restructuring choice; clock hand as recurring micro-setting charges final image. Sensory details (condensation rivers, luminous ache) filtered through POV urgency. No white-room; spatial choreography (workshop edge, viewing platforms) vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harness ephemeral) signaled early, escalates texturally via tremor pattern break narrowing to acceptance over force. Agency in shutter clicks forecloses stopping hand with felt cost. One decisive deepening suffices; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of acceptance-over-force emerges organically from clock-camera parallel, resonant in final image without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from restructuring insight; ambiguity lingers in hand's persistence. No thematic echo or platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("luminous ache," spinning as "constancy") biases noticing; rhythmic modulation heightens tremor intensity. Stable first-person POV with no leakage; lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. Prose reflects sage's geometry-knowing mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short tremor sentences propel). Minor overwriting in figurative density ("clouds roil and reform like living things") during peak but pattern-consistent, no muddle at closure. No loops or scaffolds; read-aloud propulsion clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera repairer in lunar observatory transforms trope of endless wait via textural insight. Risky lyric risk-taking (spinning hand motif) heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious CR feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
