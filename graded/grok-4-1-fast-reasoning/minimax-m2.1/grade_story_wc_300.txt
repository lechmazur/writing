<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Margret's motivation as inspector shifts convincingly through embodied hesitation ("fingers hovering above the water's surface") to earned action (lifting pearl), revealing contradictory impulses between duty and epiphany; interiority particular via her "bitter lesson" history. Minor slip in overt therapy-speak ("dissolve the walls between hearts") borders unearned but doesn't undermine pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries (cave, pool, shells) build density to Conceptual Repricing closure: pearl lift and shell dispersal reconfigures "walls" premise with legible bittersweet cost ("facility would be sealed, preserved, forgotten"). Single continuous scene with no orientation debt; one tightening via shell-reading suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal cave and pool constrain choices (climbing gap, reaching water) and charge final image (light threading "colors of every abandoned hope"); sensory details (rust smell, crunching quartz, pulsing luminescence) selectively bias via inspector's eye, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bunker evaluation) deepens accumulatively via shell-reading reversal, narrowing to stance crystallization (send shells despite sealing); agency in hesitation-to-lift forecloses isolation path with felt cost in final plan. Escalation coherent under lens, one tightening charges closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of connection over walls emerges organically from pearl gathering hopes/shells, culminating in resonant CR ("first crack had been made"); subtext in etched apologies invites ambiguity without moralizing. Minor friction in direct articulation ("people needed to dissolve the walls") slightly undercuts emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (inspector's structural lens on "expired rations and rusted bunks" refracted by crystals); rhythmic modulation peaks in hush ("stones themselves were holding their breath"), no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "light that existed in potential, gathered from every reflection" advances radiance while charging pearl); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figurative coherence in peak cave beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bunker trope with radiant pearl/shell confessions transforms doomsday prep into heart-connection threshold; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable CR, no derivative echoes.</comment>
