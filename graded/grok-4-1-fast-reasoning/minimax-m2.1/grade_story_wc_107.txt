<question>1</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Strong embodied interiority via calloused hands and glass intimacy; motivation to craft inquiry zones earned through scarred objects paralleling heart's thaw. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "internal glaciers" borders therapy-speak without full embodied cost, but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via thawing density building to CR closure in final vessel/bookmark image with vulnerability cost. Orientation anchored early in control room; single tightening from cooling tank to glory hole narrows internal options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Melting icicles and rusted consoles constrain contemplative mood, charging final cascade parallel; bookmark and glass as micro-settings evolve to reweight scars in ending image. Sensory selection (weeping icicles, molten glow) reflects POV priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake of internal thawing signaled early, escalates via textural density (ice release mirroring glass softening) forcing vulnerability crystallization under lens. One deepening in "un Freezing of something essential" forecloses protective walls with felt risk cost on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of scarred safety zones emerges organically from glass/vessel particulars, resonant CR in final pairing reweights inquiry's vulnerability without moralizing. Returning thaw motif shifts from external to internal without token recurrence.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature in glass/lover heartbeat metaphors modulates rhythmically; stable close third-person POV biases toward craft metaphors. Theatrical solo dialogue ("Now then") carries subtext of spirited isolation naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High density with purposeful metaphor clusters (thaw/glass) propels accumulatively; varied syntax breathes with scene. Minor overwrite in repetitive "thawing" patterns borders loop but teaches lyric cadence without dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of glassblowing as inquiry sanctuary transforms occupational trope via abandoned control room specificity. Final scarred vessel/bookmark reconfigures premise inventively without gimmick.</comment>
