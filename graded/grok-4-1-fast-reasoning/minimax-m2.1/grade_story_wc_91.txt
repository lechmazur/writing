<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied ("heart ache with recognition"); motivation rooted in prior acts (signing away estate) compels uncorking jars as micro-choice under eclipse pressure. Final becoming ("destitute and luminous") earned via accumulative walk. Minor diagnostic edge in epiphany line but doesn't flatten contradiction between holding/releasing light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: backstory anchors (~100 words) tilt present (detour to beach); density tightens to eclipse apex CR ("transformation... continuous becoming") with cost in "beauty that she would never keep." Single scene, no orientation debt, closure legible with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Black sand "hums... warm from volcano's breath yet cool" constrains footing/sandals, charges final image (footsteps remembered); sensory hierarchy (tide hesitation, volcano breathing) mirrors internal hush. POV bias filters prophecy through body/environment; volcano rumble recognizes her, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of transformation) signaled via walking/questions; textural escalation via bug release/density surge to eclipse forces stance crystallization (uncorking as agency). Cost unmistakable in "destitute... purposeless and prowling"; one decisive cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from bug/light motifs shifting to "holding beauty... never keep," reweighting prophecy as accidental becoming without moral state. Final image answers central question resonantly via particulars (bugs spell message); no tidy binary, embraces luminous cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct ("slow dance of celestial bodies," "vibrant hush"); perceptual signature biased to luminescence/prophecy ("lightning bugs... patient shadows"). Stable close-third POV; compression taught early, peaks legible at eclipse without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short hush sentences amid lyrical swells); density high but purposeful, no loops. Minor figurative density ("water through fingers, wind through paper") in release beat risks muddle but coheres texturally without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bug refugees as prophecy-fulfilling light hoard amid volcano eclipse transforms destitute walk into luminous CR. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; no template echoes, inevitable hindsight from jars-to-spelling arc.</comment>
