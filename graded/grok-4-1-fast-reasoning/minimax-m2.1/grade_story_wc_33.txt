<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority shines in "some rules deserved respectful rebellion," rooting rebellion in people-first traits with contradictory impulses (regs vs. humanity) acting in the smuggling micro-choice; Aram pressures as secondary crucible. Final endurance earned by prior deliveries, foreclosing safe neutrality with personal risk cost. Boy's nod reveals Marcus's values hierarchy without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via Elena's silences, Aram's package, vessel gift toward CR closure in mirror reflection and thunderstorm flicker reweighting borders as crossable, with undeniable risk cost legible in "brave people crossed anyway." Orientation anchored by ~100 words (mail route, arcade). Single scene, one tightening via boy's plea narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade's tinted glass and visible fence constrain neutral-ground choices, mirroring internal states (copper dusk to mirror); thunderstorm vessel as recurring micro-object charges final image. Sensory selective (last light fading pressures timing). Spatial choreography coherent amid arcade machines/counter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (border deliveries fostering connections) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Aram's tremble/no-money rejection of drones, forcing hand-smuggle agency that forecloses safety with felt risk cost ("drones that smuggle for a price"). One decisive deepening suffices; no reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of healing broken promises via absences emerges organically from sisters' silences, medicine, vessel; final CR image ("storms pass, even when they leave damage") reweights premise non-literally without moralizing. Aram's echo "linking what's missing" carries subtext, inviting reflection on borders' permeability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature ("borders...in the eyes of those who enforced them"); voice modulates rhythmically to brittle hush. Dialogue natural/subtextual (code phrase, drone fact) distinguishes Aram's plain idiom from Marcus's textured reflection. No head-hopping; elision minimal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "canvas bag weighed heavier...fragments of lives separated by lines") propels without loops; rhythm varies (short punchy boy exchange to flowing reflection). Metaphors coherent (trapped storm approves purpose); no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mailman smuggling metaphors (medicine, storm vessel) transforms disputed-territory trope via "linking absences" into healing premise. Thunderstorm bottle risks ingenuity without gimmick; closing reweighting feels inevitable from arcade neutral-ground setup.</comment>
