<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodiment in micro-choices like the wrong-buttoned coat and drone smile revealing rogue charm under pressure; motivation intensifies credibly to planting despite drone risk. Mild shortfall in shown contradictory impulses, mostly resolute without deep internal friction. Final guard stance earns endurance via prior resistance history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from garden entry to convergence planting as closure CR, with seed stirring and drone pass reconfiguring defiance. Orientation anchored early in Hollowfield Gardens; one tightening via overhead drone forecloses detection path with felt risk. Cost legible in "seed stirred... reaching downward," charging poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Selective details like kale spiral passwords and convergence junction constrain planting choice and charge final root image; sensory hierarchy (rustle, hum, warm seed) filters through scholar bias. Greenhouse mantises subtly pressure via flicker/watching. No white-room; lived-in choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (plant untaxable seed vs. detection) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to drone reversal narrowing options; agency in spiral trowel and loud deflection shows endurance. Cost felt in drone scan wave and implicit capture risk, charging final guard poise. No abstract stakes; viscerally on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of untaxable defiance emerges organically from plant codes and seed root seeking "rebellion water table"; final image reweights taxable world premise without moralizing. Subtext in "secrets worth dying for/living for" duality lingers ambiguously. No tidy resolution; complexity in hopeful yet risky stasis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "candidly cryptic" lens and biased noticing (furrows as sentences); rhythmic modulation builds lyric density without opacity. Stable close third-person; single spoken line natural/subtextual. Voice prose-as-character reflects rogue warmth under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "gourd rattle seed rested... warm from pocket" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion fits accumulative build. Minor metaphor density borders overwriting in insect/paperwork image but coherent; no loops touching closure. Slight scaffold in repeated "particular" phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thought-tax dystopia with garden cryptography and philosophical botany transforms tropes; gourd frequencies warping monitors inevitable from setup. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes; no derivative echoes, fully committed premise.</comment>
