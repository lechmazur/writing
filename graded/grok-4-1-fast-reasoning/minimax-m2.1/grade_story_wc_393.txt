<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in hesitation over mechanical vs. deeper repair, earned by chaplain's history; final inscription choice forecloses simple fix with personal transformation cost. Interiority concrete via embodied light perceptions and Marcus cue. No diagnostic labels flatten peaks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from flaw discovery to inscription realization; on-page closure via restored heart's music reconfigures restoration with intentional cost in "hidden blessing." Orientation anchored early in shop/prison life; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shop's west window light constrains repair angle and charges final motes/music image, mirroring internal states through shifting shafts. Sensory selection (ticking pulse, brass engravings) POV-biased via confessional analogy. Micro-setting walnut heart pivotal without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Internal stake of meaningful restoration tightens accumulatively via spring flaw to light-shaft epiphany, forcing inscription agency; cost legible in "repairer's own transformation." One deepening suffices, reweighting mechanical fix.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grace-as-action emerges via repair paralleling Marcus counsel, final music image resonantly reweights regrets without moral state. Particulars like fractured spring avoid platitudes; ambiguity in unseen inscription lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature in deliberate syntax/rhythm reflects chaplain's hush; light/heart diction biased to redemption lens. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual; no head-hopping or withhold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, no loops/scaffold; metaphors cohere (light souls, dropped coin) without muddle in peak repair beat. Minor light-reprise borders pattern but serves texture; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Chaplain-shop synthesis transforms redemption trope via clockwork grief; inscription turn inevitable from dual life particulars. Risks lyric hush payoff without gimmick.</comment>
