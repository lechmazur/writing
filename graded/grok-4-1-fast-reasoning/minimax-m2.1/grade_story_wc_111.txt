<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through embodied rituals like sap-stained hands and marble polishing; motivation rooted in stubborn patience yields earned stasis without high-stakes scene choice. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the present scene, limiting micro-choice depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing closure: villager's hesitation at maze entrance reconfigures gardens' knowing with conceptual cost of patience in life's cracks. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden maze as micro-setting constrains paths and revelations, charging final villager image; sensory details like sap stains and autumn decay selectively filter through gardener's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of patient preservation texturally accumulates via backstory deepening to present ritual, but lacks on-page tightening foreclosing a live option; villager arrival offers mild situational pressure without agency test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of gardens remembering emerges organically from particulars like mended vines and cracked marbles, resonant in final image reweighting effort/outcome without moralizing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor register elevation in "wisely pragmatic" repetitions edges toward label-speak without loop accumulation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of measurable luck via cracking marbles transforms trope of patient wisdom; garden memory premise risks vignette familiarity but earns ingenuity through deception payoff.</comment>
