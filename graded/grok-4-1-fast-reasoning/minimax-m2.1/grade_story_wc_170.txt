<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in centuries of patience, embodied via borrowed heartbeat syncing to melody; micro-choices like humming reveal values. No on-page contradictory impulses or genuine struggle, keeping it strong but short of exceptional. Final endurance of endless task feels earned but lacks visible internal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to song's deepening, mirrors rippling to final reconfiguration of their gaze. Charged Poise/CR closure lands on-page with conceptual cost (mirrors forever altered, her perpetual wandering). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via hush-before-bells suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism parapet droplets constrain her stillness and charge final image of gleaming promise tomorrow. Sensory details (wet earth, rainbows, birdsong) selective via her patient gaze, mirroring internal calm. Evolving environment (haze burning, bells echoing) integrates with action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken mirrors) signaled early; accumulative escalation via song's deepening, air shift, visions flickering narrows temporal options (hush before bells). Agency in her persuasion forecloses path with felt cost (heartbeat slows, task perpetuates). One decisive intensification suffices, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of gentle possibility-persuasion emerges organically from mirrors' visions vs. current decay, reweighting force with hope. Final shimmer and "never quite looked the same" offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Particulars (lullaby unlocking parallels) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature: patient, shimmering grace in noticing prisms and mirrors. Lyrical rhythm modulates from calm ascent to deepening hush, purposeful without opacity. No head-hopping or withholding; elision of her nature taught early, legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer sensory/atmospheric advance without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language (smoke through stone, dawn coaxing) purposeful and pattern-integrated, varying rhythm. Minor density in mid-descriptions but no muddle at peak song/visions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mirage painter persuades mirrors via coded lullabies into possibility-showers transforms supernatural trope organically. Risky lyric Accumulative drive heightens stakes of subtle persistence. Irreplaceable premise inflections (heartbeat sync, prism charge) feel inevitable.</comment>
