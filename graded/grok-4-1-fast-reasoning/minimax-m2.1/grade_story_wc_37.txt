<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional: Elara's fractured interiority ("shattered mirror reflecting pieces of ten thousand lives") embodies contradictory impulses, culminating in earned sacrifice ("becoming less scattered even as she became less whole") that forecloses personal wholeness for communal hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds seamlessly; ritual builds density to CR closure in shattering mica and dawn, with legible cost in Elara's self-dissolution ("pouring into the Heart-Tree like water into parched earth"). Orientation anchored immediately in greenhouse/world.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mica windows and Heart-Tree constrain choices (palm press triggers chant) and charge final image (shatter amplifies dawn); sensory details (phosphorescence, crystalline shards suspended) selectively mirror internal scattering without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle realm) signaled early, escalates via "something wrong" in bound release, forcing agency in final chant; density tightens to foreclose wholeness, cost unmistakable in "less whole" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial weaving emerges organically from particulars (memory-cloth, songs into light); final image ("bound to the light she had released and free") offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (fractured reflections, light refractions); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates intensity, consistent under stress in peak chant/shatter without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; figurative layering ("wounded heartbeat," "crystalline shards hung suspended") coherent and pattern-taught, though pervasive in peak risks minor overload—no loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirror-world alchemy and memory-sacrifice transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric CR (self into dawn-weaving) feels inevitable, heightening stakes via irreplaceable particulars like Heart-Tree binding.</comment>
