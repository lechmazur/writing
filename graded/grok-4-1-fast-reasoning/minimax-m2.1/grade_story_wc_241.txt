<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between academic caution and inherited risk-craving, embodied in subway photos and lantern delivery; final choice earned via prior causal build of scrawls' interpretation. Father's traits vivid through memory without dominating present. Minor abstraction in reflective blocks slightly distances peak hospital beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of reflections and images tightens to Charged Poise closure in hospital light-sharing, with emotional cost legible in "every bet... heard" silence. Two shards transition legibly via mental traverse; orientation anchored early in library. Cost proof: lantern pane flicker agrees with reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (wet stone/paper, mica glow) filter through Elara's math-biased perception; library and lantern as micro-settings constrain reflection then charge final image. Subway scrawls evolve causally from photos to interpretation. No environmental constraint slips pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciling probability/risk via scrawls interpretation deepens accumulatively to hospital crystallization, narrowing calcified grief path with relational cost. Agency in lantern delivery forecloses separation. Subtle escalation fits lens but lacks sharper on-page trade-off before closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of risk as life's "lucid contradiction" emerges organically from gambling math and scrawls ("HOUSE DOES NOT PLAY"); final lantern image offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting losses to meaning. No moralizing; ambiguity in "brave enough" lingers honestly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with math-perceptual signature (bell curves, expected value) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from reflective to charged hospital dialogue. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("I figured out what the scrawls mean"). No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful (e.g., "slow tears" windows) without muddle in closure. Minor overwriting in stacked images ("clover melancholy") slightly dulls peak hospital lines. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts touch ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief, probability, and subway scrawls as "invitations"; transforms gambling trope via math metaphors and lantern honesty. Risky reflective shards pay off in hindsight reconfiguration without gimmickry.</comment>
