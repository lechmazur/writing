<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied shadows and micro-choices like holding the crystal steady; courageous anomaly drives distinction without labels dominating action. Final choice to use fragments earned by layered selves in mirror, foreclosing wholeness with felt cost of carrying shadows.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to Charged Poise closure; crystal swing in final mirror beat reconfigures mission with conceptual cost of fragmented sight over repair. Orientation anchored early in orchard and ice; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via orchard soil enabling apple trade and crystal pointing to ice; recurrent light on floes charges final softening image. Sensory selectivity (groaning ice, copper smell) mirrors intuitive calm without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of empathetic understanding tightens through merging faces to expectant gaze, forcing trade-off in crystal use; agency in rising to mirror narrows to action over stasis. Cost legible in exhaled purpose toward struggling ships.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of peace via shadowed understanding emerges from mirror layers and fragment faces; final image reweights premise non-literally as orchard bends for passage. No moralizing, ambiguity in what fractures linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias (light fragments as faces) stable in close third; syntax modulates from descriptive to propulsive in crystal-pointing beat. Minimal dialogue natural; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (veins through marble) taught early, no loops or scaffold; rhythm varies to peak propulsion in "weighted breath" exhale. Closure image clear, no artifacts dulling it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of liminal orchard-store on ice transforms peacekeeper trope via intuitive fragments; risk in magical realism (store materializes) heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration inevitable from layered mirrors.</comment>
