<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's eye for "stories hidden within objects" drives consistent micro-choices like approaching the scratched mailbox; internal conflict subtle in curiosity vs. passivity resolved via earned realization. Mrs. Okonkwo applies targeted pressure through tea-sharing. Final proof to herself feels motivated but edges toward epiphanic summary in "she understood finally why."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layers build from mailbox scratches to locket photo to letters' reading, yielding CR closure in estranged sister's tears and Elena's reconfiguration. Orientation anchored early (courtyard, curator at dawn). Cost legible in "wounds no medicine could reach" and empty mailbox vigil's end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Courtyard's "worn stone tiles" and "dawn-chilled stones" tactilely constrain Elena's soft footsteps and bench-sitting; recurring "sandstorm calm" charges final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (light changing, brass glinting). Mailbox as micro-setting guides discovery without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unraveling objects' hidden stories) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Mrs. Okonkwo's tale and letters' contents, narrowing to Elena's stance on curation. Agency in "following curiosity" and listening forecloses passive routine with relational cost (sixty-year rift healed). Truck rumble complicates calm intrusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory curation via witness emerges from locket/letters particulars, reweighted in "discarded objects carried the most valuable cargo"; final image (empty mailbox, ongoing dawn calm) answers non-literally. No moralizing; ambiguity in "stories needed to be heard before they could be released."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("eye for the stories hidden within objects") stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from quiet observation to revelatory spread. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in Mrs. Okonkwo's "low tones." No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dense propulsion with varied rhythm; minor paraphrase loops in "stillness" motifs purposeful for tone. Slight figurative density ("sandstorm calm," "breadcrumbs") in opening but taught/paid off without muddle. Clean syntax, no scaffold in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: thrift curator unlocks generational rift via jammed mailbox/letters, transforming "lost & found" trope through quiet witness. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes; locket reprise inevitable in hindsight. No template echoes.</comment>
