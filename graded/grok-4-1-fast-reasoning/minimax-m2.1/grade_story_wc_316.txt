<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between numbness and latent desire for feeling culminates in earned blade-touch choice with embodied gasp pulling through numbness. Clone's warmth contrasts protagonist's hollow traits, forcing relational crucible. Minor diagnostic slips like "emotional numbness" slightly abstract embodiment pre-climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflection and confrontation builds to on-page CR closure—"numbness remained, but it was no longer absolute"—with legible cost in cracked but persistent void. Single scene anchored early (floating rock dojo by para 1). No orientation debt; blade act reconfigures options without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo and upward-falling leaves vividly constrain pretense-slicing ethos, charging final "settled into a new era" image. Sensory selection (autumn twilight, etched stones) mirrors internal dissolution selectively via POV bias. Dojo subtly guides blade confrontation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeat numbness) tightens accumulatively via blade "vivify," narrowing violence to connection with protagonist agency. Clone dialogue complicates opposition; cost felt in gasp and residual numbness. One decisive deepening suffices, charging closure under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation via complementary opposites emerges organically from blade act and final duo-realization, reweighting original/copy binary. Resonant non-literal answer in sheathing blade image avoids moralizing. Minor echo in "complementary opposites" line borders thesis articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (scoured numbness vs. clone's warmth) with rhythmic modulation under stress. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("You want to feel again") pursues goals distinctly. Elevated diction fits philosophical voice without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels to closure; no loops or artifacts dull blade gasp peak. Minor overwriting in early reflections (e.g., "dissolved into everything and nothing") but weaves into action. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with realization cadence.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ego death, clone custody, and pretense blade in dojo transforms sci-fi tropes via specific opposites realization. Risky CR closure feels inevitable from setup. Bold history-rewriting frame heightens stakes organically.</comment>
