<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Defiant artist's motivation rooted in past surrenders compels higher-stakes poetry with children; contradictory impulses (prior belonging vs. now freedom) act in scene, earning final stance with self-forgiveness cost. Interiority concrete via "heart hammered like something wanting escape."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: writing seeds truths, echoes/mist/children densify pattern to cadence shift; on-page RR closure ("truth had already been refracted... no pale spire... could call it back") with conceptual cost of defied silence. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bone towers, mist, echoes selectively vivid and purposeful, constraining choices (carry/multiply words) and charging final image (canyon "thick with truths"); sensory hierarchy reflects Sera's priorities, mirroring internal defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (disrupt ritual via truth-refraction) signaled early, escalates accumulatively from solo writing to children's chorus under lens; agency in poetry forces priests' arrival, foreclosing silence with felt social cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. enforced silence emerges organically from particulars (poems about mothers, multiplying voices); final image offers resonant non-literal answer ("hundred small voices") reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (poetic noticing of cracks/doorways); dialogue natural/subtextual ("I'm un-making"), distinct from child's simplicity; rhythmic control modulates with rising density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful lyric metaphors integrated into action (mist "curl like breath held too long"); minor overwriting in opening figurative cluster but pattern-taught, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bone-tower world, truth-as-art defiance, and child-chorus refraction transforms rebellion trope; risk of poetic multiplicity heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via echoes/mist.</comment>
