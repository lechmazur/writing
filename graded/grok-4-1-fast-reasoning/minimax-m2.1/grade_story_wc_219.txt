<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract and diagnostic ("luminous skepticism, once a barrier, now served as a lantern"), with epiphanies told via summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene; no micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via image density (tower, path, amber) holds to CR closure ("homecoming... was not arrival but recognition"); cost legible in transformed skepticism and joined footprints; orientation anchored by para 2, one deepening via amber lift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tower and path constrain pilgrimage choice (winding ascent, descent joining prints); selective sensory details (rain-patter, bronze quiet, metallic tones) evolve with light/rain, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism; micro-setting (pedestal, amber) charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (comprehend homecoming chemistry) signaled para 1, deepens accumulatively via amber realization narrowing skepticism to wonder; agency in pilgrimage/handling forecloses prior certainties with felt cost (irreversible transformation); no reversal needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of pilgrimage/homecoming emerges organically from amber-fly parallel, alien cosmic scale, and footprints without direct statement; final CR reweights "artificial pilgrimage had become genuine" resonantly; minor drift to platitude ("journey itself constituted the destination").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (scientific lens on "chemistry," erosion as persistence); rhythm modulates from measured ascent to deepening quiet; purposeful compression of reflection legible under accumulative lens, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in reflections ("artificial pilgrimage" x4 variants, "homecoming" churn across final third) dull closure image (−0.8); dense figuration ("frozen river," "dust motes like spirits") purposeful but overwrites meditative peak; strong propulsion otherwise, varied rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of first-contact skepticism with amber-fly as universal pilgrimage emblem transforms tropes via cosmic/biological parallel; risk in lyric reflection heightens thematic gravity without gimmick; irreplaceable final convergence image inevitable from setup.</comment>
