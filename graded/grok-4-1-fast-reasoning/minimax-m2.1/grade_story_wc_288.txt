<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied in "heart, that organ which had beaten through ten thousand years," driving shift from grief to honoring ancestors; contradictory grief/pain acts in fragile awakenings, earning final wade with cost of prior isolation. Micro-choices reveal values hierarchy. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via rising tides/memories to CR closure in "book...map of what might yet be born," reweighting extinction with conceptual cost legible in final chorus hum. Orientation anchored early; one tightening at peak tides suffices. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tidal library, brass sundial constrain choices—shadow points stacks, water to knees forces wade—charging final image; sensory hierarchy POV-filtered (bare feet on marble, ink swirling). Recurrent tides/hum evolve causally, mirroring internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief/isolation) signaled early, deepens via fractured reflection/new volume under textural lens, narrowing to connection with felt cost in "burden...last witness." Agency in stance crystallization; one tightening forecloses mourning path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (extinction=transformation, isolation=connection) emerges organically from particulars—ghosts to ancestors, book as map—resonating in final non-literal image of hum "singing...in welcome" without moralizing; reweights premise obliquely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (extinct species memories) stable in third-limited; rhythmic control modulates from brittle pain to charged poise, prose as character in syntax reflecting soul-dawnings. No head-hopping; elision purposeful/lyric-taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short crystalline images amid flow), propulsion weaves sensory/prose tightly—no overwriting muddle, metaphors coherent (ink as marine life). Closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reincarnation grief/tidal knowledge-library transforms extinction tropes via atomic sundial/time-fracture; bold lyric risk (floating library, species ghosts) inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
