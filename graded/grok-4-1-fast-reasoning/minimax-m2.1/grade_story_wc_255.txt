<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's colorblindness concretely shapes her micro-choices in arrangements and gift-giving, earning the apprentice's awakening with visible cost of relinquishing the reed tongue. Apprentice's curiosity applies immediate pressure, revealing character through deciphering. Minor telling in "gift and her burden" but embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from accidental leaves to deliberate spiral/rose signaling the apprentice, culminating in Charged Poise RR as he kneels to learn the language. Orientation anchored early in courtyard entry. Closure cost legible in reed handover reconfiguring awakening passage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Discarded glass shards and oak leaves constrain choices, integrated into arrangements that charge the final glass-plant hybrid image. Sensory hierarchy via Mira's textured perception narrows to imperfections. Courtyard evolves with sun rising, mirroring awakening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of communicating beauty tightens accumulatively when apprentice deciphers spiral, forcing reed gift with felt cost of parting with treasured past. Agency in Mira's deliberate patterns narrows options. Glassblower's observation adds subtle pressure without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of bartered awakening in imperfection emerges organically via arrangements and reed, final image of spreading "quiet revolution" offering resonant CR reweighting perfection's insistence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in light/shadow shifts; voice texture poetic yet biased to Mira's texture-form seeing. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You're speaking to me"), advances plot. Rhythmic control modulates from descriptive to charged end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm; minor overwriting in metaphors like "understanding blooming...first color" slightly muddies peak but pattern-taught. No loops, strong verbs propel to final image. Varied syntax supports accumulative build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of colorblind painter's plant-glass language transforms imperfection trope, with reed tongue as non-obvious awakening conduit. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically to revolutionary close.</comment>
