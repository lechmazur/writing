<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between ambition and stillness act in tending beats; final reconfiguration of ambition earned via sustained endurance of scent repulsion, with olfactorily sensitive nose as pivotal trait transforming from burden to gift at bloom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure at bloom ("not decaying... transforming"), reweighting premise; cost legible in endured aversion and reorganized ambition; orientation anchored early in climb to Mosshaven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details (scents as "undercurrent," elderflower sap ghost) selectively constrain choices via nose; recurring hanging gardens/greenhouse charge final pollen harvest; treetop boards "pulse" mirrors internal hush, POV-filtered perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (serenity in tending repulsion) signaled by Sholomi's task; textural escalation via journal doodles mapping aversion to breakthrough; agency in breathing through/ harvesting forecloses push-for-recognition path with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of endured wisdom emerges via scent transformation mirroring ambition shift; final doodle ("wildflower from spiral") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting "patience blooms in strange soil" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with olfactory perceptual signature biasing details (e.g., "whispers of something deeper"); lyrical rhythm modulates from anticipatory hush to serene bloom; Sholomi dialogue sparse, subtextual, voice-distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., unwrapping embeds family custom and motive); rhythmic variety peaks at bloom without figurative muddle; no loops, precise syntax propels to charged final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of olfactory training, corpse flower transformation, and doodle-mapping embeds ambition's textual arc organically; risk in lyric accumulation pays off at CR closure without gimmickry.</comment>
