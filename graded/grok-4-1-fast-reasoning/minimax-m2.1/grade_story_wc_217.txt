<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poet's warmly attentive hands and patient tending reveal consistent traits driving higher-stakes micro-choices, like harmonizing feather and kite despite mismatch; internal conflict in embracing incompleteness acts simultaneously in scene without summaries. Final renunciation of full resolution feels earned via prior causality, with embodied cost in "truth too heavy to speak aloud." Contradictory impulses and visible cost satisfy 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from feather discovery to bird's trust and flight, culminating in Charged Poise CR where incompleteness reconfigures meaning ("small fire that needed no fuel but its own incompleteness"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; cost legible in final tucked feather and carried "woven dawns." Persistent constraint of missing string shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Slick stones, cobalt lagoon, and washed-up kite frame constrain choices, mirroring internal fractures; recurring root perch grounds bird's observation. Sensory hierarchy (iridescent shifts, dripping hush) reflects poet's priorities, evolving with action to charge reflection in still surface. Lagoon after rain pressures tending via slickness and remnants; final image recharged by weather-washed morning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in incomplete) signaled early, tightens via bird's trust and clumsy flight under Accumulative lens, narrowing to renunciation of completion. One deepening (kite-injury link) forecloses tidy harmony with felt cost in string's absence, charging poise. Agency in tending/endurance drives escalation without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unfinished beauty emerges from particulars (feather-kite mend, bird's arc) without statement; final image ("kite without a string can still gesture") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise. Subtext in "seams visible" embraces ambiguity; no moralizing, counter-readings plausible in incompleteness' invitation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (barbs as "small miracle," light as "messy... purples and grays"); rhythmic control modulates from hush to scattering droplets under pressure. Lyrical compression taught early, paid in closure image; diction biased to poet's noticing, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "iridescence shifted... each barb a small miracle" advances setting/character/theme); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful in lyric pattern, no muddle in peak (bird's flight); propulsion breathes with scene, zero artifacts at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poet-bird-kite into incompleteness' fire transforms healing trope; risk in lyric non-resolution heightens stakes via conceptual cost. Non-obvious angle on becoming feels inevitable from feather's gleam to tucked pocket; bold voice commits without retreat.</comment>
