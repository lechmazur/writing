<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions ("words had tangled in her throat like loosened strings") compelling the direct apology; flaws (fear as cruelty avoidance) drive the earned renunciation of silence. Final choice forecloses estrangement path with relational cost on the page. Contradictory impulses act in the hesitation before speaking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to Charged Poise closure: apology lands with fading currents and tree-fall image reconfiguring silence as potential growth ("just in time to begin again"). Orientation anchored early (orchard edge, library basement by ~100 words). One tightening via connection stutter narrows options before legible cost in imperfect miracle's end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recurring perfume bottle and orchard chainsaw cough constrain time/tactics, charging final image (pocketed bottle amid falling trees). Sensory hierarchy (smell of empty bottle, static voice, dim light) filters through Eleanor's priorities. Micro-setting (faded folders, incomplete symphony) mirrors internal damage without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology before disconnection) signaled early tightens accumulatively via Margot's rebuke and fading currents, forcing direct speech over riddles. Agency in descent and raw apology forecloses evasion with felt cost (stuttering end, carried ache). Escalation driven by live chainsaws during dialogue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect repair emerges organically from particulars (unfinished symphony, pruned life, tree-fall as beginning), reweighting metaphors vs. direct truth in resonant final image without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications (Margot's perfume retention) invites ambiguity on belonging's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (metaphorical departures, circled wounds); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("You always spoke in riddles"). Rhythmic modulation peaks in terse apology lines; purposeful compression in fading enhances pressure without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "stones dropping into still water"); varied rhythm supports ear test. Minor overwriting in reflective metaphors ("fleeting contacts, stuttering connections") slightly dulls one mid-beat but spares closure. No loops or scaffolds; strong verbs dominate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exorcist-gossiper with archival ghosts and orchard doom transforms tropes (ghost reunion) via specific metaphors-as-work and tree-fall reconfiguration. Risky ethereal grit commits fully, heightening stakes organically; no derivative echoes.</comment>
