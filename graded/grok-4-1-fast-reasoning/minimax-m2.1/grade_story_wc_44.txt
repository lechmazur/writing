<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and scholar-specific, with embodied shiver at key discovery and warm grip during circles compelling higher-stakes ritual; final knowledge "settled into her bones" earns change via prior micro-choices. Minor lack of contradictory impulses under pressure keeps from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as discovery (key) densities to ritual loops closing with clicks, yielding CR closure: shadow unfolds as folded light with effort cost in seven circles. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating isle and observatory window constrain choice (tracing shadow) and charge final image of completed noontime shadow; sensory hum of stones and starlight integrate purposefully through rune-biased POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shadows at noon) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via key find and loop closures narrowing to revelation; agency in deliberate circling forecloses prior theoretical limits with felt physical/mental cost, legible in unraveling shadow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of practice over theory emerges organically from relearning via loops, resonant CR in "shadows... trapped in the curvature" reweighting Bend premise without moralizing; final image answers central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (shifting runes, gear pulses) biased to scholar's eye; rhythmic prose modulates from quiet observation to intensifying clicks, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax (e.g., "one loop becoming two"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; minor elevated diction in "phosphorescent fish" fits voice but risks slight drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Bend (spoons curving reality) into shadow-as-folded-light premise, transformed via rune ritual; risk-taking in solo accumulative discovery heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
