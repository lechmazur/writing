<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to collect fragments compels consistent micro-choices like reassembling letters, with interior contradiction in recognizing narrative patterns versus simple truth-seeking. Orchard keeper applies targeted pressure via diamond reveal. Minor slip: embodied emotion in discovery leans toward summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building through letter reconstruction to Conceptual Repricing closure; final orchard image reconfigures truth as stillpoint with legible conceptual cost of orbiting lies. Orientation anchored early at tree perimeter. One meaningful deepening via diamond's crystalline data ties fragments cohesively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard's skeletal village versus thriving canopy constrains Mira's safehouse and charges final dust storm image, mirroring internal paradox. Radiation-mapped skin and clinking satchel filter through POV urgency. Sensory hierarchy selective to decay/thrival tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth excavation signaled early tightens accumulatively via controlled release discovery, narrowing to transmission with felt cost of persistent myths. Agency in patient reconstruction forecloses easy narratives. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth as stillpoint emerges organically from orchard/diamond particulars, final image offering resonant reconfiguration without moralizing—"the stillpoint around which all the lies began to orbit."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "intuiting patterns beneath narratives"; keeper's dialogue subtext-laden and idiomatic. Voice modulates rhythmically with discovery intensity, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with lines doubling action/atmosphere, e.g., "archaeological rhythm of reconstruction"; rhythm varies without loops. Minor elevated diction in "metastasized" fits lexicon but borders register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Diamond as crystalline data record transforms conspiracy trope ingeniously, with stillpoint synthesis feeling inevitable from wasteland paradox; risk in mythic subversion heightens stakes organically.</comment>
