<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete sensitivity to "spaces between memory and silence," embodied in diary retrieval and negative use; earned change from isolation to connection mirrors Ashworth's burden in final sketch. Minor lack of shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously slightly tempers from peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through density buildup (grandmother's tools → diaries → diagram); CR closure reconfigures legacy with emotional cost legible in "for the first time in years, she did not feel alone," anchoring before/after without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled setting and damp ruins constrain tools ("modern methods failed"), charging final image where "ivy's whispers joining the chorus"; sensory selectivity (crackle of centuries, breath clouding) reflects Mira's perceptual bias flawlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart echoes before dissolution) deepens via diary discoveries reweighting burden; one tightening (glimpsing Ashworth's chart) forces emotional trade-off, but subtle internal pressure lacks visceral live option foreclosure for 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of walls dreaming people emerges organically from particulars (Ashworth's question → Mira's sketch); final reconfiguration answers without moralizing, reweighting "burden" as "thread" with lingering ambiguity on future passing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with distinct perceptual signature ("building dreamed," whispers in Latin); rhythmic modulation heightens texture under discovery pressure, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels accumulative beats; figurative layering (ivy as "audience," walls "breathe") purposeful without muddle, though minor density risks overwriting in opening—closure image pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-climate cartography transforms ruin tropes via echo-mapping; bold perceptual frame and CR payoff feel inevitable, risking poetic conceit that heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
