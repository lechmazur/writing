<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature via "architecture of emotion" and face-blind aperture reveals character under pressure; methodical micro-choices like arranging pigments align with motives rooted in mother's loss. Final portrait emerges as earned endurance of grief into completion. Minor slip in over-articulated diagnostic phrasing ("emotional sediment") lacks full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from ribbon feel to portrait convergence; single scene anchors who/where/when immediately. Closure as Charged Poise in "mist...exhaling" reconfigures loss into peace with felt cost of unresolved evidence. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quarry's "fog rolled across stone faces" and thinning mist constrain painting ritual and charge final image as atmospheric exhale mirroring emotional release. Sensory hierarchy POV-filtered through artist's geometry of emotion. Recurring fog subtly guides choices without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unify opposites awakens empathy signaled early; tightening in painting beat narrows fear to visibility via ribbon pressure. Accumulative escalation through perceptual density forces stance crystallization. Cost legible in "not justice, but peace" foreclosing evidentiary path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of opposites (terror/triumph) emerges organically via portrait method, resonating in final "hunger to be seen" without moralizing. Subtext in ribbon's "residue" and quarry silence invites ambiguity on completion vs. justice. Protagonist arc inextricable from unifying visible/invisible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual bias ("subtle geometry of inner landscape"); diction/rhythm modulate from methodical setup to lyrical convergence. No head-hopping or elision; perceptual signature controls under painting pressure. Elevated register fits artist's voice consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering ("ribbon...like preserved skin"); rhythm varies for propulsion in painting sequence. Minor overwrite in repeated "swallowed" (fog/time) creates subtle loop, but no closure harm. Clean syntax, no artifacts dulling final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Face-blind artist's emotional portraits transform cold-case trope via "unifying opposites" premise, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Bold synthesis of neurology/aperture charges closure uniquely. Risk in lyric texture heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
