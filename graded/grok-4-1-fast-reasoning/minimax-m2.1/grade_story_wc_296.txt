<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied shame ("weight lift from his chest") contradicting hubris, compelling the seed-planting renunciation; final acceptance earned through micro-choices like unbending posture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: expanding circles accumulate to ice shatter and seed growth, delivering CR closure in pool reflection with reputation cost legible ("had not saved his reputation").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory anchors (moss-slick rocks, refracted rainbows) constrain bare-footed counter-motion and charge final still pool image mirroring internal renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmake failure/curse) tightens via ice-crack reversal and seed planting under accumulative lens, with agency foreclosing shame path; stakes slightly abstract until plant shoot payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of failure-to-growth emerges organically from ice-to-mist and seed-to-shoot images, resonant CR in pool realization reweighting mirrors' illusion without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with druidic perceptual bias (magical geography focus); rhythmic modulation peaks in circle steps, distinct texture without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in ice-crack thunder; purposeful repetition ("countless") accumulates texturally without loops, minor elevated diction fits voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of druidic hubris redemption via corpse-seed cannibalizes tropes; warlike serenity risks lyrical fantasy payoff in plant growth without gimmickry.</comment>
