<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's sharp eyes and perpetual surprise trait drive concrete perceptions like tracing letters and catching tool marks, revealing character under pressure. Interiority particularizes motivation for belonging through embodied wonder, culminating in earned realization she's the missing piece. Childhood trait anchors without excess reflection, tilting present choices like climbing the stair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from trail-following cues to machine activation, delivering on-page Conceptual Repricing where the map reconfigures her search as illusory with conceptual cost of unrecognized home. Orientation anchors early via salt flats and scratched sentence. Single scene coheres with one tightening via stellar cipher understanding; cost legible in "She had been the missing piece all along."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory details like tarnished brass, copper dome, and obsidian floor constrain actions (spiral stair climb, lever pull) and charge final image of embracing glow under wheeling stars. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's priorities: fading sunlight on tool marks narrows to star trails. Setting evolves causally with twilight deepening stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode belonging via chip) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through cipher realization and lever pull, forcing renunciation of external search. Agency in pulling lever amid generational resistance forecloses prior disconnection path with felt cost in reflective map. Pressure coheres under Textural lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Belonging theme emerges from particulars like pilgrim's trails, star language, and map's branching paths, reweighted non-literally in final image: frequency "already woven through every star trail and every human heartbeat." No moralizing; resonance from her surprise catching hidden truths charges closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in surprised discoveries ("always catching the world in the act"). Prose texture modulates rhythm from exploratory to rhythmic heartbeat gears. No dialogue; diction purposeful, reflecting Mira's wonder without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, interiority without loops; rhythm varies with scene propulsion, peaking in "Gears turned. Dies descended... with the precise rhythm of a heartbeat." Minor overwriting in "brilliant and dim at once" motif stays voice-consistent, no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stars-as-language printing press premise synthesizes fresh celestial cipher with type foundry key, transforming pilgrimage trope via specific stellar mechanics. Risky "brilliant dimness" tone heightens closure stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight: pilgrim's sentence seeds map's reconfiguration.</comment>
