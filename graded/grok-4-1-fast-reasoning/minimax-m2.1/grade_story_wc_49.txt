<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in generational inheritance compels micro-choices like positioning the vine; interiority concrete via goggles and worn tools. Minor slip: no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but endurance to restoration earned with embodied weeping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to on-page bloom; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly in final image of luminous leaves pulsing, reweighting dormancy with felt generational cost ("after so long in darkness"). Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Verdant arbor's ancient stone bed constrains vine placement for sun rays, charging final blooming image; sensory details (amber mist, thickened air) selective via reverent POV. No white-room; micro-setting (soil untouched by plow/poison) mirrors sacred stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken vine/restore practices) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via hush, golden threads, full transformation narrowing dormancy opposition. Agency in song drives decisive intensification; cost legible in patient wait foreclosed by bloom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of lost knowledge restored emerges implicitly through vine's story-spinning threads and final "one garden at a time"; resonant non-literal answer reweights cycles without moralizing. Particulars like genetic memory avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (tinkerer's reverence for "golden stories," tools clicking); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to pulsing leaves. Lyrical diction consistent, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varying rhythm (short hush sentences to flowing song); purposeful figuratives ("spun sunlight") cohere without muddle. Minor repetition of "grandmother/old" purposeful for lineage, no loops dulling closure bloom.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer eco-mysticism with DNA "genetic memory" and plant-spun stories transforms tropes; final arbor bloom feels inevitable from alignment premise. Bold spiritual risk heightens stakes organically.</comment>
