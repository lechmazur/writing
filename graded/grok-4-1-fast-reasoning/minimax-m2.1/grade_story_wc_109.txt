<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Oracle's motivation to map darkness roots in consistent obsession and training, compelling her final drawing; interiority concrete via stone-reading memories anchored to present vigils. Mild internal endurance of silence versus storm pressure shows embodied certainty without epiphanies. Flawless alignment of actions to traits earns closure peace, but lacks sharp contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences/vigils builds to Conceptual Repricing closure where drawn map reconfigures darkness as inhabitable, with legible conceptual cost in her death ("eyes closed as the last light faded"). Single scene fits defaults; orientation anchored early (parapet, storm, star). No slips touch ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ridge fort and storm constrain vigils/drawing (storm pauses for "marbled hush," fort "holds"); pebble shores recur tactilely via booklet/stones, charging final peace image. Sensory hierarchy (hushed wind/stone over visual fury) biases through oracle's perceptual limits. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal topology of shadow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map darkness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via storm pause/star flicker narrowing to final drawing; agency in patient hand despite trembling. Cost unmistakable in foreclosed life/light ("last star flickered," eyes close). One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of truths in absence emerges organically from pebble arrangements/map of shadow, reweighted non-literally in ending ("inhabit, like pebbles...still beneath waves"). No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in silence speaking. Final image resonates without assertion, tying internal arc to conceptual endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature obsessed with absences ("spaces between marks"); rhythmic modulation heightens hush under pressure. Compression of vigils taught early, paid in drawing. Diction biases to stone/silence idiom consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (e.g., "charcoal stick...topology of shadow"); purposeful "hush"/silence pattern avoids loops. Minor scaffold in reflective stems ("weight of every silence"), but rhythm varies for propulsion. No muddle in peak drawing beat; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mapping endless night via silence/stones transforms oracle trope into inevitable conceptual endurance. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry; no derivative echoes. Bold voice commits to premise fully.</comment>
