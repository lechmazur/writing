<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via bloodhound senses and tactile reading, with motivation rooted in brother's leaf and prior failed attempts; earned realization forecloses futile searching with emotional cost in final hold of leaf and cylinder. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, limiting 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building density to CR closure ("the riddle... resolved itself not as a puzzle... but a door that opened"); cost legible in "translating distance into closeness" realization amid wasteland hush. Orientation anchored early in scrapyard search; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Scrapyard "metal labyrinth" and "cracked earth" constrain search and charge final image ("sat among the twisted metal"), with sensory bias (scents, textures) reflecting POV expertise. Environment mirrors internal revelation without overt symbolism.</comment>
