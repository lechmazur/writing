<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied traits like ripple-mark skin and vibrational sensitivity root motivation and enable micro-choices; final rest earned through training's competence, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from crack-reading to bloom invitation; closure as Charged Poise (silence expansion) lands on-page with felt cost of accumulated noise release, stone's purpose reconfigured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen pool cracks and harmonic caves constrain discovery (spiral as hush sign); body tingles and stone charge final image; sensory hierarchy (vibrational over visual) reflects mapkeeper bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush refuge) signaled early, tightens via spiral spotting and stone sync narrowing to invocation; agency in tone-breath forecloses chaos with legible cellular wash of noise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of quiet forged from chaos emerges via stone's shift from amplifier to silencer; final nothing-song image resonantly reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (vibrational currents as "stone's song"); rhythmic modulation builds to repose, diction sensory-biased and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., crack-tracing advances plot/character/setting); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful metaphors enhance without muddling peak invocation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frequency beings, hush physics, and mapkeeper craft; risk in lyric accumulative hush-creation feels inevitable, transforming tropes via world-logic payoff.</comment>
