<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied hollow in chest and shell's warmth; contradictory fear vs. necessity acts in steps against judgment and rising from stone. Minor slip: epiphany on "offerings" borders diagnostic self-awareness without full embodied cost in peak weep moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via visions to pattern break in solemnization, landing Charged Poise RR at "ready to write" with felt cost of years lost in "first time in years." Orientation anchors early; one tightening via ghosts suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory weave (mist weaving, emerald moss) mirrors internal thinning; shell as micro-setting constrains reflection and charges spiral final image, guiding liminal choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creative hollow/fear) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via visions forcing acknowledgment; agency in coming/sitting/solemnizing forecloses doubt-path with emotional weep cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of unfinished hopes as brave offerings emerges via visions/particulars; final spiral image resonantly reweights without literal moral. Minor Thematic Echo in "different way of hoping" line softens peak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in literary noticing of "shapes" and potentials; rhythmic modulation builds hush to charged release, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (mist, current) taught early; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor template cadence in adjacent "each one a different shape" phrasing near visions deducts without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghosts of abandoned characters at feral nexus transform writer's block trope via specific hopes/gallery image; risk of lyric visions heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
