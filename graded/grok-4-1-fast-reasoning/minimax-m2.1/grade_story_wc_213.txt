<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and embodied anticipation in repair and pause before switch; micro-choices reveal values without deep contradiction, limiting 9+; earned alignment as part of larger system shows credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from sensors to anomaly; on-page closure as Charged Poise in "zero hour, precisely as predicted" reconfigures hush with felt temporal cost; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via glue cure and wind exposure on sensors; recurring sanctuary/rope charges final image; sensory hierarchy (pressure on eardrums, air tremble) POV-specific and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (test before storm) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via "air had begun to tremble"; agency in switch throw forecloses delay with legible anticipation cost; subtle for high pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of listening/silence to warning emerges organically from rope reflection and siren as "prayer"; final image resonant reweight of hush to rain without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in meteorological poetics ("air itself whispered"); rhythmic modulation builds to siren crescendo; no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops; minor figurative density ("siren rose like a dawn") purposeful without muddle; propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of monastic past and modern meteorology in solstice hush-to-siren arc; risk in quiet lyricism heightens stakes organically.</comment>
