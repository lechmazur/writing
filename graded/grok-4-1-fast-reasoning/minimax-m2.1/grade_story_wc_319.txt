<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in consistent vigil traits intensifies to compel the final walk, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for deeper interior conflict. The transformation from homesick waiting to movement feels earned by prior causality without unearned epiphanies. Minor slip in embodied contradictions lowers from higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase from pendant arrival to interiorizing, culminating in Charged Poise closure where mist parting reconfigures waiting as movement with felt cost of ending paralysis. Orientation anchored early in guardian/garden/mist. Single scene coherent; cost legible in "stop waiting and simply walk forward."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist and frozen garden vividly selective (shifting like breath), filter through POV's marginal gaze, constrain perception and charge final parting image that enables walk. Sensory hierarchy matches contemplative urgency; setting mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism. Environment shapes closure tactics perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of dimensional homesickness signals early, tightens via one deepening (interiorizing pendant reweights garden as threshold), narrowing paralysis options under Accumulative lens. Agency in pressing/tucking pendant forecloses waiting with felt emotional cost. Escalation coheres without need for reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of befriending uncertainty emerges organically from mist/pendant/garden images, with final walk offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting homesickness as welcome. Complexity lingers in ambiguity without moralizing; protagonist arc inextricable from question. No thematic echo or platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (margins/veils), rhythmic control modulates from foggy density to lucid clarity under pressure of transformation. Prose texture as character: syntax reflects feral introspection. No head-hopping or withholding; purposeful lyric compression taught early, paid in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops in "not a prison but..." repetition and figurative density in peak interiorizing beat dull slight momentum without obscuring closure. Rhythm varies read-aloud; no major artifacts or scaffold. Specific diction replaces generics effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of feral guardian trope with dimensional homesick ache and foggy lucidity transforms into inevitable becoming; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration grows from particulars; no derivative echoes.</comment>
