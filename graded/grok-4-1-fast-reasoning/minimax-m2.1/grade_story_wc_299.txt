<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene—facts steady him while cloth evokes longing—and final drive to Elko is earned by interleaved past/present pressures with visible cost in confronting grief. Interiority concrete via thumb on joints and cloth texture; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density builds to Charged Poise closure in "He would drive to Elko tomorrow," reconfiguring isolation vs. history with undeniable emotional cost felt in "echo valley longing." Orientation anchored early in trailer appraisal; one tightening via phone message narrows options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Trailer's thin walls and howling wind constrain isolation, mirroring internal echo and charging final amplifier choice; cloth as micro-setting handled tactilely. Sensory details (smoke machine scent, dovetail joints) selective and POV-biased toward appraisal expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake of purpose after loss signaled early, tightens accumulatively via message that forces trade-off between fact-insulation and history-confrontation; cost legible in foreclosed stasis of trailer life. Agency in phone toggle and decision crystallizes under coherent internal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sound's persistent echo emerges organically from cloth, amplifier, and trailer wind, reweighted non-literally in final image of purpose surviving artifacts. Complexity embraced via confidently uncertain stance without tidy moral; resonance from particulars like hand-scribed note.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature—antiques facts vs. venue roars—modulates rhythmically under stress; syntax reflects fragmented mind in phone toggle beat. No head-hopping; purposeful compression of reflections pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful "echo" recurrence builds texture without loops. No scaffold or muddled metaphors in peak message beat; propulsion clear in escalating sensory anchors like cloth press.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Roadie-to-appraiser synthesis transforms grief tropes via specific amplifier callback and fact-insulation; fresh angle on loss via "sound never truly disappears" feels inevitable. Risk in reflective density heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
