<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Embodied professionalism shines in precise equipment checks and pocket grain's felt weight; interiority concrete via obsessive timing. Minor weakness: minimal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, mostly serene competence without struggle-driven flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly; CR closure via final grain image reweights witnessing with frost-loss cost, legible in "the frost would not." One tightening via chronometer countdown narrows options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Summit regolith marks and earthlight constrain precise movements; recurring camera/chemical chamber charges final dawn exposure. Frost sublimation mirrors internal loss, POV-filtered through inspector's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture vanishing frost) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via countdown density to Charged Poise endurance. Cost felt in "melancholy truth" acceptance foreclosing permanence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of witness/loss emerges organically via grain reprise shifting from symbol to proof; final line's "coldest and loneliest places" offers resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in lunar-specific noticing (regolith monuments, chemical depth); rhythmic modulation builds hush to sharp silence without distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied syntax breathes with contemplative pressure. Minor paraphrase in hush descriptions, but no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of space-age introspection transforms lunar tropes via chemical antiquity and grain continuity; quiet CR feels inevitable from obsessive witnessing.</comment>
