<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong consistent motivation rooted in patient cataloging that compels the final resolve; interiority concrete via embodied perceptions like worn stamp handle. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for 9+; epiphanic shift feels serene without raw friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern density from marginalia to manuscript discovery tightening knowledge; Charged Poise closure in "resolve crystallized... sediment settling" reconfigures her archival role with conceptual cost of cunning subtlety vs power. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Candlelight and dense stillness constrain perception, narrowing attention to marginalia during blackout; recurring library stacks and false panel charge final sanctuary image. Sensory selection (density of quiet, waterline city) purposefully mirrors internal discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tracing hidden truths signaled early, deepens accumulatively via hypothesis-testing to manuscript reveal forcing stance crystallization; one tightening in stamp comparison narrows options with felt cost of inherited duty. Agency in micro-choices like pressing stamp legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of truths hidden in bureaucracy's margins emerges organically through annotations and sanctuary; final image offers non-literal resonant answer via "adding her own annotations," reweighting preservation's cunning cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in tranquil observations; rhythmic modulation builds from patient cataloging to crystalline resolve. Prose texture distinct in syntax reflecting mind under candlelit pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops ("stillness... quiet... density," "tranquilly perceptive") and elevated diction drifts dull two peak observation beats; no closure touch allows high band recovery. Varied sentence openings propel accumulatively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic marginalia as covert archive transforms trope of hidden knowledge; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes of subtle defiance, inevitable in hindsight via stamp reprise.</comment>
