<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction between skepticism and drowsy pull ("religiously skeptical nature fighting against the oppressive atmosphere"); micro-choices like slow approach reveal values. Final confession earned via prior resistance yielding to radio voices' pressure. Minor slip: final understanding paragraph summarizes epiphany slightly beyond embodied action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry to ghost shift (inciting: hand on wheel dims light) to radio bleed-through, tightening via personalized voices narrowing skeptical stance. On-page CR closure ("finally, he spoke") reconfigures premise with emotional cost legible in "swallowed truth" release. Orientation anchored early (tunnel drop); single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel's damp bricks, shadows, and valve wheel constrain advance and charge final hand-placement, mirroring internal thinning ("walls seemed to breathe"). Sensory hierarchy (headlamp carve, ear pressure) reflects urgency; selective details evolve with ghost shift. Final image recharges wheel as confession conduit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (skeptical proof-seeking) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via ghost shift voices forcing personal interpretation, foreclosing dismissal with radio's "swallowed truths." One tightening (wheel turns unbidden) narrows to confession trade-off. Cost felt in drowsy pulse-awareness; agency in listening/placing hand.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of confession's weight emerges via radio chorus and wheel's spin, reweighting skepticism without statement; final "he spoke" offers non-literal resonance to "burden too heavy." Subtext in silences (hush) and irony (skeptic hears truths). No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in supernatural door.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with skeptical perceptual bias ("just machinery"); diction modulates to drowsy rhythm ("warm blanket") under stress. No head-hopping or withholding; compression purposeful in shift's subtlety. Distinct texture in syntax builds immersion without filter stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., "beads spinning with a sound like distant prayer beads"); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor cliché ("electricity in his chest") but no muddle in peak (wheel turn/radio). Clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: urban explorer's ghost shift via radio confessions transforms trope into personal truth-weighing, with beaded wheel as ingenious pivot. Risky quiet CR ("he spoke") inevitable from setup; no template echoes, committed to drowsy supernatural logic.</comment>
