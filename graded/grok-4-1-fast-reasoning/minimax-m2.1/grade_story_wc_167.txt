<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in embodied details like the stone's "cool weight" and ripple-watching patience, revealing a hierarchy of values in her ritual before the day; subtle endurance of serenity amid looming demands earns the final stance. Lacks sharper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal micro-choice, muting flaw-driven struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly, building density from pond ripples to misted light for a Charged Poise closure in the final lines where she carries the "pond's lesson" into reasserting demands, with felt cost in stillness-to-motion shift. Orientation anchors immediately in harbor/pond; one meaningful cadence tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory details like "warped windows" and "salty wind" filter through her perceptual bias, constraining ritual via pond proximity and charging final mist-lift image. Micro-setting (pond stone) mirrors internal states purposefully without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of pre-dawn clarity ritual escalates via ripple expansion/stilling and boat engine intrusion, forcing endurance under accumulative lens with on-page cost in moment's end. Tightening forecloses isolation via dawning world; agency in observation/turning suffices but lacks sharper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of illuminating mundane emerges organically from ripple patterns and glasswork converging in final reconfiguration of "predictable patterns" as discovery sites, offering resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Particulars like pond rings avoid platitudes, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature in refraction/ripple noticing; rhythmic prose modulates meditatively to clarifying poise without filter excess. Perceptual bias (geometric light) biases selection consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image-packed lines; purposeful metaphors (ripples as "scripture") teach pattern early without muddle. Minor elevated diction in peak reflection ("cathedral colors") borders register drift but serves voice without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glazier-as-seer via ripple/glass patterns transforms mundane dawn ritual into profound reconfiguration; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes organically. Final image inevitability grows from established particulars without hedging.</comment>
