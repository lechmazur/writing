<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete perceptual bias (frost as "language of unfinished business"); final realization earned by accumulated readings with embodied cost of self-merging. Contradictory impulses in observing others while becoming observed. Hairline slip in occasional diagnostic phrasing ("emotional archaeology") doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening to CR closure ("assumptions shattered... new understanding"); cost legible in "her own essence slowly merging with the stone." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene pristine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, moss, mist constrain and mirror via tactile grounding ("cold seep upward through her bones"); car window frost as micro-setting charges every beat. Recurring quartz "emotional library" evolves to final self-absorption image, gating 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving emotional absorption) deepens texturally via pattern shifts to personal cost; prism flash reversal narrows to self-realization under lens. Agency in persistent reading forecloses detachment. Minor abstractness early, but closure cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from frost patterns and prism interference to CR ("people could pour themselves into places"); resonant non-literal answer in smile amid cycle, reweighting without moral. Counter-reading in "probable truths others would offer" adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (crystals as "whispers," frost "script"); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise. Purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring hush-to-conversation arc; purposeful metaphors (light "fragmented reassurance") cohere without muddle. Minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but pattern-taught; no loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional archaeology transforms mystic trope via frost mechanics and self-absorption CR; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes inevitability. No derivative echoes; bold premise commits fully.</comment>
