<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Gardener's tender handling of the case and tapestry reveals consistent traits of care amid the silent dead; realization in "He had spent his life among the silent" earns closure via prior causality without contradiction, though blithe spirit feels slightly archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discovery density builds to Conceptual Repricing in final paragraphs, with legible orientation by ivy-trimming opener; closure cost felt in humble reception of sovereign's intent, reweighting premise without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt silo's blue-tinged stone and starlight constrain decoding scene tactilely, charging final image; velveteen gloom and frayed threads filter through gardener's perceptual bias, evolving purposefully without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding uncharted echoes tightens via border revelation, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens; cost legible in foreclosed ignorance as he climbs out with organized understanding, though pressure remains gently accumulative rather than sharply agency-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of hearing silent intentions emerges organically from tapestry decoding, with chess motif shifting to humble compassion; final image of tucked case offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting sovereign's question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in "tender care he applied to all things connected to the dead"; rhythmic prose modulates from blithe humming to velveteen introspection, no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density in silo's "shadows that had the texture of deep velvet" propels via varied rhythm; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "velveteen gloom" slightly dulls peak decoding without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cemetery silo-tapestry encoding transforms hidden message trope through gardener's lived specificity; risk in poetic conceit of decoding threads heightens stakes organically to charged close.</comment>
