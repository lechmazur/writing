<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kira's motivation to prove sideways time drives lever pulls with embodied excitement (breath caught in icy air), rooted in mechanic traits; mechanically warm fingertips reveal hybrid nature under pressure. Minimal internal contradiction limits to strong but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from subdued awakenings to dual molt observation, culminating in lever click as Conceptual Repricing with conceptual cost to linear time premise; orientation anchored early, pattern holds cleanly to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Station's cold recycled air and velith-wing membranes constrain observations (cold for specimens vs. Kira's warmth), charging final multiplicity image; selective sensory details (hum vibrations, prismatic blueprints) filter through mechanic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove hypothesis) tightens via first velith-wing's dual phases under accumulative lens, forcing nexus full activation; agency in lever pulls forecloses doubt with legible conceptual stakes in proof moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of sideways time emerges organically from metamorphic observations, resonant in final hush of impossible multiplicity reweighting linear reality without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with mechanic's tactile perceptual signature (worn lever surface); rhythmic prose modulates from subdued to cascade intensity; ARIA dialogue natural and functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel nexus activation; minor figurative density (membranes as book pages) in rising beats purposeful, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanic proving sideways time via alien cycles feels inevitable, transforming xenobio trope through tactile lever and holographic grids.</comment>
