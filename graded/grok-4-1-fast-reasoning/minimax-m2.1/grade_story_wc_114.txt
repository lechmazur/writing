<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions—copper mouth, stone in chest—and micro-choice of touching the smudge earns the final realization and forecast, revealing values hierarchy without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as observations densify to Charged Poise closure; touching the illustration reconfigures grief with legible emotional cost in "heart finally light enough," orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Station and aurora constrain choices (console hesitation, frost patterns mirroring doubt); botanical illustration as micro-setting charges final image, sensory details POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of doubt-ridden forecasting tightens via touch-induced deepening that narrows options (terror swallowed for precision); agency in typing forecast forecloses paralysis with felt release cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragile certainty emerges organically from swaying antenna image and smudge touch; final illustration in auroral light offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting grief without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (instruments chitter, frost as rivers); rhythmic diction modulates from fever-uncertain to precise, elisions taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and no loops; purposeful metaphors (aurora as grief curtain) integrate without muddle, propulsion clear in peak realization beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorological oracle haunted by predecessor's art transforms guilt trope; smudge touch and margins method offer non-obvious reconfiguration risk heightening closure.</comment>
