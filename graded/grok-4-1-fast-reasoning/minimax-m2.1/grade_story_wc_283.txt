<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in calloused fingers and attuned eyes sensing button histories; motivation to uncover small truths compels patient choices scaling to discovery. Earned change in recognizing prophecy as accumulative pattern forecloses dismissive attitudes with humility's cost. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, but micro-choices under solitary pressure reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from routine cataloging to jar discovery ("Canyon Echo") and pattern emergence, tightening knowledge with patient weeks' felt cost. Orientation anchors Elara/warehouse/Veleth by para 2. Closure as CR reconfigures prophecy via living system, cost legible in return to work with deepened resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber glow, honeyed walls, unearthed silence selectively filter through Elara's priorities, mirroring internal attunement. Buttons as micro-setting constrain cataloging choices and charge final hands holding whispers. Evolves causally with jar integration; no tourist catalog, all tactile/lived.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (small truths vs. grand scrolls) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via jar to pattern with weeks' time cost narrowing options. Pressure coheres texturally, forcing stance crystallization in humble return. One tightening sufficient; minor abstractness in "emotional resonance" but on-page tests via cross-referencing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Shared wisdom emerges from button particulars and canyon whisper, reweighting prophecy non-literally in living system image. Final "wisdom shared is wisdom multiplied" borders direct statement but anchors in prior accumulation without moralizing. Resonance from humble flaws, invites ambiguity in unfinished stories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature biased to silence/humming histories (e.g., "voice waiting to be heard across centuries"). Rhythmic control modulates from quiet arrival to echo intensity, diction purposeful/textural. No dialogue; compression taught early, pays off in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory/insight (e.g., "honeyed glow that had nothing to do with any mortal light") without loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion breathes with scene; no figurative muddle, overwriting purposeful for texture. Paragraph test passes; zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Buttons-as-wisdom fragments transform prophecy trope into fresh accumulative frame, inevitable in hindsight via jar/button cross-link. Bold risk in solitary lyricism heightens quiet stakes; no hedging, full premise commitment to small truths' power.</comment>
