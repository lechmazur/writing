<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in grandmother's legacy and leadership accumulation compels the bell-ringing choice with felt endurance cost; interiority concrete in "the metal so cold it burned." Minor weakness: internal conflict more summarized than dramatized in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during the ringing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from backstory shards to arbor gathering; orientation anchored early (Mira, settlement, sanctions by para 2). Closure as Charged Poise in "Farouk knelt beside the old woman without being asked," reconfiguring exile as continuation with undeniable persistence cost; exact final image "silver bell rang on" makes before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor constrains resistance as "visible from the valley below where the guards patrolled," charging final gathering image. Sensory details like "clay paths" and "breathing patterns of exhausted sleep" filter through Mira's priorities, evolving with midnight action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (eroding hope under sanctions) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via food runs to bell summoning gathering, narrowing to intergenerational endurance with agency in ringing. Cost legible in "slow erosion of hope that sanctions inflict"; one decisive cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of legacy passing against loss emerges organically from bell's generational wear to Mariem/Farouk moment, offering resonant non-literal answer in final declaration. Slight thematic echo in "no border could silence" borders on stating moral, but ambiguity lingers in outlasting sanctions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "grief of proximity, how cruelty often lives next door to compassion"; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise without elision or head-hopping. No dialogue, so n/a.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with lines like "gently persistent, the way water eventually carves stone" advancing character/atmosphere; varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds, zero figurative muddle in peak gathering beat. Propulsion peaks cleanly in final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exile tropes via bell as "whisper becoming a promise," transforming sanctions into backdrop for intergenerational crucible; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
