<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in Elena's bold interrogation and hand placement, earned by prior causality with the cost of perpetuating lies; tutor's enigmatic traits shown through actions like seal handling reveal character under relational pressure. Interiority particular and embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of supernatural hints from sugar borrowing to rooftop hand-touch closure (Charged Poise/CR), reconfiguring truth-seeking with legible cost in "agreed-upon lies continued"; orientation anchored by ~50 words, one tightening via meteor shower boldness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Building syntax (sagging beams, groaning pipes) and rooftop meteor shower constrain intimacy and charge final hand-touch image; sensory details (cool hand, streaking stars) filtered through Elena's curiosity bias evolve purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding place/tutor via dead languages) signaled early, escalates accumulatively to interrogation tightening that narrows options; agency peaks in hand placement foreclosing full revelation with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of truths too vast for words emerges organically from seal's grave origin and hand-touch, final image reweighting "membrane between real and true" without moralizing; subtext in tutor's deflections invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (buildings as legible entities); voice rhythmic and biased, dialogue subtextual ("some signatures... spaces between"); purposeful compression taught early holds to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring emotional deepening; no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (stars as "corrections," buildings "leaning inward"); peak clarity in hand-touch beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undead tutor teaching architectural necromancy transforms ghost trope via seal's exhumation and meteor acceptance; risk in CR closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
