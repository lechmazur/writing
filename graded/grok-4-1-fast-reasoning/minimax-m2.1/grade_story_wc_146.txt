<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in shared balance intensifies through calculated 7000 footsteps, embodied in aching legs; interiority particular via "patience of rocks." Micro-choices like naming buildings reveal values under pressure. Competent without deep flaws slightly limits peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: footsteps accumulate density to critical mass, culminating in Charged Poise RR at "cobblestones had begun to respond... archway hummed." Orientation anchored by para 1; cost legible in physical ache and unfinished 2000 steps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobblestones as pulse-taking setting constrain circuits and charge final buzz in boots; archway as "tuning peg" mirrors internal resonance. Sensory hierarchy (vibration in marrow/feet) reflects tuner's ear. Micro-setting (fork warms) evolves tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revival) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via repeated paths to buzz response; agency in patient walking forecloses quick fixes. Cost visible in "legs ached... fork grown warm," charging final image. Minor abstractness in "seven thousand repetitions" before embodiment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resonance/balance emerges via naming buildings and sympathetic hum, reweighting silence in final archway vibration without moralizing. Particulars (ironwood fork, root interconnections) avoid platitudes; lingering ambiguity in unfinished steps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("frequency the town had lost," stone's patience) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from hush to hum. Compression purposeful, taught early in tuning metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/imagery (e.g., "moss had worn the stone to velvet"); varied rhythm propels without loops. Minor elevated diction ("sympathetic vibrations") fits voice but risks drift in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic ecology and patience transforms ghost town trope; footsteps-as-revival risks boldly, inevitable in hindsight via calculated mass. Ironwood fork/7000 steps particularize ingenuity.</comment>
