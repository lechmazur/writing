<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Affectionate skeptic shines in opening "skepticism warring with something else," embodied via somatic markers and micro-choice to press crystal; contradictory impulses act in scene, final resolve earned with cost of fragile hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light refractions, somatic sync, visions culminate in CR ("She would devise... willowglass hope") with conceptual cost of fragility legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Studio's RGB glow and geode constrain perception and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (cool crystal, pulse) reflects scientific POV bias, selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (gentler connection post-pills) signaled early, tightens via crystal contact deepening impressions; under accum lens, cost unmistakable in "fragile and breakable, but still beautiful."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of invitational vs. intrusive connection emerges organically from crystal visions; final "willowglass hope" offers resonant non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (scientific precision + hope); rhythmic control modulates from skepticism to illumination, diction biased and concrete.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops; purposeful "seemed" reps build uncertainty payoff, propulsion peaks in somatic beats without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geode telepathy transforms telepathy trope via fractal/somatic specificity; risk of lyric CR heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
