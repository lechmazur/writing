<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between eternal multiplicity as gift/prison drives integration quest, with micro-choices like touching fractures revealing values; embodied emotion leans conceptual ("wanting that had grown into curse") without full crisis degradation, but change feels earned at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density deepens from surface viaduct to shadowed history fractures, taught early via tablet runes; CR closure lands on-page ("ripples... in patterns she could finally control") with conceptual cost of perpetual fragmentation reconfigured as controllable, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Viaduct stones pulse/retain light, constrain floating path across selves and charge final image as eternal bridge; sensory selection (glowing, darkening) reflects psychic urgency through POV bias, vivid yet economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-integration) signaled early, tightens via deepening density into core fragmentation under Accumulative lens, forcing endurance/renunciation of wholeness with legible conceptual cost; one reversal (first fracture to child self) narrows options agency-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fractured self-integration emerges organically from retracing beats/images, final CR reweights premise non-literally ("she would be the one who had dropped it") without moralizing; resonant ambiguity in eternal cost lingers from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable/single, perceptual signature fractured/temporal ("flickering across centuries"); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity (short sentences at fractures), diction purposeful and biased, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm/syntax supports psychic deepening; minor metaphor density ("wound in the air," "darkening brightness") risks overwrite in mid-beats but pattern-taught/coherent, no loops/scaffold dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of procedural time navigation as psychological labyrinth transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in nonlinear self-shards heightens stakes, inevitable CR from premise without retreat or templates.</comment>
