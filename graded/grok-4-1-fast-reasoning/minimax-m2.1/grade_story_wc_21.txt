<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation as archivist intensifies credibly from diary deciphering to kneeling at lagoon edge, with embodied reverie ("searing mixture of grief and wonder") revealing character under pressure. Interior conflict emerges in micro-choice to walk alone despite colleagues. Final witness role earns closure via prior causality, foreclosing anonymity with felt historical weight. No major slips touch peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of diary revelations, debris cipher, and lagoon ripple build to CR closure where grandmother's crystalline rise reconfigures Miriam's stake as witness, with conceptual cost of carrying unsung history legible in "final message she needed Miriam to carry forward." Orientation anchored early (zeppelin over dunes). One tightening suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective details like "crescent of beach debris" constrain choice (kneeling to trace cipher) and charge final image (grandmother rising from depths). Sensory hierarchy via POV: archivist notices deliberate patterns amid dunes. Zeppelin hovers as lived-in anchor, evolving with descent. No white-room; spatial choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (family truth/parley) signaled early via diary, tightens accumulatively through debris reading to apparition, narrowing options to witness role with felt cost of deferred truth. Protagonist agency in solitary walk and tracing letters forces stance crystallization. No abstract stakes; pressure coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory's temporal prison emerges organically from diary shards, debris cipher, and crystalline apparition, reweighting "truth deferred but never destroyed" without statement. Final image answers witness question via resonant reconfiguration, embracing ambiguity of "when all others had forgotten." No moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: historical bias filters "yellowed pages," "sun-bleached bone." Lyrical rhythm modulates with intensity, compressing at ripple ("water began to ripple despite the windless afternoon"). No head-hopping; diction character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (e.g., "pressed the yellowed pages against her chest"); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor figurative density ("golden sea caught mid-wave") purposeful under reverie tone, no muddle or loops in closure beat. No scaffold; clean syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms archival trope via zeppelin descent to obsidian parley apparition, with retrocognitive loop as fresh synthesis driving CR. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; no derivative echoes. Bold premise commits fully.</comment>
