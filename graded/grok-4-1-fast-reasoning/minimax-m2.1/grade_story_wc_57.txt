<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied in pattern-seeing eyes and patient coaxing; realization earned via decades-trained observation without unearned epiphany. Traits like patience constrain actions holistically. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from rope knots to fulgurite revelation, culminating in CR closure ("he understood finally why...") with conceptual cost of weaving knowledge into practice. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dock, fulgurite, and rope constrain revelation choice and charge final coiling image; sensory hierarchy (creak, brine, hush) reflects Elias's patient priorities. Weather (snow, fog) evolves causally, mirroring internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding inheritance) deepens accumulatively via fulgurite over knots, narrowing to preservation commitment; agency in patient observation forecloses passive ignorance with felt generational cost. One tightening sufficient but lacks sharper trade-off for 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of preservation-through-practice emerges from seed/knot parallels, resolved non-literally in final planning image reweighting inheritance as "fragile hull." No moralizing; ambiguity in "patient as the tide" lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (spirals in seeds/ropes); rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive to charged hush, supporting lyric Accumulative lens without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fog thickened... oceanic hush settle into his bones"); varied rhythm, no loops or muddled metaphors despite lyric figuration taught early. Minor overwriting in opening doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed genetics, knot encoding, fulgurite reading transforms inheritance trope; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative structure heightens philosophical stakes organically.</comment>
