<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between scientific preprocessing and "unreliable organ" heart act vividly in butterfly dust moment, earning CR shift with felt cost in foreclosed dramatic framing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as dust density builds from finger to leaves; CR closure lands on-page with conceptual cost ("preprocessing...had cost her") reweighting endings in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Storm-damaged greenhouse and rosemary bush constrain crouching amid shards, with dust spreading on leaves charging final image per 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (dramatic vs. gradual endings) deepens accumulatively via butterfly death and return discovery, narrowing options with liberating yet costly realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Resonant CR via dust fingerprint reweights cosmic/butterfly deaths non-literally, emerging organically from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Scientific perceptual signature (light curves in thumb grooves) rhythms with emotional modulation; stable third-limited POV enhances lyric texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels reflection; minor dust-pattern paraphrase loop ("accumulated dust patterns") doesn't obscure CR image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh cosmic/small-death synthesis via dust light-curve analogy feels inevitable; bold lyric risk heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
