<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between skepticism and wonder act through instruments and final trust realization; Mira's micro-choices under time pressure reveal values with embodied cost in "weight of her people's dispersed memories." Final merging of dreams earned by causal buildup of legacy and journey. No unearned epiphanies; interiority concrete and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase to CR closure: seed's dream as "knowing that bloomed behind her eyes" reweights verification premise with conceptual cost of unprovable trust legible in final image. Orientation anchored early via workbench and ridge path; single scene arc tightens purposefully. No ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bloom-flower and ridge constrain awakening choice and charge final image; sensory details (memory-moths, luminous scent, purple monsoon) selective via Mira's professional POV, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (seed in flower's heart) evolves causally, pressuring outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken seed to reclaim memory before monsoon) signaled early, tightens via journey urgency and dream-deepening that forces stance shift; agency in pressing seed and interpreting under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in foreclosed verification path and felt monsoon threat, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trust over verification emerges organically from particulars (seed awakening via unmeasurable dreams); final image of memories "scattered like seeds" offers resonant CR answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in "crystalline doubt" lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (professional wonder: "instruments could measure but her heart could name"); rhythmic diction modulates from cataloging to blooming intensity, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., path crushes "wild thyme and something else—something luminous"); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in peak dream beat purposeful and coherent, not muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reality-checking profession and knowledge seed transforms memory tropes; "seventeen shades of possibility" and empirical whimsy feel inevitable, risk-taking in lyric CR heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
