<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with contradictory impulses—loving the changeling despite alien heart—embodied in kneeling and pouch opening; final forgiveness earned via tooth placement with cost of accepting fractures as windows.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from garden entry to tooth glow as CR closure, reweighting certainty with conceptual cost legible in constellation patterns; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden's hedge gap and fountain channels constrain entry and charge final image, with POV-biased details like calendula mirroring shrewd innocence; selective sensory integration via palm on stone elevates to 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of soul-mending tightens via tooth luminescence narrowing certainty into constellations; agency in placement forecloses tidy ending with felt cost of persistent ambiguity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fractures as windows emerges organically from bone-setting metaphor and final star-mapping image, reweighting mistakes without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in laughter and new stars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature—shrewdly innocent noticing mother's herbs—modulates rhythmically; diction like "wisely foolish" reflects mind under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and no loops; purposeful metaphors like bone-setting integrate without muddle, propelling to closure glow; zero artifacts in peak tooth beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh changeling synthesis via bone-setting and constellations transforms folklore tropes; risk in lyric CR heightens stakes without gimmickry, though familiar mother-sanctuary motif tempers peak score.</comment>
