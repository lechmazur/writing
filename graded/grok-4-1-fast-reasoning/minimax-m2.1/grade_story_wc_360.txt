<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via object-borrowed emotions (widow's ring, child's toy); contradictory impulses in self-erasure for precision; final borrowing from halo earns transparency with cost of loosening boundaries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of borrowed personalities tightens to halo interaction; CR closure in "boundaries loosening into something that resembled light but felt like liberation," with conceptual cost of endless transcription legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Topaz light as "condition of perception" and halo constrain choices (picked up, held); workshop glows post-stars, charging final image; selective sensory filter (glow, hum) reflects POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mathematics of emotion) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via fragment pulse narrowing to self-borrow; agency in holding to chest forecloses self-boundaries with felt cost at "becoming transparent."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of emotion-as-language emerges via printing proofs, reweighted in final "endless transcription of questions"; resonant non-literal answer in halo dissolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("arithmetic of the soul"); rhythmic control modulates from steady heart to pulsing light; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts; figurative coherence ("tear from something that could no longer hold its sorrow") propels without muddle, even in peak halo beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress-empathy and cosmic transition; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in halo dissolution recharging star motifs.</comment>
