<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied, with contradictory impulses in enduring treatment costs while secretly drumming the signal; final endurance earned as rebellion feeds the dream with visible subjection price. Quiet rebellion shown concretely in choosing to stay post-vomiting and ignoring scientists' gaze.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to cadence shift where drumming pattern triggers garden convergence on lagoon, yielding Charged Poise RR with conceptual cost of entangled persistence amid exploitation. Orientation anchored early; closure cost legible in "feeding the dream... universe that had taken too much."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garden's responsive elements (resonance trees, harmonic ferns) constrain choices via tactile mechanics, charging final cascade; recurrent lagoon as micro-setting pulses with breath under starlight, mirroring internal stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reviving dream via entanglement) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through learned drumming to garden response, narrowing to presence felt with endurance cost of guinea-pig status. Climax agency in persisting pattern amid potential discovery tightens pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of suspended dreams emerges organically from entanglement and garden song, reweighted non-literally in final "Mira smiled" image tying rebellion to cosmic sorrow without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with synesthetic perceptual signature (sound-color ripples, pulsing moss); rhythmic modulation heightens ritual intensity, elisions purposeful and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, metaphors consistent (ripples, waves) without muddle in peak drumming cascade; minor figurative density in climax but purposeful for textural lens, rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic garden and neural entanglement transforms therapy trope into rebellious sanctuary; risk in lyric sci-fi closure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from childhood signal.</comment>
