<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between past skepticism and present belief acts vividly in the palm-press moment, earning the final acceptance of "beyond the boundary of proof" with embodied weeping as cost. Chronically curious trait drives micro-choices like staying until light fades. No diagnostic labels; flaws complicate via initial dismissal of ring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: actions build density to CR closure where Heron's reunion reconfigures empirical stance, cost legible in "habits break" realization and ongoing expeditions. Orientation anchors immediately via boat-to-wreck approach. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse's glass dome and ship-ring constrain swim and press actions; broken light through kelped wrecks charges Heron's final image. Sensory filter (cold suit, warm mushroom) reflects folklorist's priorities. Micro-setting (ceramic pipes, twisted roots) mirrors memory preservation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover grandmother's face) signaled early, tightens via constellation alignment forcing palm-press under deepening bioluminescent pressure. Agency in endurance (stays till fade) forecloses skeptical distance with emotional cost in tears. Accumulative escalation via memory bloom suffices; no reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity's conversion emerges organically from ring's warmth vs. past phosphorescence dismissal, resonating in final "memory, like starlight, travels strange paths" without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from folklore-vs-proof tension. Subtext in stolen memories implies elder wisdom's endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature biases toward patterns ("splintered fingers," "broken constellations"); syntax modulates from precise mapping to lyrical release in weeping beat. Stable distance, no leakage; rhythmic control peaks in Heron's assembly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pressed his palm... watched as the constellation's broken pieces assembled"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor metaphor density in opening fits accumulative texture without muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore, astronomy fragments, and bioluminescent memory-detection transforms tropes; risk in CR closure ("something new can begin") heightens via precise, non-obvious ship-ringed marsh logic. Irreplaceable ingenuity in Heron's recovery reweighting skepticism.</comment>
