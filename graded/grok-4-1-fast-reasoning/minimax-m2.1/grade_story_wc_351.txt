<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Helix-minded traits shown concretely through recursive thinking early, driving discovery and final choices with embodied realization; interiority particular without stock phrasing. Transformation earned via causal buildup, but lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak modification beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memories and realizations builds to RR closure in final paragraph ("fundamentally different") with legible conceptual cost of irreversible neural integration. Single scene, clear orientation by para 2, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon and mirror constrain choices (kneeling/work through night) and charge final image of "ghosts in the morning light." Sensory details selective via engineer's perceptual bias, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unwinding mind escalates accumulatively via mirror discovery → memory lattice → purposeful modification, narrowing to transformed identity with felt cost of synaptic irreversibility. Agency in overnight work forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of excavating abandoned dreams emerges organically from mirror's lattice and final ghost image, reweighting premise without moralizing; resonant CR ties character arc to conceptual cost of revived aspirations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with helix-signature perception ("strange mathematics of her helix-minded thinking"); rhythmic prose modulates from patient to charged, perceptual bias consistent under transformation pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels from setup to peak without loops or scaffolds; minor figurative density ("entangled lattice") purposeful, no artifacts dulling closure image of lifted mirror.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of entangled memories in relic transforms artifact trope into dream archaeology; risk of conceptual transformation pays off inevitably in final reconfiguration, no derivative echoes.</comment>
