<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (absorb impact yet actively resist via symbols) act in scene, with final endurance earned by causal buildup of her dual allegiance; stone chip grounds embodied emotion throughout. Micro-choices like selecting specific symbols reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of symbols builds to Charged Poise closure in final paragraph, where stone shifts from relic to promise with felt cost of inevitable change; orientation anchored early in Flotilla District.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring canals/rafts constrain choices (underside dock, hidden pockets) and charge final image of network spreading; sensory details (creaking rafts, urgent music) filtered through Mira's priorities mirror internal tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape gentrification) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through symbol density tightening community response; agency in painting forecloses surrender with legible cost in "dual allegiance" realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of stone as "promise" offers resonant answer to community vs. commerce theme, reweighting motifs without moralizing; emerges organically from symbols and gentrification pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("orderly intuitive rhythm") biases noticing (mapping faces/symbols); rhythmic prose modulates with rising urgency, stable close third-person limited.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels accumulatively; no loops, purposeful figures like "quiet tide" integrate without muddle, even in peak painting beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of raft-city carnival with encoded graffiti transforms gentrification trope; risk in cipher tradition heightens stakes, feels inevitable in closure.</comment>
