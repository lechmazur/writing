<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied details like "stone that had learned to breathe" and contradictory impulses between solving loss and sitting with it; final dovetailing renunciation earned through micro-choices like pressing eyes; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly in single scene; orientation anchored immediately in cavern orchard; closure as Charged Poise RR/CR lands decisively in "dovetailed with it" with felt cost of acceptance foreclosing brute solving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mosaic stepping stones and stalactites constrain path to center and charge final offering; sensory details (phosphorescent glow, dripping) filtered through pattern-obsessed POV; micro-setting mirrors internal imperfection without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving ambiguous loss tightens via silence as "held breath" cadence shift, narrowing to endurance/renunciation; agency in eye-use and placement shows visible cost (aching knees, left offering); minor abstractness in internal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of emotion's geometry emerges organically from mosaic/eyes/orchard particulars, reweighting loss via final image without statement; resonant non-literal answer in dovetailed grief; complexity lingers in buried hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (patterns in blur/sharpen); rhythmic modulation builds to compressed silence; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "chipped patterns... deliberate imperfection"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative consistency (dovetail, water through stone) taught as voice without muddle in peak silence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxidermy eyes, emotion-math, cavern orchard transforms loss trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight from chipped mosaic payoff.</comment>
