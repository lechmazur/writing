<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solitary Mira's warmly curious trait drives micro-choices like tenderly noting the root around the skull despite fatigue, earning her final reconfiguration; interiority concrete and embodied without diagnostic labels. Contradictory impulses (fatigue vs. purpose) act in excavation beats. Final endurance of ancestral faith feels motivated by consistent traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries build density to Charged Poise closure when Mira places gnomon ("click into place as though it had been waiting"), reweighting journeys with felt homecoming cost in final image. Orientation anchored early (entrance, village, war backstory cued concretely). One tightening via sundial find narrows to restoration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard's roots-between-bones recur, constraining solo excavation and charging final moonlight image where roots "like arms reaching for sky." Sensory hierarchy (wet earth, lantern flicker) reflects Mira's priorities; details tactile and evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve interrupted journeys/restore faith) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via sundial match to birthmark, forcing endurance with fatigue cost; agency in purposeful rebuild narrows to conceptual repricing. Visible price: two-year delay, great-aunt's death compound isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical renewal emerges from root/bone/apple tree particulars, answered non-literally in final sundial shadow promising pilgrims; roots motif shifts from tenderness to rebirth without moralizing. Resonance inextricable from Mira's arc, inviting ambiguity of loss regained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (cautious enchantment in "warmly curious despite her fatigue") biases noticing runes/birthmark link; rhythmic prose modulates from trembling shadows to crystallized poise. No head-hopping or withholding; diction controlled and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer sensory/action/insight without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies read-aloud, peaking in "click into place" image. Zero figurative muddle, precise verbs (pushed, brushed, cleared); opening anchors stakes tightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard premise synthesizes diaspora archaeology with root/bone renewal ingeniously, transforming burial trope via sundial/birthmark turn grown from particulars. Risky solo texture heightens stakes; final image inevitable in hindsight without hedging.</comment>
