<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional: Elara's contradictory impulses—bound by her own despair yet compelled to aid Mira—act simultaneously in the echo-production beat, earning her release as felt cost when "the weight of the coin lift[s] from her palm." Mira's reactions reveal credible endurance of failure. No unearned epiphanies; traits shown through synesthetic embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echoes layers from coin's hum to orchard glow, tightening to Charged Poise closure where Mira touches coin and timelines "rejoin[] the fractured whole," with Elara's tether as conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early (gates, shop). Single scene flows coherently; no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orchard garden with "silver-tinged apples" and maze paths constrain encounter, charging final hum and "lights of morning" image. Synesthetic details (violets, rust-rain) filter through Elara's POV, mirroring internal states via purposeful selection. Spatial choreography clear (aisles to courtyard to tree).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (despair-to-possibility) signaled via Elara sensing Mira's "trail of despair," escalates accumulatively as echoes layer to dozen figures, forcing Mira's stance crystallization on touch. Protagonist agency in raising coin/whisper; cost legible in "necessary failure" realization. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of despair as "door leading to rooms not yet explored" emerges organically from echo-tapestry, reweighted non-literally in coin's "colors bleeding together into something new" without moralizing. Final image offers resonant answer to fractured possibilities. Complexity lingers in "honey and guilt."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elara POV with synesthetic perceptual signature (grief as "crushed velvet"); rhythmic control modulates from drift to glow under climax pressure. Whisper dialogue natural/subtextual: "Choose... There are always encores." No head-hopping; voice distinct and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines like "ripples of light spread outward, and suddenly the orchard filled with ghosts" advance multiple layers. Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; purposeful figuratives (e.g., "old velvet curtains") consistent without muddle in peak echo-beat. Minor overwriting in openings doesn't touch closure.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesis of synesthetic ghost-magician and timeline-echoes transforms tropes into fresh inevitability: coin's final spin reconfigures failures as "seed of success." Bold risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens nostalgic stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes.</comment>
