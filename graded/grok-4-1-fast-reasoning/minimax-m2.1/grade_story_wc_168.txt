<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied scars and box-handling reveals contradictory impulses (tenderness amid hardness); final vigil earns renunciation of innocence with visible cost in rebuilt self. Minor epiphanic phrasing ("hard softness she had learned") doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflection density tightens to Charged Poise closure (box to lips/heart, reconfiguring loss as light) with felt cost (Elena's death). Orientation anchors early (scars, path, fire); single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ridge path, ash stumps, and crazed mirror constrain vigil choice and charge final image (moonlight fragments → scattered memories). Sensory selection (tactile boots/path, visual celestial dance) reflects firefighter bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor bargain via translation) signaled early, textural escalation via deepening reflection (box mirror gaze) forecloses innocence path; cost legible in "cost Elena her life." Minor abstractness pre-closure keeps under 9.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming loss emerges organically from box/flower/scars; final image (tuck box to heart) offers resonant answer (burning to light) reweighting premise without moral. No direct statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (fire-shaped noticing: ash defiance, controlled burns); rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate climb to vigilant poise. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to closure; purposeful metaphors (moonlight fragments, stars witness) cohere without muddle. Minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but supports textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of firefighter trauma via porcelain box ritual transforms survival trope; ridge vigil's "bargain with loss" feels inevitable. Avoids generic recovery arc through specific scars/box.</comment>
