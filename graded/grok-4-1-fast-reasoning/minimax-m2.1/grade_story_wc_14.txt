<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in grandmother's method intensifies compellingly with the hum's shift, shown in embodied actions like palm on glass; internal endurance earned through isolation's felt cost; minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup in observations culminating in pattern break ("the hum had changed") and CR closure via final prism image reweighting silence as full of voices; cost legible in "patience of someone who knows that time is not a river but a forest"; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bonsai forest and lamp constrain listening work and charge final image ("workshop seemed to exist in two times at once"); sensory details selectively POV-biased and purposeful; 9+ test met as recurring objects shape closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstruct histories via frequencies) signaled early with textural tightening via hum change narrowing interpretive options; agency in ritual endurance forecloses departure path with isolation cost; sufficient for length under lens but lacks deeper trade-off visibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as layered histories emerges organically from particulars like bonsai rings and refracted light; final image offers resonant non-literal answer ("every silence contains a thousand voices") reweighting premise without moralizing; 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in frequency/hum metaphors; rhythmic control modulates beautifully under ritual "pressure"; purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, varied rhythm, and coherent metaphors (e.g., "light through water"); minor paraphrase loops on "silence" motif purposeful but deduct slightly; no artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stationer charting electrical hums for temporal textures transforms silence trope organically; risk-taking in textural lens heightens stakes via ritual's isolation; inevitable in hindsight with closure payoff.</comment>
