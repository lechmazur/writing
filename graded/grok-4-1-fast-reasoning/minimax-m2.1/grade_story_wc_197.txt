<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's resourcefulness is embodied through concrete micro-choices like reading puddle reflections and using the worn key, rooting her motivation in grandmother's legacy. Interiority particularizes her as palimpsest-reader without stock epiphanies. Final shift from invisibility to distributor earned by prior preservation, but lacks overt contradictory impulses in peak descent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hidden truths builds from desk audit to vault discovery. Orientation anchored by ~100 words (filing clerk in Ministry halls). Charged Poise closure in descent—"The archive would be distributed"—reconfigures options with siren cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Auric lagoon constrains path (wading to stones) and charges final image (shimmering above descent). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: ghost-structures, mineral glow reflect preserver's eye. Puddle-map integrates action, mirroring internal states without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve truths) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via audit exposure narrowing time/options to one-hour contingency. Agency in deciphering reflections forces trade-off (wading into water). Cost felt in sirens sweeping city, charging poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. indifference emerges organically via reappearing lagoon, unlocked histories; final image ("memories... weapons") reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of visibility. No moralizing; ambiguity in fragmented resistance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: biased noticing of "ghost-structures," "scattered codes" in stars. Lyrical rhythm modulates from tense escape to charged poise; no head-hopping, elision purposeful (tunnel details via action).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; "carefully resourceful" recurs purposefully as motif without loop. Minor paraphrase in reflection blocks ("carefully resourceful"), but integrated without dulling vault climax. Rhythm breathes at descent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Puddle-map as dusk contingency transforms dystopian escape trope via grandmother's code; auric lagoon's stubborn reappearance synthesizes revision motif originally. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes cleanly.</comment>
