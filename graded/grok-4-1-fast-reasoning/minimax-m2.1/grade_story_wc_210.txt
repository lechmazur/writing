<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in choice to forgo wishes shows via concrete rejection of healer's dream; contradictory impulses in embracing uncomfortable remembrance earn final smile and entry into new world.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as memories density-build to emergence; CR closure in "civilization reconceive itself... teach them to live without magic" lands with conceptual cost of harder path over resurrection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wet sand and porous amber constrain bottle ritual, charging final lanterns igniting without flame; sensory selection (echoing footsteps, cooling air) mirrors alchemist's purposeful isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of revival tightens via memory-pouring cadence shift narrowing to reimagination over resurrection; agency in kneeling and selective recall forecloses easy magic with felt discomfort cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance as foundation emerges implicitly from baker/weaver/blacksmith essences birthing new child; final image of Elias walking forward reweights wishes' exhaustion with non-literal endurance answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in alchemist's craft-attuned noticing (hands/fingers/arms emerging); rhythmic modulation builds from purposeful echo to charged poise in smile.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density in "shapes emerged... pale and unformed like a sketch drawn in fog" propels without loops; varied syntax breathes with ritual's uncomfortable expansion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-expansion transforms wish-exhaustion trope; bottle's paradoxical warmth inevitability heightens stakes through irreplaceable reimagination risk.</comment>
