<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's contradictory inheritance (father's mind without deceit) drives micro-choices like active waiting and honest rewriting, earning her realization with visible ethical cost. Final shift from rigid honor to fluid truth feels character-bound. No unearned epiphanies; embodied in hands-on prep work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflections and ink use builds to CR closure where Elena's equation reconfigures her premise, with cost in foreclosed rigidity legible in "resumed her work, writing...with something like peace." Orientation anchored early in prep room. One tightening via Darius's arrival suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ink pot and prep table constrain choices (writing asylum proof amid body prep) and charge final image with chrysanthemums beside it. Sensory details like "humming lights and quiet industry" filter through Elena's precision bias. Micro-setting guides solitude breach to intimate aid.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fair trade equation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as breach forces stance: rewrite as proof narrowing deception option. Agency in willed fluid writing; cost felt in ethical risk to her honesty, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of honest giving vs. conning emerges organically from ink's truth-revealing power, father's legacy, and unclaimed body; final chrysanthemums-by-inkpot reweights "take vs. give fairly" without statement. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (ledger-reading mind) biases details like ink's fluidity; rhythmic prose modulates from precise prep to fluid realization. Voice specificity in "thoughts moved differently—less rigid, more fluid" under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; no loops, though "rigid thinking" echoes purposefully. Rhythm breathes with scene (still prep to flowing write); final line recharges ink motif crisply. Minor figurative density in reflection block contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic-tinged ink in death-space forging asylum truth transforms tropes; risky "deathly vitality" and honest-con fusion feels inevitable in hindsight. Chrysanthemum closure inflects non-obviously from Darius's origin.</comment>
