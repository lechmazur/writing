<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Embodied emotions via soil under nails and freeze responses root motivation in trauma and talent; internal conflict in grief endurance vs. presence feels particular. Minor therapy-speak ("nervous system doing what it needed") abstracts peak freeze without full cost embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of routines builds to cereus CR closure with conceptual cost of impermanence. Orientation anchors early (lighthouse property post-wedding); one tightening via bloom reconfigures optimism premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse as micro-setting constrains choices (resurrecting plants) and charges final cereus image. Sensory details (salt-crusted glass, soil temperature) filter through POV priorities, evolving with grief weather.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchoring presence post-trauma) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via grief freezes to cereus deepening that crystallizes endurance. Cost legible in withering/survival realism foreclosing denial path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of realism-anchored optimism emerges from plant/grief particulars; cereus reprise non-literally answers trauma question, reweighting survival without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (plant pulses, somatic anchors); rhythmic control heightens quiet pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels reflection into action; minor paraphrase in grief descriptions ("freeze mid-motion") avoids loops but edges scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery via lighthouse/plants transforms survival trope; cereus "pearl" risks lyric boldness, heightening closure without gimmick.</comment>
