<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and trait-rooted in tinkerer's precision vs. loss, embodied in stopped clock metaphor; lacks on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or micro-choices under pressure to fully earn descent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density tightening to stairwell discovery; Charged Poise closure in "leaves could no longer follow her down" reconfigures quest isolation with legible cost of forsaking surface world.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Debris-crunching boots and mineral-damp air constrain cautious descent while charging final image; recurring leaves as micro-setting mirror deliberate patterns in chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant recovery stake signaled early deepens accumulatively via letter pursuit to stairwell commitment, narrowing options with environmental pressure; felt cost in irreversible plunge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Control vs. chaos theme emerges organically from gear-peace to leaf-patterns and final separation; resonant reconfiguration reweights planning premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature attuned to decay and patterns; rhythmic modulation builds immersion in descent without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel through vivid images like "rusted to the color of dried blood"; minor repetition of "neglected greenhouse" slightly dulls one transition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Horology-driven quest into greenhouse ruins transforms lost-family trope with textured inevitability; leaf patterns add fresh inflection to uncertainty.</comment>
