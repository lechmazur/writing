<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied ache ("chest ache") and contradictory impulses (destroy Engine vs. integrate), earning final renunciation; hypothesizing reveals flaws without safety-hedging. Minor slip in abstract labels like "bittersweet ache of partial understanding" borders on diagnostic but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from observations to egg's veins decoding as CR closure with conceptual cost (destruction foreclosed for symbiosis). Orientation anchored early ("suspended palace, vast cavern"); single scene tightens meaningfully via knowledge deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via sarcophagi guiding reverence and egg charging final image ("golden veins blazed"); sensory hierarchy (copper taste, whirring) mirrors organic-mechanical tension through POV. Micro-setting (egg) evolves causally, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kill-switch to end tyranny) deepens accumulatively to integration, agency in holding/decoding egg foreclosing destruction path with felt cost; one tightening via veins' clarity reweights options on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of symbiosis emerges organically from mechanical remnants to egg's message, final image ("sorrow and hope... reconciled into purpose") offers resonant CR without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "bitter compromise."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature via "hypothesizing... bittersweet ache"; rhythmic control modulates reverie to purpose, diction purposeful without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; figurative density ("mechanical flowers frozen mid-bloom") purposeful for textural lens, no loops or muddle, though minor overwriting in opening descriptors touches non-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical preservation and organic egg as symbiotic key transforms quest trope; risk in quiet CR heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight from hieroglyphs.</comment>
