<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sympathetic skeptic's interior contradiction shines in transcribing despite doubt, with micro-choice of pressing palm earning integration of skepticism and wonder as Charged Poise; embodied emotions via chest-loosening avoid labels. Final change forecloses pure certainty with felt softening cost. Minor therapy-speak edge in "practical architecture of her adult mind" doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from tile discovery to memory chain, culminating in on-page CR at palm press where memories "taking and giving" reconfigure stance with conceptual cost of softened certainty. Orientation anchored early in tower climb. One tightening via transcription suffices; no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tower's open roof channels whale songs into transcription beat, constraining reflection; whales paint dawn final image, charging closure. Sensory selectivity (salt winds, mournful calls) reflects skeptic's priorities. Micro-setting tile/tower evolves tactilely (cool stone, palm press).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (measure vs deeper truth) signaled in doubt, tightens accumulatively through memory layering narrowing options to add voice; agency in urgent transcription forecloses dismissal. Cost legible in "betray myself" refusal integrated. Escalation coherent under lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of doubt-wonder emerges organically from tile particulars, resonant CR in dawn palm press reweighting measurement premise without moral; "skepticism remains... companion in wonder" answers via image, not statement. Ambiguity lingers in chorus complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature of cramped precision softening to fluidity; diction/rhythm modulate from cataloging to "current through a river." No head-hopping or withholding; voice embodies skeptic via measured syntax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm (short urgent transcription sentences to flowing memory chains); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—"choir of voices" purposeful. Minor register elevation in "technology of memory" fits but nudges from 9.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skeptic + memory tile + whale chorus transforms threshold trope; tile's grid patterns yield inevitable entangled payoff. Risk in lyric accumulative closure heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
