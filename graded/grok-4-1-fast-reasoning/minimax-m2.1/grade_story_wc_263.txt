<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong interior conflict between grasping and surrender, embodied in aching body and biting astrolabe; final stillness earned by prior desperation. Diagnostic statements like "creativity could not be seized. It had to be surrendered to" tell the epiphany, softening embodied earning at pivotal shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: stillness builds density to pattern break via meteor and warming astrolabe. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands on-page with felt cost of prior struggle legible in "creative imprisonment crack... pour forth."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Astrolabe as micro-setting constrains choices (held, laid, warms) and charges final image. Sensory details (aurora fire, cold stone, winds) filtered through POV urgency, mirroring internal blur to clarity; environment guides surrender.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free creativity) signaled early; one tightening via stillness cadence shift under Accumulative lens narrows to surrender, foreclosing grasping path with cost of "sleepless weeks." Agency in listening reweights options legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of surrender emerges organically from grasping-to-stillness arc and shifting images (stardust dormant to rising). Final image offers resonant non-literal answer without moral; minor directness in grandmother's recalled voice slightly undercuts subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (aurora as words, winds' whispers); rhythmic prose modulates from frantic blur to luminous poise. Lyrical diction consistent, biased to dreamer's cosmic lens under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("remembered stardust") as motif; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting in stacked figures during peak ("ice beginning to give way under spring sunlight") risks muddle, but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of writer's block via astrolabe, aurora, stardust into surrender arc; meteor realization feels inevitable from established pattern. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
