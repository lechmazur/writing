<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cool-headed fisher's patience roots motivation, embodied in loose grip on spike and zigzag choices under pressure; interiority concrete via spike's warmth transliterating grief/hope; final endurance carrying goddess's echo forecloses noisy paths with personal cost, earning change without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from visible ripples to resonant zigzag to silence's absence capturing echo; orientation anchored early (Morwen post-storm at garden); closure as RR/Charged Poise lands on-page with spike's luminescence and lifted weight as felt cost in final transliteration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden's crystalline spires and humming ground constrain zigzag choices; synesthetic details (concentric light rings, visible vibrations) filter through fisher's sensory patience; recurring spike charges final image, mirroring internal states via causal evolution without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch echo via silence) signaled early, tightens accumulatively: others' noise scatters, his stillness slows waves, zigzag resonates, climax voices absence; agency in micro-choices forecloses grasping path; cost legible in spike's/reconfigured self's weight lifted amid constellations' thanks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stillness mastering broken patterns emerges organically from spike's transliteration and zigzag resonance, not statement; final image of fishing echoes offers non-literal reconfiguration of chaos-into-song without moral; subtext in silence's weight invites ambiguity on divine remnants.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: fisher's patient noticing of ripples slowing into gather like water; rhythmic prose modulates from humming complexity to hollow absence; synesthetic diction biased toward tactile hums and visible song coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "silence had weight" advances stakes/character/atmosphere); varied rhythm propels from exploratory beats to climax's "not a sound at all"; zero loops, coherent metaphors (wet paper tear, sleepwalking stars), flawless propulsion to luminous closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic garden transforms fisher tropes via spike's emotion-metal conversion and voicing silence; non-obvious echo-capture via absence feels inevitable from pattern breaks; bold risks in visible sound/feral sky cohere without gimmickry, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
