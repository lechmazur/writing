<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara's micro-choices like kneeling for the brass disk reveal curiosity rooted in traits; interiority concrete via equations but slips into diagnostic labels like "functionally creative" without embodied contradiction. Final endurance of stoic renewal feels earned by prior mappings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discovery density builds to CR closure in "sediment swirl away in dark ribbons" with felt cost of time (17 days/6 weeks). Orientation anchored early; one tightening from mapping to proposal narrows options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport's "hollow ribcage" and ruptured pipe constrain choices via sediment blockages; sextant charges final image as navigational survivor. Sensory hierarchy (echoing boots, crushed grass) reflects engineer's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore terminal) signaled early, deepens via aquifer calculations forcing trade-off of time vs. hope; agency in council proposal crystallizes stance with legible cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of renewal from "maze of intentions" emerges via particulars like sextant pulse and water ribbons; final image reweights abandonment premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in engineering lens ("cycling through equations"); rhythmic modulation builds texture without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (echoing boots propel descent, swirling ribbons close); minor density slip in stacked metaphors like "ghost of music" but no loops obscure closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of derelict spaceport as hope via redirected flows transforms trope; risk in quiet CR heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
