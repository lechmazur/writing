<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's boredom as blind spot drives patient carrying of amulet and raising it under storm, with embodied weariness ("cold against the永恒 of his skin") showing contradictory search amid exhaustion; final readiness earned through buildup. Minor slip in diagnostic articulation of realization ("the question had never been about death") borders unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of prismatic fractures and magnetic pulses builds to CR closure ("Elian saw... the weight of existence was released") with conceptual cost legible in final image of doorway beyond separation; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite vividly sensory (hum, blinding ribbons, shivering fabric) and evolves causally with storm, constraining choice to raise amulet amid tears; recurring amulet charges final blaze, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth of goodbye) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density of spatial rebellion forcing stance crystallization in realization; cost felt in foreclosed boredom, one tightening sufficient, agency in patient wait and raise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of goodbye as translation emerges organically from amulet vision and spatial imagery, resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing; final image ("hellos in a language older than stars") non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (dimensional glimpses as "ten thousand ways"), rhythmic diction modulates from weary to peak blaze; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm accelerates to climax, specifics like "magnetic fields dance in patterns" propel; figurative density in peak ("wounds in reality... salt in storm-tossed water") risks overwrite but pattern-consistent, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of immortal ennui with spatial mutiny and solar convergence transforms trope via prismatic physics; risk-taking in CR closure ("goodbye... hellos") inevitable from particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
