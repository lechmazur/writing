<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via hearing "spaces between sounds" and embodied grief in raw first note; micro-choices like placing bowl reveal values under pressure; final endurance of "beautifully, terribly unfinished" grief earned with visible conceptual cost, satisfying 9+ test despite solo POV limiting relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as notes accumulate density to interrupt hush; on-page Charged Poise closure in "world beginning to breathe again" with legible conceptual cost (hush persists, unfinished); oriented early via wreckage walk; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shipwrecks constrain acoustics for violinist's choices and charge final "echo-harbor answered," satisfying 9+ test; sensory hierarchy (drip as "small bell") reflects perceptual bias; details evolve causally (blackened branches to new grass); lived-in via violin case clutched "like something precious."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unbind hush signaled early, tightens texturally via stutter to breathing; agency in raw note pushing "like a hand reaching from a well" forecloses total silence with felt interruption cost; single decisive accumulation sufficient, legible under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in unfinished emerges organically from playing for "trees that would not bloom" and "stubborn beauty"; final image of bowl as "promise kept across generations" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting devastation; no moralizing, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in acoustical details like echoes "shifted with wind and tide"; rhythmic control modulates from searching note to accumulated chorus; diction purposeful and biased, no elision issues; 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with lines like "notes accumulated, building something from nothing" advancing multiple layers; varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; coherent metaphors (hush "stutter"); propulsion peaks cleanly at closure without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eco-devastation via "echo-harbor violinist" and bowl resonance transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; non-obvious unbinding through music feels inevitable; 9+ test met with hindsight inevitability.</comment>
