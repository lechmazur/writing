<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via squeaking shoes and whorls of wood grain; contradictory impulses (prior delusion dismissal vs. felt presence) yield earned realization at poem recitation, foreclosing denial with eternal carving cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as ribbon unrolling and poem speaking densify meditative pattern toward CR closure; butterfly ascent image makes before/after legible with conceptual cost of communal grief acceptance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse's moss table and flagstone constrain meditative retracing; dusk amber and monarch whine charge final butterfly cloud image, mirroring reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake signaled in opening promise tightens via recitation amid dusk pressure under accumulative lens; agency in speaking poem forecloses delusion path with felt cost of redefined carvings.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Grief's "shape" emerges via butterfly migration as weather-like movement; final image reweights ribbon poems and epitaph without moralizing, resonant from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with carver-biased perceptual signature (patience in chisels, whorls); rhythmic modulation from meditative hush to charged poise at "thundering calm."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds, high density in lines like "silk whispering against itself"; varied rhythm propels to closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carver inheritance and migratory grief metaphor; risky lyric CR heightens stakes via butterfly/grandmother convergence without gimmickry.</comment>
