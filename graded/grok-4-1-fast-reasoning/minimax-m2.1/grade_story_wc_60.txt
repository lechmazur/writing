<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. trail-following) shown in embodied glow shifts and cataloguing; final transformation earned by patient unsticking without epiphany dump. Micro-choices reveal values hierarchy, like sitting with sidereal patience at first fountain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with breadcrumb pattern tightening via theory at fifth fountain; CR closure lands cleanly in final unstick and marker-leaving with conceptual cost of transformed skepticism. Orientation anchored early (Mira, fountains, geese); no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring fountains constrain trail choices and evolve (algae, sediment); sensory hierarchy (phosphorescence, emotional whispers) filters via skeptic POV, charging final empty-box image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate memories) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through breadcrumb instructions and theory-deepening; agency in unsticking forecloses doubt path with patience cost legible in dusk image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of understanding over solving emerges organically from breadcrumb pursuit and memory release; final image reweights premise via Mira's marker-leaving without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with luminous perceptual signature (glow as emotion barometer); rhythmic control modulates lyric density to pressure peaks, like prismatic shadows on approach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful metaphors (memories as fog/insects) integrate without muddle, propelling to charged dusk closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skeptic-liberator premise via phosphorescent trail transforms mystery tropes; risk in sidereal patience frame heightens stakes inevitably toward CR.</comment>
