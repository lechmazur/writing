<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied calm and micro-choices like ladder-climbing despite weakness reveal endurance under death's shadow; motivation to continue work feels earned through lineage and diary. Minor weakness: internal conflict leans reflective summary over simultaneous impulses in pivotal wrapping beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of observations tightening to Charged Poise closure; final wind-as-gratitude image reconfigures death-as-transition with felt cost of unseen full flowering. Orientation anchored early in orchard pillars; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like moss-warm pillars and copper-wired oaks constrain choices (ladder, wire path) and charge final stirring branches; POV-filtered through botanical priorities avoids catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of remodeling despite diagnosis signaled early, escalates texturally via deepening integrations to acceptance; one tightening in wire-as-language forecloses reduced workload path with mortality cost legible throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies listening emerges organically from particulars like pillar-root designs; final image offers resonant non-literal answer—wind music as gratitude—reweighting death without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature (spiraling vines, sacred geometry); rhythmic modulation builds to calm intensity, elisions purposeful and anchored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels reflective accumulations; minor conceptual loops in "conversation" motif purposeful, not obscuring closure image of wind-stirred branches.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of copper as tree-language and living architecture transforms eco-spiritual tropes; risk in death-calm poise heightens stakes organically.</comment>
