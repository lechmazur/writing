<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Keeper's loose grip and witnessing motivation feel particular and embodied through impressions like "hands passed through the fabric of moments," earning the final endurance as more feeling than form. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, leaning declarative over conflicted micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from library decay to refuge silence to existential rhythm; closure as Charged Poise in final image of swan in lap reconfigures presence with conceptual cost of dissolution. Orientation anchored early in catacombs; no shards exceed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Obsidian walls absorbing light and dripping water corners constrain perception and charge regenerative healing; swan recurs tactilely to enable passage and final poise. Sensory selection purposeful, mirroring internal loosening without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of patient witnessing accumulates via refuge deepening, narrowing to endurance with felt cost of self-dissolution; one cadence shift suffices under textural lens. Pressure coherent but internal/static, lacking agency-driven turn to fully foreclose options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of decay-as-completion emerges implicitly from crumbling library/refuge interplay, final image resonating as non-literal answer to clinging vs. loosening without moral. Complexity in peace's dual nutrient/silence yields lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature biases toward transformative impressions like "silence knew precisely what needed repair"; rhythmic syntax modulates reflective intensity purposefully. No head-hopping; elisions (e.g., pilgrim backstory) anchor to present swan cue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops in "crumbling peace" restatements dull mid-section momentum without payoff. Figurative layering consistent/voice-motivated, no muddle at closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of composted knowledge, swan portal, and regenerative silence transforms decay tropes into inevitable existential poise; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes organically.</comment>
