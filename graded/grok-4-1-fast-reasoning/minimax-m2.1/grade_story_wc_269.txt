<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in past bleaching helplessness, embodied in automatic tapping that breaks at revelation ("She stopped tapping"), earning her new pattern with felt cost of abandoning seven-year habit. Interiority concrete via sensory tics like finger-tracing atlas. Minor slip: subtle internal contradiction more implied than simultaneous.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: data density builds to CR closure in final tapping/waiting image, reweighting paths as transformed ("The paths had not simply disappeared. They had transformed") with cost of rhythm's rupture legible on page. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Station as micro-setting constrains via console-tapping and buoy signals, charging final image; atlas page recurs to mirror internal shift. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (currents over visuals). Environment evolves with data, guiding new taps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (path regeneration) signaled early, tightens via unexpected coral data forcing new tapping pattern under Accumulative lens, narrowing to Charged Poise with cost of "waking from a dream." Agency in rhythm invention; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically from data realization and atlas trace, final image ("drifting at her station that was neither here nor there") offering non-literal reweighting of disappearance premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable with perceptual signature (rhythms as communication, maps as "photographs of temporary truths"); diction/rhythm modulate from measured to improvisational at revelation. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short declarative peaks like "She stopped tapping"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Propulsion aligns with data arrival; closure image crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-ban coral scout colony via rerouted currents transforms eco-trope; tapping evolution and "periodically eternal" angle feel inevitable from particulars. Quiet lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
