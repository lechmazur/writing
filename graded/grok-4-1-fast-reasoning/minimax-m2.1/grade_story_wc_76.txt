<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through clock-making lens; motivation intensifies via death vision cueing yoyo choice, earning defiance with annihilation cost. Contradictory impulses in resolve vs. stone's warning act simultaneously pre-climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from stone/yoyo analysis to reality-unwinding closure (CR) with conceptual cost in "fate finally written in a language that had no past tense." Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (salt/sawdust, cold string) filter through inventive POV; lighthouse/yoyo constrain choices, stone charges final submerged image mirroring irrelevance of warnings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy fate) signaled early, tightens via yoyo click narrowing to liberation/annihilation trade-off under Accumulative lens. Agency in tracing patterns/spinning forecloses forward-time path with legible cost in dissolving world.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of reversal vs. fate emerges organically from particulars (backward clocks, yoyo light); final collapsing image reconfigures premise without moralizing, offering resonant CR on time's unmaking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (time/gear metaphors); rhythmic diction modulates to compression in climax ("pure potential rather than predetermined outcome"). No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to closure; minor figurative density ("shadows backward") in peak beat purposeful and coherent, no loops or scaffolds dulling image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of backward clocks/yoyo reversal transforms fate trope; risk in reality-dissolution heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early inventions.</comment>
