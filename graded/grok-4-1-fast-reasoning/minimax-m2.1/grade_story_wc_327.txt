<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in ancestral curse compels descent and speech; diamond's warmth embodies internal drive. Final endurance of burden earns reconfiguration, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in climax beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of echoes, patterns, and realizations; closure as Charged Poise in tunnel speech reconfigures curse with "gave everything" cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel and bone towers constrain path and hum accumulated sound, charging final bird response; sensory details like "dust of forgotten pronunciations" filter through Elara's pattern-seeing bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to harness language death tightens texturally via bird helix and elder songs; her articulation forecloses prior failure paths, but trade-off less sharp than ancestral weight alone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of texture-to-sound translation emerges via dying syllables and new language birth; final helix-mirroring image offers resonant CR reweighting meaning without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in "living calligraphy" and sound-between-spaces; rhythmic modulation builds echo density to closure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action with no loops; figurative abundance like "throat" and "ribs" coherent, but early overload slightly slows propulsion before tunnel sharpening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of 17 bird-words, cursed diamond refraction, and echo tunnel births inevitable new language; risk in lyric texture heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
