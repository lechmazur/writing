<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Thalassor's internal conflict between rigid guardianship and emerging nuance acts simultaneously through embodied stone perceptions and telepathic shifts; final renunciation of certainty feels earned by ampoule-triggered revelations. Contradictory impulses peak in welcoming the diver without warning. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like past "incisively kind" judgments drive compassionate evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelations cascade in density, breaking certainty patterns toward CR closure where "keeper of questions instead of answers" reconfigures purpose with conceptual cost of dissolved beliefs. Orientation anchored by ~50 words in Veluna garden. Single scene, no shards; cost legible in "dissolving the rigid architecture of his beliefs".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Underwater garden vividly selective (kelp forests, fish in ribcage, brine light), mirroring contradictions and charging final image of thriving system. Sensory hierarchy fits stone telepathy; anemones/coral constrain realization of nuance. No white-room; details evolve with revelations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (embrace nuance vs certainty) signaled early, escalates via deepening revelations that narrow guardian role; agency in shifting telepathy to curiosity forecloses protection path. Accumulative tightening reweights with cost in self-redefinition. Minor abstractness in fish inquiries slightly mutes visceral price before diver.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Foxglove dual nature and garden contradictions organically yield theme of nuance over certainty; final image of faded ampoule multiplies secret without moralizing. Resonant CR reweights premise via lived particulars, inviting ambiguity. No sermonizing; subtext in telepathic presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with stone-specific perceptual signature (telepathy as currents, souls in pores); rhythmic prose modulates from stasis to flow. Lyrical diction purposeful, no head-hopping. Voice reflects evolving consciousness without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (cascading waves, thread unraveled) without muddle in peak revelation beats. Propulsion builds accumulatively; minor overwriting in garden listings ("anemones...coral...fish") slightly slows one transition but misses closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of soul-accumulated statue and memory-ampoule premise transforms guardian trope via conceptual foxglove truth; risk in lyric CR pays off with inevitable hindsight shift. No derivatives; bold lifeless animation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
