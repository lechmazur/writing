<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in hands "remembering" the lion and contradictory impulses of holding/letting go enacted through chisel work; final endurance in picking up chisel earned by prior micro-choices like ignoring kettle. No safety-hedging flaws; grief's "hollow places" held practically. Diagnostic phrasing ("haunting practicality of grief") borders epiphany but anchors in action without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: carving shavings build density from blank to mane/eyes, culminating in Charged Poise RR where lion "watches...here" reconfigures grief with cost (cold kettle, fading light as felt price). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent, no shards/transitions needed. Closure cost legible in "the work was love...no difference, and there was all the difference."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Skylight rain beads, ash shavings pile, and chisel constrain choices (works "through the rain...through the ache") and charge final image (light blade glows loft "rust-hued"); sensory hierarchy (fragrant shavings, metallic whistle) POV-biased to widow's priorities. Selective, purposeful integration mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Evolving details (whistle to silence, light dying/returning) causal with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contain grief via carving) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as mane emerges/"familiar and strange," narrowing to endurance with deepening knowledge (eyes "last thing to live"); cost visible in ignored kettle/tea and "holding the hollow places." Agency in persistent micro-choices forces stance crystallization. One decisive cadence shift sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (love transforms via containment) emerges organically from carving progression and images (shavings as "whispers," lion as "his face and not"); final image offers resonant non-literal answer ("lion kept watching...here") reweighting "here and gone." Lessons list borders statement but interleaves with action; ambiguity lingers in "wild and gentle...equal measure."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Close third POV stable, perceptual signature in biased noticing (rain "hesitant paths," grain "rise under her pad"); rhythmic modulation accelerates with carving ("each strand a small decision") and breathes in reflections. Prose texture distinct: lyrical syntax reflects meditative mind under grief's pressure. No elision or head-hopping; inference matches knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (advance carving/emotion/atmosphere) with varied rhythm/openings; purposeful repetition (rain/shavings "patient conversation") taught early, no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives coherent ("crystallized time," "harvesting lessons") without muddle in peak (mane touch). Propulsion peaks in final blade of light; clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lion tamer's widow carves grief into "companion" cage/embrace, transforming circus trope via ash wood's "slow turning of loss into form." Bold lyric risk (reflective stasis as closure) heightens stakes organically; no hedging, inevitable hindsight from hands "remembering." Non-obvious moral calculus on taming/containing.</comment>
