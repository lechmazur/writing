<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and pattern-focused motivation drive Mira's competent endurance, with the engineer's patch anchoring her expertise; realization feels earned without epiphany dump. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits to strong but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations build to convergence-point CR closure ("some accidents were not accidents at all"), with legible cost in predictive foresight; single scene oriented early, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Containers and fog constrain choices (anemometer in wind tunnels) and charge final image of perimeter survey; sensory hierarchy (wind howls, particulate density) reflects Mira's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover freighter accident pattern) tightens accumulatively at amphitheater vortex, narrowing to realization with conceptual cost; agency in methodical advance coheres pressure without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hidden mathematics demanding payment emerges organically from wind-pattern particulars, resonant in final survey image without statement; complexity in "not accidents at all" invites rereading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with perceptual signature (air leaves fingerprints) modulates rhythm under fog's haze; diction precise-technical, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and integrated sensory propulsion; minor pattern repetition ("patterns") doesn't obscure closure image of bolts rattling loose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wind-vortex "weapon" from container architecture transforms disaster trope; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable CR without gimmick.</comment>
