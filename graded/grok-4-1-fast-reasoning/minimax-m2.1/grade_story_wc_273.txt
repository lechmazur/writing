<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Albino tracker's serene anger as contradictory impulse (cold fire without flame) acts in scene, embodied in smile and fingertip touch; final choice to enter ink patterns earned by prior crisis backstory and ink-reading expertise, with cost of potential disappearance legible. No stock phrasing; traits shown through perception and micro-choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ink observation builds density to cadence shift at touch ("world began to dissolve"), delivering Charged Poise CR where tracker fades into time-between-moments with conceptual cost (becoming mystery like Vasquez). Single scene oriented early (~50 words); no ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Wind-carved encampment and moving ink constrain intrusion and charge final image (encampment holds breath, settles to silence as drone hovers over empty space). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (humming frequency only he hears, sensitized fingertips); details evolve causally with glow and fade.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover time-slowing via ink) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as patterns glow/thin time, forcing endurance choice to touch despite warnings; cost felt in body fade and three-days-lost parallel. Agency in reaching out narrows options under lens; no reversal needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of crisis-time dilation and universe's chaotic rules emerges from ink patterns/prior mine crisis, reweighted non-literally in final expansion "into the space between moments where time moved like honey." Resonance from particulars avoids morals; serene anger complicates without tidy resolve.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (albino-sensitized eyes/fingertips on ephemeral ink); rhythmic modulation builds to lyrical compression at fade ("consciousness expanding"). Voice texture distinct in syntax/word choice (e.g., "consciously wild intelligence"); no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Purposeful lyric rhythm varies but overwriting with stacked metaphors/figurations in peak ("time moved like honey," "serene, angry smile" reprise) reduces density in fade beat (-0.8 non-closure cap); minor paraphrase loops ("patterns" churn, "serene anger" x3). Propulsion strong overall, no scaffold obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ink as temporal language/portal with albino perception transforms time-dilation trope; risk in lyric dissolution inevitable from established patterns, heightening stakes without gimmick. No derivatives; particular details (hummingbird recording void) memorable.</comment>
