<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via river stone's tactile memory contrasting unbound ether; self-reflection in archived footage earns endurance with memory-gap cost, though micro-choices remain observational rather than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through footage comparisons; charged poise closure crystallizes vigil in final line's "preserving the shape of hope," reweighting transformation with luminous regret cost legible in "studying their own reflection."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blooming library's ether blossoms and dream-frames constrain tactile absence, charging final swaying image; stone as micro-setting anchors embodiment amid abstraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Preservation stake signaled early tightens texturally at personal footage pause, narrowing grounded vs. unbound hope; cost felt in warming stone and regret halo foreclosing tactile past.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hope's unbound radiance emerges via old/new contrasts; final vigil image reconfigures Unbinding as radiant loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature in "sharp eyes catching... hope accumulated in corners" sustains bias; rhythmic modulation heightens reflective pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action seamlessly; minor "hope" paraphrase loops across mutations, but purposeful under textural lens without closure dulling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Unbinding premise synthesizes dream-archiving with personal residue boldly; cloud library transforms post-human tropes into inevitable preservation calculus.</comment>
