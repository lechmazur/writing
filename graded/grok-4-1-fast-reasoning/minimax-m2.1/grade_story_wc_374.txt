<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (skepticism warring with bioluminescent senses and tastes) act vividly in scene, earning Mira's final perceptual shift; Seren applies precise pressure via weather embodiment. Interiority particular (compass tasting as skeptical inquiry). Final renunciation of pure doubt carries visible cost in altered flavor perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory densities (aurora intensification, taste shifts) build to CR closure where wonder reweights skepticism with conceptual cost legible in "taste like possibility." Orientation anchored early (bluff, aurora, forests). Single tightening via Seren's arrival narrows doubt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora and lavender bluff constrain choices (descent releases scent mirroring internal convergence) and charge final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (ozone taste precedes Seren). World rules (tree elections, bioluminescence) learned via hum and glow without dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why weather carriers?) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via compass taste → Seren convergence → deepened realization. Agency in descent/questioning forecloses skeptical isolation with felt perceptual cost. No reversals needed; cadence shift reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (skepticism requires wonder) emerges organically from tasting convergence and Seren's clouds-in-smile; final CR image ("presence of wonder") resonates non-literally, reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in implied weather kinship avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (taste-filtered synesthesia, glow-uncertainty) biases noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks in "mouth flooded with... ozone-sweet." Dialogue subtextual (Seren's thunder-voice pursues revelation). Stable single POV, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "needle didn't point north... truth slipped through" advances plot/atmosphere/theme). Varied rhythm, no loops; purposeful figurative density taught early pays in aurora-compass convergence without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tasting convergence bridges sci-fi weather carriers and tree democracy into inevitable CR; transforms skepticism trope via bioluminescent embodiment. Risky lyric texture heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
