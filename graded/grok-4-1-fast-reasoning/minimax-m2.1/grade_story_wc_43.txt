<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with her diagnosis sharpening micro-choices like using the vinyl shard; contradictory impulses emerge subtly in her earned serenity against grief. Margery applies relational pressure via grip and dialogue. Minor epiphanic summary ("strange clarity") prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from objects to humming to final grip as Charged Poise, reconfiguring shared mortality with felt cost in "pulsing stillness embraces them both." Orientation anchored early; one tightening suffices. Cost legible in vinyl's reprise as "small golden moon."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vinyl shard and room's amber light constrain choices (struck rhythms, caught sun) and charge closure image; sensory hierarchy (scent, light, rasped voice) reflects Elara's priorities. City view softens chaos purposefully. 9+ gate met via recurring object's closure tie.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reunify via mundane sacred) signaled early, deepens accumulatively as Elara's mortality narrows her touch; humming settles Margery's breath as tightening with agency. Grip crystallizes stance; cost felt in foreclosed time. No 8.8+ as pressure subtly rather than viscerally forces trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of broken beauty singing emerges organically from vinyl, objects, humming; final grip/image answers "flawless goodbye" non-literally, reweighting ordinary as eternal. No moralizing; ambiguity in shared journey lingers. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("sacred frequencies," "architecture of grace"); rhythmic modulation peaks in final "pulsing stillness." Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("You're not just humming"). No head-hopping; 9+ perceptual control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel accumulatively; minor elevated diction ("hymning the mundane") voice-fit, no loops or muddle in peak humming/grip. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene. Slight overwrite in reflective blocks prevents 9+.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of junk-drawer therapy transforming hospice trope; vinyl relic's evolution from grief token to luminous moon risks lyric mode successfully. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals without hedging.</comment>
