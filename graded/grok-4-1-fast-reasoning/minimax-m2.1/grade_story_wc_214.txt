<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Poetic interiority anchors motivation in curiosity and empathy, shown through kneeling and tracing with the fragment, but lacks contradictory impulses or flaws complicating choices—no genuine struggle emerges beyond serene realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build from general tracing to fragment-specific vision; CR closure lands in final image of carrying to recycling fires, reweighting endings as seeds with legible conceptual cost of loss accepted.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Yellow lantern glass as recurring object constrains tracing action and charges refracted rainbows moment, filtering cosmic setting through POV's luminous fingerprints; vivid hush and celestial currents evolve purposefully without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of empathic witnessing signaled early tightens via fragment discovery and vision, deepening under textural lens to foreclose blazing certainty for vulnerable openness; quiet cost felt in star's "no longer having to burn."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of strength in vulnerability emerges organically from tracing and handling, resonating in final "quiet fire that burned in gentle hands" without moralizing; subtext layers light/loss through concrete images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice delivers distinct perceptual signature—noticing stars' "voices, a memory"—with rhythmic modulation from slow immersion to reverent lift; stable single POV, purposeful elevation suits cosmic curiosity without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "glass caught the faint light and refracted it into a hundred small rainbows"; purposeful repetitions ("flourishing stillness") build texture without loops dulling closure, though minor abstract drift in epiphanies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh cosmic janitor premise transforms stellar tropes into empathic ritual, with fragment vision as earned reweighting; bold lyric risk on overlooked detritus heightens stakes through specific vulnerability calculus.</comment>
