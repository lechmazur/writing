<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via landscape-reading instincts and embodied sundial weight; motivation to decode lies drives micro-choices like sundial use, earning final realization without epiphany shortcuts. Contradictory impulses subtle in patient seeking vs. deliberate obfuscation awareness. Final steering reveals values hierarchy with implied endurance cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fragments to CR closure in "serene upheaval... settled into her bones" with conceptual cost of inverted time-perspective. Orientation anchored early (barge, canal, twilight); one tightening via gnomon shadow yielding Konstantýn insight. No causality breaks; cost legible in patient reconstruction vs. erasure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sundial as micro-setting constrains choice (marks "hour that had passed three centuries ago") and charges final image; canal walls' "older construction beneath modern repairs" guides steering. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (black glass water, amber lamps via legend-seeker lens). Atmosphere tensions serene seeking with obscured history.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unearth erased canal) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via sundial realization narrowing to barge steering; agency in instincts-driven navigation forecloses aimless drift. Cost felt in "quiet accumulation... patient reconstruction." Lens-coherent pressure, but external opposition off-page limits visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of lies' architecture emerges organically from maps' erasure and sundial's etched truth, reweighted in final "time that refused to stay hidden" without statement. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; ambiguity in Konstantýn's role invites reflection. Protagonist arc inextricable from seeking's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (history "pressed most heavily against the present"); stable close-third POV modulates rhythmically from descriptive hush to propulsive steering. Compression purposeful, syntax reflects seeking mind; no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "gnomon cast a precise line... marking an hour that had passed three centuries ago" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent (twilight as "held breath"); zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of antiquarian seeking and erased geography transformed via sundial's inverted time-reading; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes without gimmick. Core premise (myth-seed excavation) feels inevitable from particulars, no template echoes.</comment>
