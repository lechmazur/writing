<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's diligently curious nature drives consistent micro-choices like racing to the hold and working through exhaustion, with embodied emotions (heart quickening, eyes burning). Internal progression layers warmth with isolation effectively. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations build density to CR closure: discovery crystallized by dawn with legible cost ("eyes burning," "pencil worn to a stub"). Orientation anchored early in airship cabin. Single scene with spatial moves coheres cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Airship rigging traps luminance, constraining observation and charging final image; hopscotch board as micro-setting mirrors patterns, guiding choices. Sensory details (creaking timbers, chronometer) selective and POV-biased. Hopscotch integration elevates to 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart discovery) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via luminance spotting and board cross-reference, narrowing to all-night work with visible cost (exhaustion). One deepening suffices; agency in persistent noting coherent under lens. No reversal but textural intensification strong.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sociable isolation theme emerges organically from crew interruption and solo vigil, resonating in final image of captured secret amid morning routines. Patterns (birds/board) reweight discovery without moralizing. Quiet CR answers charting question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with cartographer's perceptual signature (measuring angles, noting proportions). Prose rhythm modulates from meditative to urgent ("scrambled for her spyglass"). Brief dialogue natural, subtextual, goal-driven with Bren.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "stranded luminance that should have dissipated but instead seemed trapped"); rhythmic variety, no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful (murmuration as "living shadow," "pulsed like a heartbeat"). Zero artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of starlings mirroring hopscotch via luminance transforms steampunk tropes into navigational encoding. Risky lyric accumulation of patterns feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening discovery stakes organically.</comment>
