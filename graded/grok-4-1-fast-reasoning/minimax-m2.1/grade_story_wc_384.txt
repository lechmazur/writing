<question>1</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Yuki's interiority is concrete and particular, embodied in brushstrokes tying grandmother's teachings to restoration; final unlinking earned via patient work. Archive Keeper applies precise pressure via thorn and key. Minor abstract diagnostic phrasing like "wisest enduring form of courage" slightly distances embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to dawn realization. Closure as CR lands on-page—"She left... carrying... knowledge... too dangerous"—with conceptual cost of intangible burden over physical docs, reweighting preservation. Orientation anchored early in sanctuary/aurora; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Marble sanctuary, aurora ("pearl twilight"), stalactites constrain time/intention, charging final wall crumble and departure image. Sensory selection (drips as heartbeats, shifting ribbons) POV-filtered via Yuki's restorative gaze. Micro-objects (thorn, key) guide choices.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (restore truth vs. erasure) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through night work to wall/intention turn narrowing to knowledge carry-off. Agency in skill/intention forecloses physical transport with felt danger cost. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of restoration as forgiveness emerges from particulars (brushstrokes pardoning silenced stories); final image—"placed the heritage rose thorn beside... promise that... would bloom again"—resonantly reweights treason-to-truth without moral state. Organic via conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (drips as "patient measure," lights as "ribbons"); stable single-POV distance modulates intensity. Keeper's dialogue natural/subtextual. Rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density, varied rhythm; purposeful motifs avoid loops. Minor overwrite in dense figuratives ("calligraphy forger... crude... delicate art") but coherent, not muddling closure. Propulsion aligns with patient accumulation.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: forgery as unlinking/forgiveness in aurora sanctuary retransforms treason trope via intention-key/wall. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; bold conceptual arc heightens stakes.</comment>
