<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's interiority shines in concrete micro-choices like tuning beyond training to the silence, with embodied weeping as felt cost. Method (discarding assumptions) roots motivation consistently, driving the intuitive shift. Minor slip: epiphany borders unearned without stronger contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: signal chaos densifies to geometric silence growing into invitation, culminating in on-page CR (realization of universal rhythm) with legible emotional cost ("She wept"). Orientation anchored early (Mara scaling tower during perigee). Single scene tightens meaningfully without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting filters through POV priorities: swaying hut, wind-fueled creaks constrain positioning, while fragment as micro-setting pulses to charge climax and final descent image ("tower creaked... like a ship returning to harbor"). Sensory hierarchy vivid and selective, mirroring internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch perigee signals) signaled early; textural deepening via silence's growth forces agency shift (tunes to it), narrowing to realization with visible cost (wept, new burden to explore). Pressure coheres under lens to Charged Poise at ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (beginnings in endings) emerges organically from signal patterns and hush's invitation, reweighted in CR without statement—"every farewell carried... new hello" resonates non-literally. Final image (descent with understanding) answers central question via particulars, inviting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: interpreter's bias toward signal silences and resonances. Prose texture distinct—lyric rhythm modulates from chaos to serenity. No elision or head-hopping; diction fits grounded-fantasy lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer sensory chaos and hush without loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies naturally ("knife through water," "serenely electric" purposeful, not muddled). Closure image clean, no artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Hollywood star as cosmic amplifier transforms tropes into textural drive toward hush-realization. Risky lyric ascent/descent frame heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
