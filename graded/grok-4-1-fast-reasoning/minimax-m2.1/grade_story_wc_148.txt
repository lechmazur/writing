<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in inheritance intensifies through micro-choices like pressing palm to door; embodied emotion via "stone in his chest." Limited contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene caps higher score; resolute arc earns change without strong internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure: Marcus speaks words, reconfiguring silence into sustained story. Cost legible in "refusing to let them end" amid chosen imprisonment; persistent lattice constraint shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Door scuffs and lattice constrain entry ("pressed his palm against those marks") and charge chamber kneeling. Sensory hierarchy (copperlight repose, grain grooves) filters via POV history bias; spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (speak buried truth) deepens texturally via lattice glow to kneeling/speaking turn, narrowing to endurance with isolation cost. Agency in "stepped fully into the chamber"; one tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of disbelieved truth emerges via lattice/whisper particulars, reweighted in final "speak the truth until the truth believed in itself." Resonant non-literal answer in lighthouse holding story; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("scuffs of countless passages"); rhythmic diction modulates from reflective to declarative peak. Voice texture distinct, elisions purposeful for lyric build.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful motif recurrence (copperlight repose); rhythm varies, no loops obscuring closure. Minor paraphrase in reflective blocks ("simple truth... simple and impossible") deducts slightly; propulsion strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cry wolf trope transformed via lattice threading and lighthouse quarantine; non-obvious synthesis of truth-as-story feels inevitable. Risky poetic voice heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
