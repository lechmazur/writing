<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied emotions like "ears rang with pressure and eyes burned"; contradictory impulses (effortful search vs. receptive waiting) act in scene, earning the final realization with felt cost of years' patience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to meteor/lanterns triggering CR closure ("the color of sound was not something to be found but something to be received"); cost legible in "three years learning to become quiet enough"; orientation anchored early at pier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken library constrains wandering/low-tide access and charges final image ("saffron and violet threads weaving through the water"); sensory hierarchy (hush, amber ripples) filtered through lamplighter's light bias, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover color of sound) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via meteor shift narrowing from demand to reception; agency in patient endurance forecloses effort path, but cost more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of luminous vows/prayerful waiting emerges organically from particulars, final image ("lanterns above... carried that understanding into the sky") offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (light as fingerprints/synesthesia); rhythmic modulation suits lyric tone, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative density ("paper vessels climbing... stars like distant apologies") borders overwriting in opening without harm to closure; no loops, clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synesthesia premise ("color of sound") transformed through lamplighter's patient arc and sunken library; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
