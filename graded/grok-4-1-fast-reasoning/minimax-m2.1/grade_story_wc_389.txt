<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara's variant allegiance shifting between science and mystics, earning her final smile of hope with embodied cost of isolation; micro-choice to press palm on portico reveals values hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds to charged poise closure—"cobalt glass portico cracked... rise of the prophet had begun"—with legible conceptual cost repricing shadows as roots; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Portico as micro-setting constrains choices (palm press) and charges final crack/image; sensory details (static hiss, cobalt fire patterns) filtered through Elara's visionary bias, evolving with storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prophet's rise via frequencies) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via new voice and portico glow/crack narrowing isolation into charged arrival; cost felt in crystallized hope amid grime.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of variant allegiance saving broken ways emerges organically, resonant final image reweighting shadows as light sources without moralizing; complexity in Elara's betrayals lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (frequencies as wasps/veins); rhythmic modulation heightens storm intensity, diction biased toward prophetic lyricism without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but heavy figurative layering ("dying wasps... obsidian sky") borders overwrite in opening beat, slightly dulling early propulsion without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio-time bleed and lightning-forged glass transforms mystic trope; risk in gritty prophetic tone heightens stakes, inevitable prophet arrival from particulars.</comment>
