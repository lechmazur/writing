<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren's optimism roots actions like nightly processions and spring-stitching, embodied in "fingers worked" despite burden; internal gift/burden contradiction acts in dedication without alternating summaries. Mild label-speak in "haunting optimism" slightly abstracts, but micro-choices like bare feet following whispers reveal values under pressure. Final realization earned by accumulated wanderings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from wandering to cavern arrival; closure as Charged Poise in "stepped back to witness the path," reconfiguring ruin with felt cost of "life's work." Orientation anchored early in canyon/wharf weaver; lens holds cleanly through lyric progression. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Red canyon labyrinth constrains via "stone itself whispered where to step," shaping sleepwalking; cavern's "still as broken glass" charges final sacred marking. Sensory hierarchy (feet on stone, needle glint) POV-filtered by weaver's intimacy. Evolving details mirror transformation without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ruin to reverence) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to spring-stitching under lens; agency in sewing forecloses aimless wandering with visible cost in nightly burden. One deepening at cavern realization narrows to border of light. Mild abstractness in stakes, but pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of rewoven precedents emerges from sewing acts and plate image, resonating in final "luminous thread leading...toward healing"; orchid solace shifts from personal to communal without moralizing. Particulars like moonlight threads reweight premise organically. Counter-reading in sustained loss lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in poetic whispers/water echoes biases noticing; rhythm modulates from drifting to "began to sew" intensity. No head-hopping or elision debt; compression taught early as sleepwalking pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short chants propel, longer reflections breathe); density high but minor figurative pile-up in climax ("orchid solace bloom," "border of light") risks coherence without obscuring closure. Rare paraphrase near "stitching together what had been torn" but purposeful. Propulsion clear, no loops dulling image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic path-stitching in post-drought ruin, with sleep-sewing as bold risk transforming tropes; plate's crossroads inevitability in hindsight from particulars. No derivatives; vision coheres singularly.</comment>
