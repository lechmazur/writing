<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's face-blindness and pattern-seeing form a coherent, particular interiority that drives her selection and craft, revealed through concrete actions like manipulating the corroded lock. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, limiting depth; epiphany feels declarative rather than earned through struggle. Strong micro-choices under deadline pressure, but lacks visible cost to her competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from library description to coin discovery to painted ceiling, culminating in Conceptual Repricing where preservation transcends destruction ("some discoveries were about limits—the discovery that limits did not exist"). Orientation anchored early ("ancient oak... hollowed out generations ago"); cost legible in final image of her departure amid demolition sounds. No causality breaks; pattern taught early pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tree trunk library vividly constrains choices—spiral stairs, false panel near ceiling force climbing/manipulation; sensory details (bark knowledge, dry knowledge smell, tree's breathing) filter through Mira's pattern bias and charge final ceiling image. Micro-setting (coin, lantern light) enables precise indentations. No white-room; details evolve causally with her work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve guild's secret before demolition) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via coin discovery deepening task to sky-mirroring; agency in patient tracing forecloses simple preservation for transformative craft. Time pressure as live clock alters tactics (night work, dawn exit). Cost felt in building's breach, but no on-page reversal narrows options sharply enough for 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of pattern-unified wisdom and preservation-as-translation emerges organically from coin-to-ceiling craft and fractal details, reweighted in CR ending without moralizing ("patterns too intricate... underlying all apparent chaos"). Final image resonates non-literally, charging prior material. No platitudes; ambiguity in limits/perception lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pattern-focused noticing ("indentations... shift and resolve into patterns"); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive buildup to heightened stillness at close. Stable third-limited POV; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances patterns/atmosphere (e.g., "each constellation became a painted arc"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent (fractal echoes); zero figurative muddle in peak craft beat. Read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blind pattern-seer in tree-library crafting stellar sky from coin transforms preservation trope organically. Risky fractal conceit heightens stakes via irreplaceable details; inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes. Bold conceptual integrity commits to perception-limits premise.</comment>
