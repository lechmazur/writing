<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority particularized through grandmother's teachings and logbook study; contradictory impulses (ego/fear vs. pure intent) act in the vial/ vibration beat, earning the closure choice with purification cost. Micro-choices like uncorking and hands on brass reveal values under solo pressure. No safety-hedging; flaw (needing jasmine aid) complicates success.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (heat break, garden scent, jasmine) builds to vibration sent and ship turn (RR/Charged Poise), reweighting stakes with "screaming tenderness" cost legible in final logbook line. Single scene anchored early (Mira ascending at dawn); no orientation debt. Persistent lighthouse constraint shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse and night garden constrain: thermal currents warp beacon, hollow protects blooms enabling jasmine tactic, granite/salt tactile in ascent. Final "cobalt walls catching light" charges closure image. Sensory hierarchy (scent primacy post-heat) reflects Mira's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide frantic ships via intent when beacons fail) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via garden opening/jasmine to vibration agency foreclosing ego path with purification cost. Ship turn tests commitment; pressure coheres to logbook crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (pure whispers > desperate shouts) emerges from particulars like jasmine cutting ego and vibration reaching sailors; final "darkness had answered them back" non-literally reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance from flawed intent struggle, inviting ambiguity on whispers' reliability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable/single, perceptual signature in frequency/scent noticing (e.g., "sang a frequency"); rhythm modulates to compression in vibration beat. Voice texture distinct, biased toward mystical grandmother idiom; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "jasmine scent bloomed outward like a confession" advances scent, intent, emotion); varied rhythm accelerates to closure without loops or muddled figures. No scaffolds; propulsion peaks in "whispers could reach where shouts could not."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse mysticism with vibrations/intent physics, transforming trope via jasmine/oak specificity and logbook payoff. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; "night the darkness had answered back" bold, non-obvious reconfiguration.</comment>
