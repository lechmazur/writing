<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the whistling moment—"demure audacity of the act struck her even as she performed it"—earning the final pattern convergence with embodied cost in her smile and descent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from parapet observation to whistling response, landing CR closure in "pattern complete itself around her" with legible conceptual cost of reverent completion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Parapet stones and wet leaves constrain her vigil while charging the final descent; recurring moon paths and fireflies filter through her net-mender bias, mirroring internal patterns without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of appreciating hidden effort tightens via whistle agency, forcing stance crystallization as fireflies respond; felt cost in audacity reweights the pattern under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final convergence image—"moon path and the firefly dance... all converging"—resonantly answers the hidden effort question, reweighting nets/spiders/whisk without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pattern-seeing syntax ("invisible threads," "grammar of tension and release") holds stable POV distance, modulating rhythm to charged poise at whistle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels from "stone beneath her palms still held the memory" to "whisk still warm"; zero loops, coherent metaphors like "silver stitching" enhance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Net-mender philosopher's whistle integrates tropes of reflection/origami-life freshly, risking lyric convergence that heightens stakes in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
