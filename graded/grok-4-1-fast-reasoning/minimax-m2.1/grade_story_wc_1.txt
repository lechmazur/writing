<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular via glass analogies anchors adaptive transformation; grief's "loosening" embodies contradictory fear/endurance with earned shift to pursuit, satisfying 9+ test via prior causality in frost-tracing micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via frost-ledger density build to CR closure ("tucked the ledger strip against her heart... began to walk"); cost legible in fragile ledger's weight against eastern light, with no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frost veins and canyon paths constrain revelation and pursuit, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (crystalline veins mirroring ledger) reflects glass-artist POV, passing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ledger understanding) tightens via frost match narrowing victim-to-pursuer options under accumulative lens; cost felt in grief's calcified release, though internalization slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fire/light survival motif emerges organically from glass/ledger/frost particulars to resonant "light breaking through glass" without statement; reweights survival premise satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (land as molten glass) stable in close third; rhythmic modulation builds resonance without elision, passing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates action/reflection without loops or overwriting; varied rhythm propels to "smile... like light breaking through glass," satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frost-ledger-nature synthesis transforms survival trope freshly; risk in lyric accumulation heightens quiet pursuit without gimmick.</comment>
