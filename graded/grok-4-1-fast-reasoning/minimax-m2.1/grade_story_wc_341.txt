<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular through embodied cloud-emotion categorization, revealing contradictory grief/hope impulses acting simultaneously; final endurance of memorializing work earned by prior observational causality with felt anchoring cost in gripping the telescope. No unearned epiphanies; flaws in trust of gravity complicate choices organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cloud categorization to spiral pattern observation ("clouds there seemed to organize themselves into a spiral pattern"), tightening to Conceptual Repricing closure where "wholeness... beginning to spool together"; cost legible in suspended grief acceptance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sky gondola and brass telescope constrain choices (swaying creaks anchor observation, telescope gripped amid sway); final image charged by gondola holding her "between earth and stars," mirroring internal spooling. Sensory details (warm metal, groaning cable) POV-filtered through emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving absence-as-presence) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via emotional cloud catalog to spiral tightening, narrowing to memorializing endurance; agency in "stubborn act of paying attention" forecloses escape from grief with on-page emotional cost in "wholeness of her grief."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of rewoven loss emerges organically from cloud/spool/string images, reweighted in final "strings could be rewoven from memory"; resonant non-literal answer to absence via charged poise, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature in emotional cloud-seeing; rhythmic prose modulates from luminous observation to deepening evening, prose-as-character reflecting scientist's poetic mind under grief pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (clouds as grief/hope, spools) coherent and accumulative, no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion in sentence escalation to closure image without overwriting in peak realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aviation meteorology with emotional weather catalog into spooled wholeness premise; risk-taking in lyric accumulative mode heightens stakes via cloud-spiral turn, inevitable in hindsight from grief observations.</comment>
