<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the ritual—Mira presses portrait to chest before burning, embodying desire for wholeness against acceptance of incompleteness—with final endurance of elusive truth earned via prior micro-choices and felt in tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through ritual beats to CR closure in final image of carrying fragments, reweighting incomplete info with undeniable emotional cost legible in "weight of everything she would never fully understand."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurring rocking chair and porcelain shards constrain ritual choices and charge final image, with gallery's vanishing light mirroring internal transformation; selective sensory details (fading light, ash texture) integrate purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honoring elusive grandmother tightens accumulatively via deepening ritual (burning portrait narrows grasp), forcing renunciation with on-page cost in tears and unasked questions; subtle but coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through incompleteness emerges from ash-filling action and mask image, offering resonant non-literal answer in final realization without moralizing; prior particulars reweighted organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (artistic lens on "powdering that Mira collected"), rhythmic control heightens ritual pressure; purposeful compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels ritual beats; minor figurative density in reflective stretches coherent and voice-motivated, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image of glowing mask.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ritual synthesis of burning/scattering into mask transforms grief trope via specific ash-porcelain vessel; bold lyric risk in accumulative destruction honors elusive truth with inevitable hindsight payoff.</comment>
