<comment>Mage's interiority concretely embodies lukewarm magic as both flaw and strength, with micro-choices like measured dripping revealing hierarchy of patience over power; final endurance as bell-ringer forecloses prior inadequacy with ongoing cost. Earnestly naive belief drives pivotal repair without unearned epiphany. Contradictory impulses (doubt vs. purpose) act simultaneously in initial study and persistent application.</comment>

<grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: droplet observation patterns → measured application → narrowing crack tightens to full repair (RR closure). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in "arms ached... magic felt thin" shaping final ringing image. Single scene causality intact, no ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>Sapphire viaduct's dew channels and blue glow constrain dripping method and charge repaired bell's inner light; sensory selection (dripping rates, dew accumulation) mirrors POV urgency. Final image evolves setting tactilely via absorbed light. Micro-setting (railing channels, stone basins) guides choices purposefully.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (repair bell to right imbalance) signaled early; accumulative escalation via persistent dripping densities reweights as crack vanishes, forcing endurance trade-off with physical strain cost on-page. Agency in patient application narrows options from failure to success. Village response crystallizes pressure payoff.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of modest persistence over spectacle emerges via dripping motif shifting from observation to transformation; final bell voice with "faint drip... underneath" resonates non-literally without moralizing. Particulars (lukewarm magic, water-worn stone) reweight premise organically. No tidy resolution, ambiguity in "changed" bell lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in patient droplet watching and warmth metaphors; rhythmic modulation builds from study to ringing climax. Prose texture distinct via syntax echoing persistence (long accumulating sentences). No head-hopping, inference matches mage's knowledge.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>High density with lines doubling action/atmosphere (e.g., "gathered the dripping water... infusing each drop"); varied rhythm propels from dawn to dusk without loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent (water wearing stone patterns repair). Zero artifacts dull closure image of glowing bell.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis transforms mage inadequacy trope via dripping rates as "adequate" method; risk in forgoing spectacle for accumulative patience heightens stakes organically. Premise (cosmic mend via mundane persistence) inevitable in hindsight from viaduct dew cue. No derivative echoes, bold voice commits fully.</comment>
