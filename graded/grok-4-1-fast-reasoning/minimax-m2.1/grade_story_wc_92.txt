<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's calmly inventive trait roots clear motivation, shown in methodical tracing of sundial angles amid blackout chaos, compelling her discovery; micro-choices like rotating the quill reveal hierarchy of values. No simultaneous contradictory impulses act in scene—steady competence lacks embodied struggle—preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds to quill-click discovery and parchment reveal, yielding Charged Poise CR at "By dawn, she would have transmitted," with conceptual cost of revolutionary commitment legible in final calculation image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sundial's half-painted angles and geometric codes constrain Elara's choices, guiding quill alignment and charging closure image of enduring ideas in stone; selective twilight shadows and flickering lights mirror internal shift purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of curiosity tightens accumulatively via sundial pattern emergence and quill resonance, narrowing to revolutionary coordination; agency in kneeling/tracing forecloses passive vigilance, with regime risk as felt conceptual cost charging poised ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden geometry enduring against regime erasure emerges organically from sundial codes to cradle schematics; final "kindle something far more enduring" reweights premise non-literally with resonant idea-over-illumination contrast.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with inventive perceptual signature (e.g., "catalogued these anomalies"); rhythmic syntax modulates from patient scanning to quickened pulse, heightening pressure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like quill's "faint resonance seemed to intensify"; minor repetitive "calmly inventive" stems create template cadence echo but don't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious quill-sundial mechanism transforms sundial trope into revolutionary cipher network, synthesizing geometry/rebellion organically; risk of coded subtlety heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via early anomalies.</comment>
