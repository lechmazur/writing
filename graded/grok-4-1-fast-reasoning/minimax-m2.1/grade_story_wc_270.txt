<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Yara's shift from "safety of silence" to urging "Help me read the script" earns the closure choice through contradictory impulses of fear (mother's burning) and ancestral pull, with embodied cost in "dangerous territory of transformation."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as embryo, plants' chorus, and kite script build density to Charged Poise closure at "She would unseal the chamber," reconfiguring destiny with legible conceptual cost of defying elders; orientation anchored early in greenhouse reconstruction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse plants constrain choices via "chorus of recognition" and calming, charging final embryo pulse; volcanic steam and ash clouds filter through Yara's perceptual bias, evolving with revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elders' reburial demand vs. plants' urgency tightens dominant stake accumulatively, forcing Yara's agency in script-decoding with on-page cost of witchcraft-risk echo in mother's memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of evolving tradition emerges implicitly from embryo-as-seed and kite-map particulars, resonating in final pulse as non-literal answer reweighting implanted destiny without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Yara's plant-language signature ("colors and temperature shifts") biases perception; minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven in Anya's explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via plant "screaming" crescendo to calming cadence, with high density; minor "intention" repetition slightly dulls peak revelation without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plant telepathy and amber embryo synthesize ancestral sci-fi ingenuity, transforming witchcraft trope through reconstruction stakes; kite-map turn feels inevitable from greenhouse logic.</comment>
