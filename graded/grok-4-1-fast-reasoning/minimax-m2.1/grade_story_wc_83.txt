<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in mundane urination humiliating survival and overthinking wife's death; final endurance hunt earned via reflective micro-choices tying geode to perturbation theory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from wedding shard to geode warmth CR, reweighting survival as node with conceptual cost of endless indifference; orientation anchored by geode opener.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Geode crystals constrain reflection and charge final scattering geometries image; observatory cables/ruins selectively mirror catastrophe priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to hunt pooled potential signaled early, deepens accumulatively via theory linking strike/geode; endurance forecloses conventional paths with isolation cost legible in final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final geode awakening image offers non-literal resonant answer to indifference premise, reweighting via bleak exhilaration without moralizing; emerges from strike/potential particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mathematical/geological diction like "geometries that feel almost like answers"; rhythmic control heightens reflective pressure seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied rhythm, purposeful geode/potential recurrence; minor "potential pools" synonym churn serves texture but caps perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone math/geode god transforms catastrophe trope; reflective risk-taking inevitable in hindsight, heightening conceptual stakes.</comment>
