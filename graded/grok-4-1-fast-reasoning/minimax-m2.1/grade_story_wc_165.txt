<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong analytical traits shown through precise object handling and philosophy, with micro-choices like scattering billiard balls revealing values. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; interiority is concrete but more declarative than conflicted under pressure. Final endurance of calculation feels earned but without visible cost on pivotal performance beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from prep to performance; orientation anchored early in arcade/tide. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in final line's "analyst's smile, already calculating tomorrow," reweighting premise with ongoing cost of endless orchestration against monotony. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration like "salt-thick air" and tide's rhythm mirrors internal stakes, constraining timing of acts. Bishop and billiard balls as micro-setting charge choices and final pocketed return. Environment evolves with crowd draw, guiding serendipity without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of orchestrating serendipity escalates accumulatively via prep to audience improvisation, narrowing to "luminous moments" with felt cost of perpetual fight. Bishop toss to couple's smile tightens pressure coherently under lens. Minor abstractness in stakes keeps from 9+; cost legible in tide's repetition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of probability-made-palatable emerges organically from actions, culminating in non-literal resonance of "calculation dressed as intuition" recharging motifs. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in creativity's cost against natural rhythms. Final image answers central question without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in geometric precision ("geometry of it was precise") and rhythmic syntax matching analytical mind. Voice modulates fluidly from prep to performance without filter excess. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image integration like "white gleam against black sky"; minor paraphrase loops in "between acts" phrasing (−0.3). No artifacts dull closure; propulsion clear in sentence variety.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of street performance as mathematical art in tidal margins transforms trope via specific philosophy. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Analyst's smile feels inevitable hindsight reconfiguration.</comment>
