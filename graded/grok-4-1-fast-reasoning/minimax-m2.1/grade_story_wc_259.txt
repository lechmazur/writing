<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation evolves convincingly from scholarship to desperate transformation, embodied in the dance's surrender; contradictory impulses (possess vs. release) act simultaneously. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "these atoms of nostalgia were not contaminants" slightly abstracts peak interiority without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of motes and spirals builds to Conceptual Repricing closure ("boundary between historian and history dissolved") with transformation cost legible in final embrace. Orientation anchored early (pagoda, archive, twilight); single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (prismatic rainbows on dust, luminescent motes brushing veil) constrain dance and charge final image (pagoda's intensifying light). POV-filtered (historian's eye on shifting symbols); no white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purify atoms) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening (motes rising, boundary dissolving) under Accumulative lens, forcing agency in unpredictable dance. Cost felt in own memories rising and emergence "changed, bearing burden."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (release over possession, becoming knowledge) emerges organically from dance and motes; final image reconfigures premise without moralizing ("carry these atoms... into whatever future"). Resonant, non-literal answer with anguished joy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice with perceptual signature (noticing shifting symbols, motes as memory fragments); rhythmic control modulates from description to intensity in dance. Stable first-person POV; purposeful compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; purposeful repetition (spirals, unpredictable) taught as pattern. Minor paraphrase loops ("unpredictable" motif overused without escalation) dull two mid-beats slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nostalgia as physical atoms, pagoda purification, unpredictable dance transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable at closure.</comment>
