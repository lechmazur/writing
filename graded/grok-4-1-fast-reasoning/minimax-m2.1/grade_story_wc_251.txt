<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in patience shines through chess teaching and town displays, earning subtle change without on-page contradiction. Interiority concrete via "cradle fragmented feelings like wounded birds," but lacks simultaneous impulses acting in high-pressure micro-choices, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of quiet acts builds to CR closure in "forest of new possibilities," reweighting revolution premise with patience's cost—final image undeniable. Mosaic shards pattern-taught early via Eleanor’s methods; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt library and grotto constrain her power and charge final image, with mist-emergence mirroring theme. Sensory selection (hush, hum) purposeful, POV-biased toward unspoken; micro-settings like windows evolve with effects.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of planting second thoughts signaled early, escalates via density (kids → displays → town fractures) under accumulative lens, narrowing to humble cost over grand change. One tightening in specific town examples forces stance crystallization; agency clear in organizing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of quiet pause's power emerges organically from displays and chess, final "patient pause" image resonant non-literal answer reweighting certainty. Subtext in windows' "half-finished conversations" invites ambiguity without morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature of amplified silences; rhythmic prose ("pawn advancing two squares when no one expected") modulates purposefully. No dialogue; elisions taught via pattern, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors (forests/seeds from windows) propel without loops; minor "quiet" recurrence pattern-taught. No artifacts dull closure; read-aloud cadence breathes with lyric accumulation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess/library/windows transforms revolution trope into patient accumulation, risk-taking in mosaic lyricism heightens stakes. Final grotto reprise inevitable from early particulars.</comment>
