<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority concrete through gear's warmth and hum rising in chest, showing embodied realization; micro-choice of placing gear reveals values under pressure. Final step-through earned by accumulated insight, but lacks sharper blind spots or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously to push higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sounds, gears, vines builds to CR closure at "the straying had ended... no back to return to," with legible conceptual cost of permanent reconfiguration. Orientation anchored early in clearing and jungle; single-shard wandering tightens meaningfully without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest specifics (silicon bark, tin leaves singing minor key) filter through philosopher's perceptual bias, constrain at tangle wall, and charge final humming farewell image. Sensory hierarchy reflects awakening urgency; micro-setting (gear) evolves tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-navigation signaled early via gear/translocation; accumulative deepening via minor-key warning to tangle tightens pressure, narrowing to renunciation of return with felt cost at doorway. Agency in placing gear forces trade-off; one intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of externalized mind emerges organically from gear threads and jungle manifestation, answered non-literally by light doorway reweighting "probable miracles." Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; final image invites lingering ambiguity on stability's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature in "hum of insight" and tree melodies; rhythmic syntax modulates insight's rise without slippage. Prose texture as philosopher's mind: selective, biased noticing of brass ferns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "hum"/"unraveling" recurrence building cadence; varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or scaffold. Minor figurative density in peak (vines as waking tendrils) integrates without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical rainforest as consciousness frontier transforms philosophy trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off at doorway reconfiguration. Irreplaceable particulars like warm gear make inevitability felt.</comment>
