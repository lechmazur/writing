<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with concrete, embodied conflict—Mira's anger at systems versus seeking wisdom peaks in the ink ritual drawing her mother's face, earning the final renunciation of rage with felt cost of three years' isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly in single scene; orientation anchored by ~50 words (observatory, post-error); closure as CR lands cleanly in "Mira felt whole," reweighting premise with undeniable emotional cost of foreclosed anger, no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Opal observatory and ink table constrain ritual choices vividly (shimmering walls, cooling ink patterns steady into Comforter); sensory hierarchy (touch of ink, candle reflection) charges final humming image without overwriting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wisdom from failure) signaled early, deepens via defragmentation ritual under accumulative lens, narrowing to stance crystallization; cost legible in mental fog clearing, though minor abstractness in ghost transmission slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of human error in systems emerges implicitly through ink patterns and ghost's apology; final image of heartbeat trusting itself offers resonant CR repricing anger into wholeness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (heartbeat counting, ink memory); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in closing lines, purposeful elision of ghost details paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; ink patterns "shifting as wax cooled" exemplify multi-job lines; minor figurative density in opening (milky iridescence, bone from earth) risks slight overload but serves accumulative texture without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-collapse ghost in ink rituals transforms bureaucratic horror trope; risk in abstract digital defragmentation pays off via irreplaceable opal/ink logic charging solace closure.</comment>
