<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via clinical notes on scream and palette focus; motivation intensifies through layered questions compelling entry to vestry; final understanding of color earns change with embodied focus as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build (chant layers, darkness gathers); Charged Poise closure on "lifted the palette... entered the threshold" with conceptual cost of singular focus legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dimensional anchor and palette constrain choices and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (chant sound, air weight, crimson glow) filtered through threshold obsession; spatial coherence via vestry pull.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of illuminating assumptions tightens accumulatively via scream frustration, unraveling stillness, chant wall; agency in pedal adjustments and questions forecloses retreat with palette's wound-like insistence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of presence via thresholds emerges organically from color realization and looped chant; final image reweights assumptions non-literally as "wound that refused to heal," charging prior motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in rhetorical framing ("questions that refused resolution"); diction/rhythm modulates to wall-of-sound intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figuratives (unraveling threads, plumb line) advancing texture; varied rhythm peaks propulsively at "loop pedal clicked once more"; zero loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exorcism as rhetorical threshold-probing with loop pedal and single-color palette; risk in conceptual possession-as-cooperation heightens stakes to charged entry.</comment>
