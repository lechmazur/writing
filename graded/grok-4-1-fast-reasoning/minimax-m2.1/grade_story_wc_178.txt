<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maruk's frugality and thoroughness drive contradictory impulses—dismissal of superstition vs. empirical verification—culminating in the earned ritual choice with visible cost in "sleepless nights" and generational oversight. Interiority particular (counting stars/supplies), embodied irony "settled into Maruk's bones." Final endurance at post forecloses abandonment path holistically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from supplies to schematics discovery to ritual cadence shift. Closure as Charged Poise RR lands on-page in "presence that answered... covenant renew itself," with conceptual cost in "not because he was special but... thorough enough." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening via realization suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rooftop observatory and palace archives constrain choices (star mapping, candle arrangement mirroring square). Final image charges with "still at his post... stars seemed closer." Sensory selective (subsonic resonance, candlelight thrift); POV bias filters via scholarly priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renew covenant pre-regime) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening realizations narrowing to ritual agency. One tightening: oversight irony forces stance crystallization. Cost legible in renewal's "thorough enough" repricing; pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mathematical harmony/order amid chaos emerges organically from tile, stars, covenant; irony reweights oversight without moralizing. Final image resonates non-literally: "some devotions are best encrypted" answers devotion question via Encrypted Stasis. Particulars (magic square poem) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable 3rd-limited POV with perceptual signature (celestial frugality, empirical whispers). Prose texture distinct: rhythmic neologism "duskyaccord" fits dusky harmony; diction modulates intensity without register drift. No dialogue; elision of guardian details paid off in gentle uncloaking.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "frugal nature... grim satisfaction in how little oil" advances char/prose). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; minor figurative density in peak ("twilight atmosphere... hold its breath") coherent. Propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: magic square as encrypted star-covenant to "pattern-consciousness" transforms trope organically. Risky neologism/lyric tone heightens stakes; non-obvious irony (oversight enables renewal) inevitable in hindsight, no derivatives.</comment>
