<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied intuition of distances, with micro-choices like tracing grain revealing contradictory curiosity/violation impulses; final crossing earned by prior gift/curse tension. Minor abstraction in "sacred threshold" diagnostic speak slightly tempers peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density (grain, light, codes) reconfigures drift as deliberate path to CR closure; cost legible in "stepped off the drifting platform and onto solid ground," foreclosing random loss with conceptual price of choice. Orientation anchored early; no shards, clean single scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism terrace and wood grain constrain realization/choice, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (light fracture, grain stress) reflects Elara's priorities, evolves causally with drift. "Crooked rivers toward the coast" mirrors internal patterns purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnect via thresholds) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through code/grain decoding narrowing options to cross; agency in stepping off with felt violation cost. Minor abstract stakes declaration slightly mutes visceral peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries-as-doorways emerges organically from particulars (distances, mazes, effect), final image ("every boundary was also a doorway") resonant non-literal CR reweighting premise without moralizing. Counter-readings in sacred/violation ambiguity linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (light spectra, grain logic) biases noticing consistently; rhythmic compression modulates with realizations, stable close third-person. Purposeful lyric elision taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm; no loops, clean connectors. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("spiraling paths... crooked rivers") risks coherence in opening but pattern-taught and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of butterfly effect, corn mazes, wood-reading as coordinates transforms tropes; risk-taking in drifting architecture heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via "weather codes weren't predictions—they were coordinates."</comment>
