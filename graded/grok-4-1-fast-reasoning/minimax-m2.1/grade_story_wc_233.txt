<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Queen's weariness and wonder contradict in embodied climb ("crown weighted with memories") and micro-choices like pausing to whisper, earning rebirth realization with emotional cost of prior three-year smile absence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density build from climb to grotto realization (RR/CR); closure cost legible in "woman reborn with mystery solved," reweighting disenchantment without causal breaks; orientation anchored early in ridge path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Recurring light motifs (fireflies, starlight pools) constrain entry and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (frost air, copper tears) filters through weary POV, evolving causally to pulse gently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel dreams) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via steep climb and kneeling realization narrowing weariness; cost felt in foreclosed disenchantment, though internal pressure lacks sharper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed wonder from wounded nature emerges via particulars (bleeding starlight as summons); final fireflies weave resonant non-literal answer to disenchantment without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (lacy/light diction) modulates with intensity; rhythmic control peaks in breath-firefly moment, no elisions or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("weeping wound," "liquid silver") taught early via dreams; minor figurative density in peak grotto entry (-0.2) but no loops, scaffolds, or muddle at closure smile.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh wounded-sky grotto transforms queen trope via firefly-breath synthesis; risk in lyric menace-to-wonder shift heightens stakes organically.</comment>
