<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's internal conflict between self-persuasion ("gently persuasive with himself,编织ing arguments from hope") and learned limits culminates in earned renunciation, pocketing the fragment with embodied cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene via vine parallels to love's failure. Flaw of clinging transforms without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from bus departure to vine walk to pavilion return, culminating in CR closure ("pocketed the burned fragment one final time") with legible cost of surrendered grief. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vineyard and pavilion constrain choices (vines "claimed him"; pavilion vantage for departures/acceptance) and charge final image of stars and humming vines. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (harvest whispers, falling fruit). No white-room; lived-in tactile navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of acceptance deepens accumulatively via letter trace and vine realization, narrowing to endurance with felt cost ("grief transforming into something gentler"). One tightening sufficient; agency in final pocket forecloses clinging. Price legible in smile amid hurt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love as teacher via mismatches emerges organically from vine/letter parallels, reweighted in CR final image without moralizing ("love's purpose was not always permanence"). Resonant non-literal answer lingers in acceptance's arrival.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with vintner perceptual signature (grapes' "skins tight with potential"; seasons' "ancient patience"). Rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punches amid lyric flow); metaphors coherent and purposeful (vines as trellis for love). No loops, scaffolds, or muddle; propulsion peaks in closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vineyard rhythms with mismatched love transforms trope; quiet CR ending risks subtlety for resonance. Specifics like burned edge and bus station avoid generics.</comment>
