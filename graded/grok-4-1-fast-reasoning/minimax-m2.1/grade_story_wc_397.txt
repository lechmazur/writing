<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Actuary background and parasol handling ground motivation concretely, with irony at closure earning endurance of loosened grip as preparation; embodied emotions via warm finial and ice sounds avoid clichés. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("grips reality loosely") feels slightly abstracted from crisis immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from debris trawling to ice's patient grinding, yielding Charged Poise CR at marina edge where "looseness felt less like loss" reconfigures endings as breath with grandmother's ironic cost legible in final reflection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina's grinding clusters and groaning constrain perception, mirroring internal loosening and charging closure image; parasol finial as micro-object tethers tactilely across beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of learning endings' sound tightens accumulatively via volunteering's raw evidence, forcing stance crystallization at final marina walk with foreclosed endurance path via ironic departure choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Endings as process emerges organically from ice/debris particulars, resonating in closure's breath image that reweights premise without moralizing; parasol irony adds complex ambiguity on courage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, with perceptual signature in sound-focused noticing (ice bells, gentle endings); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density weaves sensory propulsion; "learned" template run ("learned to trawl... learned the particular weight... learned that endings") dulls one beat, docking propulsion without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourist/actuary in disaster relief transforms trope via ice's textural wisdom and parasol irony; risk of quiet lyric closure heightens inevitability.</comment>
