<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority through concrete perceptual bias (stars as people/conspiracies) and motivation rooted in suppressed voices, culminating in earned micro-choice to stitch futures; embodied emotions subtle but consistent via palm on chart and smile. Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits to very strong. Flaws like high competence balance with disguised wisdom's trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chart-threading to flame-sync revelations, tightening via shadows revealing violence, to Charged Poise closure in needle-lift/stitching forward paths with felt cost of impending coup in final image ("embroidery...outlast them all"). Orientation anchored early; one continuous scene fits scope; persistent constraint (needle/flame) shapes final tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eternal candle as micro-setting constrains perception and charges closure (flame flickers shadows, burns on patiently); cobalt observatory/autumn details (frost, wind rattling windows) selectively mirror internal states and pressure choices via isolation/disguise. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (light through patterns); vivid, integrated without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose coup via silences/charts) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through flame-sync deepening knowledge of unraveling threads, narrowing to agency in final stitching that forecloses inaction with legible cost (conspirators unaware, violence shape seen). One tightening sufficient; moral calculus in wisdom's disguise sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truths in silences emerges organically from particulars (spaces between stars, unheard stories), reweighted non-literally in final stitching/action image answering "how to counter conspiracy" via seeds of exposure. Subtext in gesture (small smile); ambiguity lingers without confusion; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (celestial encoding, threads of possibility); rhythmic control modulates reflective to charged poise at end; diction purposeful (e.g., "whispered secrets finally given breath"). No head-hopping or elision issues; voice coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm/syntax; purposeful figurative language (e.g., constellations blooming) taught early without muddle in peak (final stitching). Minor paraphrase loops (repetitive "threads"/"spaces between" phrasing) and elevated diction slightly drag momentum but don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Core premise (embroidery as espionage encoding) fresh synthesis of galaxy charts/conspiracies, transformed via specific galaxy-chart logic and disguised wisdom; final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars. Risk-taking in accumulative lyric structure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
