<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority through embodied precision ("trembling fingers collected samples") and inherited traits compelling the closure choice to continue; contradictory grief and resolve layer realistically without therapy-speak. Minor diagnostic phrasing in reflections ("love could be encoded") borders unearned but anchors to concrete cues.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from adhesive analysis to volcano shudders, landing CR closure in "dappled resolve filled her... harmony found its enduring form" where conceptual cost of grief-to-inheritance reconfigures premise; orientation anchored immediately, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amphitheater's breathing stones and geothermal channels constrain choices (shudders heighten urgency) and charge final image of "stones settling into their eternal negotiation"; sensory hierarchy via engineer's eye (decay patterns, thermal currents) filters purposefully, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding father's message tightens via analysis patterns and shudders ("volcanic stones shuddered more noticeably"), narrowing to endurance choice with felt emotional cost; agency in sampling/spectroscope drives under Accumulative lens, but abstract stakes occasionally dilute visceral pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of harmonizing conflicting values emerges organically from engineering motifs and adhesive realization, resonating in non-literal final image of "inheritance—measured out link by measured link"; earned through particulars, avoids moralizing though reflections verge platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (chemical signatures, convection rhythms) and rhythmic modulation under rising pressure; syntax reflects engineer's mind (calculating patterns), purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and propulsion, but figurative density peaks in closure ("exhaled its accumulated heat") borders overwriting without obscuring; minor synonym loops in "harmonize" phrasing deduct lightly, no scaffold or artifacts dulling final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of adhesive chemistry as encrypted love and volcano amphitheater as engineered harmony transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric engineering metaphors heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via chain's reprise.</comment>
