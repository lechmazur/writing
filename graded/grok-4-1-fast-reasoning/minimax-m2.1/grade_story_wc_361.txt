<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when grief "seizes" Elara's throat but dissolves into warmth via pendant's hum, earning her final reconfiguration from jittery dispersal to steady courier of possibilities.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pendant's vibration accumulates to Mira's aurora-born appearance and CR closure, where Elara reprices absence as "potential" with emotional cost legible in fading form and lingering hum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora's "green shimmer" and "sway" constrain the sympathetic trigger on the "frost-dusted" ridgeway overlook, charging the final descent image with ghostly persistence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake of Mira's absence tightens accumulatively from routine climb to vibrating summons and realization, narrowing Elara's options from grief-bound incompleteness to forward-extending agency with cost in accepting "what I couldn't stay to watch."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurring vibration motif shifts from preservation to extension, offering resonant non-literal answer in final "wonder kept growing" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's jitter-specific noticing ("tremor in her hands," "fogged and scattered breath") signatures POV; Mira's "wind through pine branches" voice subtextually pursues teaching goal, distinct from Elara's interior.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; dense propulsion peaks in "wings blurring with speed, and the questions dissolved," varying rhythm without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sympathetic vibration extending encounters transforms absent-mentor trope into mythic realism, with aurora constraint risking bold fade that heightens closure ingenuity.</comment>
