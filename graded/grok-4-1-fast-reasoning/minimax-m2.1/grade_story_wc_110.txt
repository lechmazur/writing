<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to thaw mistrust via symbols is clear and intensifies through Mira's touch, compelling the final shift to drawing; interiority particularized via lens habit and contradictory hope/caution. Mira applies relational pressure, forcing micro-choice reciprocity. Minor slip: hope shift in her expression feels slightly stock, but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from doodle exchange to touch to final visitor, culminating in Charged Poise RR closure—"I reached for my pen... to draw"—reconfiguring isolation to possibility with persistence cost legible in "lens... heavier." Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early (forecourt, registrar role). No causal breaks; pattern pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains via refracting light/hum signaling others, charging final image; water droplets "like held tears" mirror thawing mistrust. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (crystals catch diffused light into "hopeful refractions"). Micro-setting (counter, ledger) guides ticket exchange; evolves causally with mist/sounds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transparency vs. mistrust) signaled early, tightens texturally via Mira's hand squeeze narrowing to earned action; agency in ticket selection forecloses waiting with persistence cost. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, one deepening sufficient. Minor abstractness in "painful work of being seen" doesn't dull peak touch beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of symbol-freed honesty emerges organically from doodles/mirrors to final "honesty... might finally be enough," resonant non-literal answer reweighting word-failure premise without moralizing. Subtext in infinite mirrors charges closure image. No forced motifs; complexity lingers in inscrutability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV stable, perceptual signature "ambiguously clear" biases noticing (smudged lens, cryptic circles). Prose texture rhythmic, modulates from reflective to charged ("resonant hush... like a promise"). No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "water droplets... like held tears" advances atmosphere/motif); rhythm varies, propulsion fits quiet escalation. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("infinitely receding image... thawing the frost") during exchange slightly muddles but pattern-taught; no loops touch closure "I began."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-verbal world of doodle-tickets transforms mistrust trope into hopeful stasis; infinite-mirror ticket turn inevitable from lens setup. Bold voice commits to premise without retreat; risk in symbol-reliance heightens stakes organically.</comment>
