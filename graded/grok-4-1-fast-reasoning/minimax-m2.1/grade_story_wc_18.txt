<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Solid interiority and motivation rooted in Mira's expertise with mirrors as membranes, embodied in synchronized breathing; micro-choices like shaping glass reveal values. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal creation beat, keeping it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in final image of glass mountains, reweighting dream capture with conceptual cost of patience/precision legible in "the work of recreation required patience and precision." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via sextant incorporation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog and orchard as micro-setting constrain work (mirrors thrive in "permanent embrace" of mist) and charge final image where "fog pressing close" softens boundaries. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific; details evolve causally with light shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recreate dream) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through night's deepening sync narrowing to completion; agency in process forecloses failure path with felt cost of endurance. Pivotal reveal tests stake without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of thresholds emerges organically from particulars like fog/breath/glass; final image non-literally answers boundary-erasing with resonant CR of mountains "both dawn and dusk," reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (noticing "subtle expansion and contraction of the glass"); rhythmic control modulates to charged poise at end, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm supporting accumulative build; metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (breath/glass/mist as membranes). Minor density in boundary motifs doesn't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirrors as crossing membranes incorporating sextant transforms tropes; risk in lyric process heightens stakes to inevitable CR, specific to voice/setting without derivatives.</comment>
