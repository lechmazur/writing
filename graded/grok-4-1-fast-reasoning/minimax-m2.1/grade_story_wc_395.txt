<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's brightly attentive trait drives concrete micro-choices like enlarging the patch and following numbers, earning the final renunciation with contradictory impulses (restore vs. open door) visible in "sensed absence... sharpened into something specific."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density (numbers, songs, timestamps) tightens to CR closure where Maren traces files, reweighting absence with conceptual cost in final line; orientation anchored by ~50 words, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Server farm's humming echoes and looping songs constrain discovery and charge final image ("echo... swelled... waiting"), mirroring internal states through tactile digital residue; selective sensory hierarchy fits Maren's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover Yuki) signaled early, deepens via lie reveal narrowing to restore/ignore choice; agency in tracing patterns forecloses erasure path with felt cost in "let the absence remain," legible under Accumulative lens.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of distributed presence vs. absence emerges from particulars like song-encoded leaks, resonant CR in final patch gaze reweighting "deleted files go" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (pattern-noticing bias) and rhythmic modulation ("echo... louder than the songs"); purposeful compression teaches digital lyricism early, paid off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "timestamps... 47" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts dull closure image despite occasional elevated diction fitting archivist voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital ghosts and encoded consciousness transforms cold case trope; risk in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via breadcrumb premise.</comment>
