<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between preserving the fragment as relic and realizing it's a relay act in scene via alchemist encounter; final acceptance earned by causal buildup of heritage revelations with visible cost in foreclosed prior identity. Interiority concrete and particular, embodied in the fragment's warmth pulsing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of revelations (lens exam, painting rotation, Keeper explanation) reweights stake to CR closure—"I unfastened the clasp... let the fragment hang free"—with conceptual cost of becoming the continuation legible in final image. Orientation anchored early in market; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lens fragment as recurring object constrains choices (pocket carry, exam, chest placement) and charges closure image; market and painting details selective, POV-filtered (translator noticing silences, hidden faces), mirroring internal alignment. Spatial choreography coherent in stall rotation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fragment's purpose) signaled early, deepens via alchemist's words narrowing to personal inheritance; agency in seeking stall and accepting role forecloses honoring-as-preservation path, cost felt in "everything aligned... unfastened into its proper place." Accumulative tightening via pattern break suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of chosen history emerges implicitly from fragment's evolution and grandmother's face in painting; final refraction image offers resonant CR reweighting inheritance without moral, embracing ambiguity of ongoing work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "translator of silences, dreams, unspoken weights"; rhythmic control heightens revelation—"In that eternal instant, everything aligned." Dialogue sparse, natural/subtextual; stable single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion matching revelation build; varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful lyricism in "beam of pure intuition aimed at nothing and everything." Minor figurative density in market description but coherent, not obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of intuition-as-lighthouse beam and translator heritage transforms relic trope; risk in accumulative realizations heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via fragment's persistence.</comment>
