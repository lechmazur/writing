<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's traits—intimate labyrinth knowledge, talismanic objects—drive higher-stakes choices like whisper coordination, with embodied emotion in the warming coin. Contradictory competence (no flaws shown) balanced by endurance under storm pressure. Final silent confrontation with Reyes earns her poised renunciation of verbal triumph, foreclosing rivalry with relational cost. Hierarchy of values revealed in micro-choices like pocketing the key.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from storm disruption and challenge to whisper network success, culminating in CR closure ("something had shifted in the hierarchy of knowledge") with conceptual cost legible in Reyes' admission and final descent. Orientation anchored early (port labyrinth, storm). Single scene holds, one tightening via guided evacuations. Pattern pays off without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Labyrinth setting constrains navigation and tactics (e.g., "corridors echoed footsteps"); storm sensory details (violet lights, groaning steel) narrow perception purposefully. POV-filtered (professional ear for drags, echoes) integrates into action. Final shuddering walls charge closure image, mirroring internal reconfiguration. Micro-objects like maps enable choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whispers vs. official channels) signaled in challenge dialogue, escalates accumulatively to 200 evacuations and Reyes' admission, narrowing options with agency in network-building. One tightening forecloses official superiority; cost felt in Reyes' "weight of a man who had been wrong." Coheres under lens to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of human networks over tech emerges organically from particulars (whispers as mycelium, footstep IDs); final key-pocketing reweights premise without statement. Subtext in silences and admissions invites ambiguity on hierarchy shifts. Resonance from coin's warmth tying to father's approval, non-literal answer to challenge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (sound hierarchies, map creases as memory). Prose rhythm modulates intensity (short steps in maze, expansive reflections anchored). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Whispers travel farther"), advances plot. No head-hopping; diction POV-plausible (port-worker idiom).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density (e.g., maps "folded... to cloth" does character/setting/action); varied rhythm accelerates in movement beats. No loops/artifacts; purposeful metaphors (mycelium) cohere without muddle. Propulsion peaks in catwalk confrontation, clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: geomagnetic storm exposes port labyrinth as human-knowledge crucible, transforming maze trope via footstep/whisper network. Risk in accumulative proof sans confrontation heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable particulars like zodiac coin reprise avoid templates.</comment>
