<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Solitary POV delivers concrete interiority and embodied emotion (chip's warmth as "second heartbeat"), with contradictory impulses in wondering if "midnight had understood something"; final endurance of partial reclamation earned by covenant-rooted motivation, no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflections and adjustments builds to RR closure in "the first note rose... true," with legible cost ("light... not fully reclaimed—perhaps it never could be") in final lines; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Resonance chamber's rules (wilts falsehood, demands spoken work) constrain choices like narrating adjustments; recurring chip glow and orchestrion pipes charge final vibration image, sensory hierarchy (hum, whisper, tremor) POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim stolen light/song via covenant) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through tethering under textural lens to one deepening (pipes breathe note); agency in patient wiring forecloses full restoration with felt partial cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of honest patience mending fragile truths emerges organically from particulars like frightened songs and rust covenant; final image ("song had remembered how to be born") offers resonant CR repricing silence vs. rebirth without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (music-as-life metaphors like "springs still eager to dance"); rhythmic modulation builds to closure frisson, no head-hopping or leakage, diction controlled and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied syntax, no loops), purposeful figuratives like "silence that gathered like rust" cohere without muddle; minor density in reflective beats but weaves into action, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical stone, fading songs, rust covenant transforms tropes via specific rules (dishonesty wilts); risk in lyric patience arc feels inevitable, final pitch image bold and grounded.</comment>
