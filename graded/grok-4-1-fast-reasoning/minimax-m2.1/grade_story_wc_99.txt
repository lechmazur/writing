<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied patience (wind drying hands, eyes closed to wind); traits shown concretely through bonsai precision and subtle pattern-noticing. Minor slip: realization feels more receptive than actively chosen, but endurance of regret-to-forgiveness arc earns closure with felt cost. Contradictory impulses (regret vs. diffusion) act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of lace/compass study builds to CR closure ("compass needle steadied... pointing... to the center of his own chest"). Orientation anchored early (Marek on stones, post-rain islet). Cost legible in loosened chest and foreclosed regret path; constraint (light-shifting lace) shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurrent objects (lace, compass, bonsai pine) constrain choices (patient viewing, alignment, pruning) and charge closure image; post-rain sensory details (wet earth, salt breeze) mirror internal diffusion selectively through POV. Environment guides micro-choices (light from windows reveals pattern).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode unspoken apologies) signaled early, tightens via lace/compass alignment under Accumulative lens to cadence shift reweighting regret. Agency in sustained attention forecloses unresolved path; cost felt in "something had finally loosened." No reversal needed; pressure coheres internally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of slow forgiveness emerges organically from particulars (bonsai shaping, light-diffusing lace); final image ("sky after the storm—still containing... shades of sadness, but opening... toward... light") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (subtle shifts in light/patterns); rhythmic prose matches slow-spoken character, modulates deliberately without head-hopping or withholding. Voice texture purposeful in lyric mode, taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (read-aloud flows with scene breath); metaphors coherent/pattern-taught (diffusion motif). Minor overwriting in descriptive density but no loops/artifacts dulling closure; propulsion aligns with reflective pace.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lace instructions/bonsai patience transforms regret trope; compass-to-chest turn inevitable from established subtlety-seeking. Risks lyric reflection without gimmickry, heightens emotional stakes organically.</comment>
