<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—safe reputation vs. embracing risk—act in the kintsugi choice; final realization earned by repair's awakening glow, embodying regret as tears and trembling hands without label-speak dominance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflection density builds to kintsugi act, culminating in CR closure ("she had redeemed herself") with legible cost in brother's death and her prior dismissals; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Foundry's dripping roof and cooling forge constrain repair (scales collect rain, fire blooms); coin as micro-setting charges final image, sensory details (gold like honey, inner glow) mirror internal thaw without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem legacy/understand coin) signaled early, tightens via kintsugi decision awakening properties, forcing realization trade-off; cost felt in "luminous regret sharp as forge smoke," charging poise under accumulative lens.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of visible fractures healing emerges organically from kintsugi on coin; final image ("golden seams luminous") reweights risk/legacy without moralizing, resonant non-literal answer to safe vs. bold pursuit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with alchemist perceptual signature (metal pulses, elemental thresholds); voice rhythm modulates from grief's patience to brightened glow, diction controlled in "fire kissed water."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; propulsion peaks in repair ("gold moved like honey into wounds"), opening anchors stakes, final line recharges rain motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kintsugi alchemy on fractured zodiac coin transforms grief trope; brother's limits-chase reweighted through her restoration, organic without template echoes.</comment>
