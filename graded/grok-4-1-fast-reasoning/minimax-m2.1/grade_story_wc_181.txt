<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in bewilderment as constant companion since age seven, earning shift to understanding; embodied disquiet tingles spine at closure. Minor abstraction in reflective summaries of inheritance slightly dilutes peak micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure: cameo image of tree, asteroid, understanding figure reweights nonlinear premise with conceptual cost of completed inheritance. Orientation anchored early in orchard/asteroid; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bathroom micro-setting constrains inquiry by sealing against humming radiation, charging final glow/reveal; crystalline trees and cameo edges filter through Mira's priorities. Recurrent asteroid/trees mirror internal reconfiguration in closing image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of completing inheritance tightens accumulatively via question-whisper, forcing agency in asking; disquiet cost legible as spine-tingle before reveal forecloses bewilderment path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance theme emerges organically through fragments and cameo, resonant CR answer in final image reweights "first page meets last" without moralizing; lingering ambiguity in forbidden truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature of cosmic familial patterns; rhythmic modulation peaks in "luminescence faded... image began to emerge," heightening pressure without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors like "honey through a sieve" integrated; minor paraphrase loop in inheritance braids ("backward and forward") dulled one reflective beat but spares closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi orchard/memories and nonlinear family legacy via pistachio cameo transforms inheritance trope; risk in CR image inevitability heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
