<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied grief as "constant luminescence that hurt to look at directly"; contradictory impulses (personal dreams too raw to share) act in scene via basilica rejection; final endurance of folding another crane earned by prior crafting causality with ongoing cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build through crafting beats to CR closure: lantern dream plays then dims, reweighting grief into craft with felt endurance cost in "folding another crane"; orientation anchored early in tea garden; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tea garden's crystalline bushes steaming from cloud-sea and shiver from nearby ascension constrain focus and charge final image; POV-filtered details (crane paper azure like daughter's eyes) integrate into action; recurring gem/tool shapes choices throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contain personal dreams/grief) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via played dream narrowing options to endurance; agency in polishing/folding forecloses sharing path; cost legible in "beautiful and unbearable" torment charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-craft emerges organically from particulars (shadow loss, dream-gem, cranes); final image "built containers for what you'd lost and learned to call the building of them craft" offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting prior motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (grief as light/shards); stable single POV, rhythmic syntax modulates from meditative folds to dream crescendo; purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., folds sequence advances meditation/rite); figurative language coherent and pattern-taught in light/grief motifs without muddle; no loops/artifacts, propulsion peaks at dream playback.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow-detachment fantasy, dream-lantern craft, floating heavens into inevitable CR; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via luminous grief without gimmickry.</comment>
