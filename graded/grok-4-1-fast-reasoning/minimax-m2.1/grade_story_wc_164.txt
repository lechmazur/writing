<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority shines in "She worked by conjecture, piecing together fragments the way a sailor reads scattered clouds," revealing character-particular love of ambiguity under pressure. Contradictory impulses act when she "pushed deeper" into gaps despite imperfection. Final delivery earns closure with fisher's tears as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density builds to CR: "The final image that crystallized was not an ending but a beginning," reweighting loss with fisher's tears as emotional cost. Orientation anchored early in geode. Single scene causality intact, no slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Geode's "prismatic patterns" and hum constrain Maren's perception, amplifying spirals of seeds and glass ripples to charge "gentler now, less interrogation" final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-filtered via residue-reading. Micro-setting (glass, seeds) guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trace path before fade) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via "gaps" deepening to revelation that forecloses death option. Agency in conjecture narrows knowledge with emotional cost in tears. Lens-driven pressure coherent to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of paths as continuation emerges from seed-images shifting to "carried you with him," resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars (gaps, transliteration) build complexity. Final fisher tears elicit honest aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable Maren-limited POV with perceptual signature: notices "hum with residue," biased toward emotional trails. Voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulates in "images flooding through her like tides." Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels: sentences multi-job via integrated image-action. Rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds; figurative purpose-built around light/residue without muddle in peak transliteration. Minor density in opening doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional residue via bird-seeds/geode transforms missing-person trope into continuance CR. Risky lyric world-building feels inevitable in "paths don't disappear" hindsight. Bold, coherent vision avoids generics.</comment>
