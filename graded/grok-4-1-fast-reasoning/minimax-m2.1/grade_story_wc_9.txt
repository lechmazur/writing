<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in ritual actions like pressing palm to cloth amid guilt; final acceptance earned through blood-ink mingling, revealing hierarchy of values with irreplaceable cost. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously without alternating summaries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (swirling currents) builds to CR closure where saucer-cut pain makes release legible as cost in "releasing what never could be kept." Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity; persistent constraint (saucer) shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Saucer crack as micro-setting constrains climax choice (cuts palm) and charges final image with light/blood; sensory hierarchy (visual moonlight dominating) reflects cartomancer's perceptual bias. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover lost time) tightens via density increase to realization; agency in lifting/pressing saucer forecloses accumulation path with embodied pain cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of acceptance over grasping emerges organically from particulars like ink-palm transfer to blood-mingled release; final image reweights premise without moralizing, inviting ambiguity in "debts paid by acceptance."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (onyx-ink veins, mist-rivers) modulates rhythm to pressure; stable single POV filters all through cartomancer's willingly perplexed lens, compression taught early and paid in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels accumulatively; figurative pattern (bleeding time, origami regret) taught early coheres without muddle, peaking cleanly in "pain bloomed upward" without loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy regret in cloud-liminal space transforms motherhood trope via saucer portal; risk in lyric CR heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from ink-hand traditions.</comment>
