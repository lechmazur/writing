<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's psychometry gift yields concrete, embodied interiority via spatial emotional mapping; final renunciation to leave the strip hidden is earned through vision accumulation without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with vision density tightening to CR closure ("Some goodbyes need no audience"); orientation anchored early ("projection booth of the Rialto Palace"); cost legible in Mira's tears and peace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Booth's "hum of unused love" and false floor constrain reading action and charge final hiding; sensory details (brittle reel, rotting seats) filtered via Mira's psychometry bias integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover sisters' goodbyes) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through visions to foreclose completion option; agency in "pushed deeper" yields felt emotional cost at tears/peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unused love as "doorways" emerges via visions/particulars, reweighted non-literally in final image of witnessed rest without moralizing; resonance from "hushed thunder" callback.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (emotional architectures in 3D); rhythmic prose modulates from "quiet violence" to soft cadence; purposeful compression in visions legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (thunder, incubation) without muddle; propulsion peaks in vision clarity ("lyrics began to surface") charging closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh psychometry-on-film premise transforms trope of hidden artifact into emotional residue architecture; risk in lyric visions pays off with inevitable CR hindsight.</comment>
