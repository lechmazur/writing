<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in her profession, with concrete interiority in psychometry visions like "the man in rough wool," driving micro-choices to delve. Final renunciation ("She would not return") feels earned by prior threshold collections. Minor lack of shown contradictory impulses slightly tempers exceptional status.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from factory hush to lagoon CR, reweighting her stake with conceptual cost in "nothing to capture here" and "She would not return." Orientation anchored early (factory ridge). One tightening via compass psychometry suffices; cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains (factory closure rises water table, enabling fissure descent) and charges closure ("basin of impossible blue"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: scents prioritized. Limestone architecture mirrors internal dissolution purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture threshold essences) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to deepening realization at lagoon. Agency in delving forecloses capture with on-page cost (empty vial). Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: thresholds dissolve into "geography of silence," resonant in final image reweighting collections without moralizing. Particulars like petrichor source avoid platitudes. Counter-reading (completion vs. loss) lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (scent/hush bias). Lyrical rhythm modulates: short sentences heighten cavern echo. Diction controlled, prose-as-character reflects stillness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; minor figurative density ("ghost of rain... where industry has exhaled") in opener purposeful for lens, not obscuring. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clean to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Petrichor collector premise fresh, synthesized with psychometry/lagoon source organically. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in CR without gimmickry. Irreplaceable conceptual turn inevitable from particulars.</comment>
