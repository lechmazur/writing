<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in cynicism vs. intuition, embodied in aching scars and crystallizing tears that pressure micro-choices; final drawing from heart is earned by prior failures. Blind spots on superstitions drive struggle without tidy resolution. Flaws like shame over crystals complicate until integrated into ink.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from stillness to rain/thunder, culminating in RR via successful runes with cost of shed cynicism. Orientation anchors early (platform, Elara's role). Single scene, no shards, closure legible in "runes held—luminous and perfect."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating platform trembles under knee, constraining ritual amid storm; canyon clouds and ozone taste mirror internal pause, charging final image. Crystals as body-setting enable ink integration. Sensory hierarchy reflects scholar's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform scars via runes) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to realization-forced drawing narrowing academic path. Agency in "let herself remember" forecloses cynicism with vulnerability cost. Rain escalates pressure coherently under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wounds-to-stories emerges via scars/crystals/quill shifting from curse to ink, resonant in final image without statement. Complexity in superstition's validity lingers. Protagonist arc inextricable from question of honest wounds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature ink-stained dreams and ozone; rhythm modulates from stillness to drumming rain. Compression purposeful, taught early, legible at rune-drawing closure. No head-hopping or leakage.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: varied rhythm accelerates to "quill moved with purpose" peak without loops or scaffolds. Figuratives like "crow quill... sharp enough to cut through illusion" cohere, no muddle. Zero artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fantasy synthesis (crystals as grief-ink, floating platform ritual) feels inevitable; tropes transformed via scars-superstition calculus. Risky lyric internality heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
