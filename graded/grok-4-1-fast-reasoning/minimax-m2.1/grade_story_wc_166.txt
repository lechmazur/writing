<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Earned reconfiguration peaks in "anchor within her dissolve like salt in rain," tying motives to release with embodied cost, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, leaning declarative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density cadence to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "did not weep, though she had expected to feel grief," reconfiguring exile without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Twilight garden constrains liminal act ("boundary between worlds grew thin enough to see through") and charges final image under stars; sensory selectivity (insects' hum, pale flowers) mirrors internal rite.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (outlast ban via verse) deepens accumulatively through breathing ritual narrowing to press; agency forecloses old rhythms with felt lightness cost at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image reweights exile as "arriving" via pulsing verse heartbeat, emergent from particulars without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in gaps as invitations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (tidal rhythms biasing notice) with rhythmic syntax modulating to charged poise; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but figurative density ("glimmered with both silver and shadow") borders overwriting in ritual beat without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic tide exile into verse rite feels inevitable; risk in lyric form heightens resonance of "tide always returns" without gimmickry.</comment>
