<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as preserver is rooted in consistent traits like patience, shown through micro-choices (key selection, awkward descent despite chains); interiority concrete via decoding catechism. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9; endurance earned but flawless resolve limits ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry to vault breathing, tightening via soldier anticipation; Charged Poise closure ("patient and strategic, a liberator still bound but no longer broken") reconfigures with felt cost of patience/disguise. Orientation anchored early (Mira in carnival post-wall); single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (clinking chains, cool green air, dust motes) filters through Mira's priorities; piano bench/keys and prize wall constrain access choices. Final aisles image charged by dormant potential mirroring stakes; recurring carnival relics (stuffed animals, rubber balls) evolve via slide/opening without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve seeds vs. soldiers) signaled early, accumulative escalation via access sequence narrowing to post-soldier planting; agency in decoding/entering forecloses immediate planting with patience cost. One tightening sufficient; visible price (chains, timing) alters tactics legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of resilient diversity vs. control emerges organically from seed smuggling, piano map, final "stubborn miracle refusing to die"; resonant non-literal closure reweights monoculture threat. Subtext in carnival/prize irony enriches without moralizing; complexity in regime's crumbling illusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (strategic survivor noticing survival codes in keys/arrow); rhythmic prose modulates tension (staggering grace to deliberate darkness). No dialogue; diction purposeful, lyric compression taught early via image density pays off at vault breathing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in descent vs. flowing aisles); no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("dust motes dancing like memories") purposeful for textural lens, not muddling peak (soldier anticipation); propulsion ties to action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: seed vault in carnival coded via piano keys transforms dystopian tropes through grounded details (smuggled in heels, synthetic feathers); risk in chained grace/non-action closure heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight from border wall premise to resilient planting image.</comment>
