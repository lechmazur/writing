<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Asa's mechanical embodiment and patient motivation shine through concrete details like "deep gears of her mechanical heart," revealing character via reactions to identities; lacks on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, reducing to strong but not exceptional under 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from daily retrieval to final serenity; Charged Poise closure in "permanent shore" lands with conceptual cost of eternal migration accepted, orientation anchored early in atrium description.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal channels and wintersun constrain cataloging to tide-levels and charge final image; sensory integration like "salt-thick air" and "soft whir of centuries" reflects POV priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving identities via routine signaled early, tightens accumulatively to smelting and welcoming; lacks visceral opposition or narrowing options, keeping pressure coherent but static—no reversal forecloses live path with trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wonder woven into routine emerges via smelting contradictions into leaves, resonant CR in final "permanent shore" reweights identity premise without moralizing; subtext in acceptance avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with tidal rhythm and perceptual signature ("names shifted like fish") stable in third-limited POV; diction modulates serenely, no elision or head-hopping obscures closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels via image integration; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "migrating current" risks muddle but stays voice-motivated without loop or scaffold dulling final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical librarian smelting identity contradictions transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric stasis heightens thematic stakes, inevitable in hindsight via routine magic.</comment>
