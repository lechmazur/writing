<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the unexplainable theft of the crystal ("He did not know why he had taken it"), compelling the final renunciation with visible cost in accepting silence's fullness. Interiority particular through pattern-obsessed perceptions. Flawless under single-POV defaults; weathered innocence earned without epiphany dump.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observations builds to CR closure in placing the crystal back as light hits, reweighting language's end as completion with conceptual cost ("silence was not the absence of speech but its most honest form"). Orientation anchored by para 1. One tightening via crystal's amplification suffices; no shards or multi-POV violations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library as organism constrains choices (crystal from chandelier, shelves as vines) and charges final image (seventeen unnamed colors). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (sonic reflections over visual initially). Micro-setting crystal evolution integrates perfectly; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode growth pattern) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via crystal to stance crystallization at end. Cost legible in foreclosed accumulation ("fullness that could hold no more"). Quiet agency in endurance/renunciation fits lens; minor abstractness in stakes dings from 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of growth/completion emerges organically from library-as-organism and crystal whispers, final image resonant non-literal answer ("holding the space where all language had finally come to rest"). No moralizing; ambiguity in "reaches and retracts" lingers authentically. Reweights premise without thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (growth patterns in architecture/dust). Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates perfectly to charged poise ending; no head-hopping or filter excess. Voice as character: reticent precision builds to innocent smile.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud (short punchy realizations amid flowing descriptions); high density integrates image/action. Minor paraphrase loops in reflection blocks ("pattern of growth") cost -0.2, but no closure touch or artifact stacks. Propulsion clean to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: library as living organism + sonically reflective crystal decodes linguistic silence uniquely. Risky lyric closure ("seventeen colours that had no names") heightens stakes inevitably. No template echoes; transforms end-of-language trope organically.</comment>
