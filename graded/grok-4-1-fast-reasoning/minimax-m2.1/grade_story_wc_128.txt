<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the envelope moment—"cargo broker instincts told her to leave it, but her grandmother's voice"—earning the final reconnection choice with relational cost; Elias as secondary pressures via shared backstory without overwhelming.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup from concert to library discovery to office talk, landing CR closure in final image of "cycles of compassion turned quietly... like ships finding their harbor"; orientation anchored early in lobby, no debt; persistent envelope constraint shapes tactics to charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Library "shelves rose... like the hull of an inverted ship" and starlight concretely filter Maren's maritime POV, constraining her lingering and discovery while charging final street-walk image; sensory hierarchy (salt, jasmine, paper, lavender) purposeful without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconnection tightens accumulatively via envelope find forcing micro-choice to search, deepening in Elias talk to foreclose isolation path; cost felt in midnight clock and emotional reciprocity, though agency leans passive post-initiation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of invisible hands emerges implicitly from net-mender/copyist parallels, resonating in final non-literal image of annotated program and locket repro without moralizing; subtext in silences charges CR reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in maritime metaphors ("tides... like letters," "hull of an inverted ship") modulates rhythm under rising connection pressure; dialogue natural/subtextual when present, distinguishing voices without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety (long sensory builds to short dialogue bursts), no loops/artifacts; minor overwriting in consistent poetic vehicles ("whispered secret") purposeful for textural lens, but elevated diction slightly drifts from broker lexicon in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of maritime/ musical "silent workers" crucible via misplaced envelope transforms lost-item trope organically; risk in lyric accumulative closure heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
