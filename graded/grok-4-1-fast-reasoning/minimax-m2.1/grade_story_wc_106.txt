<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to borrow moments roots deeply in consistent traits like flower-reading savvy, compelling her lens-pouring choice under fading light; interiority feels embodied in reverent movements. Minor abstraction in emotions like "luminous disbelief" avoids full contradiction under pressure. Man serves as foil without pressure-testing her flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptive density builds to portrait capture; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with conceptual cost in empty jar and man's veiled shift: "something in his expression shifted—a luminous disbelief." Orientation anchors early via station and sunset. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emerald station and shifting light constrain timing and charge final image, with POV-filtered details like camellias mirroring internal states through action. Sensory hierarchy favors light/colors fitting Mira's priorities. Micro-setting via bench and glass roof guides observation without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing/revealing destiny tightens via moonbeam pour narrowing golden-hour window; one deepening reversal in portrait's bloom forecloses unseen paths with felt cost in empty jar. Accumulative pressure coheres without coincidence resolution. Agency in deliberate waiting culminates in earned reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of deciphering fate emerges organically from flower codes and light-shifted portraits; final image of man touching camellias offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting "paths untraveled." Subtext in silences avoids moralizing. Particulars like camellia garden prevent platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice delivers distinct perceptual signature via light/flower biases; POV stable with no head-hopping, modulating rhythm from reverent to charged poise. Compression of moonbeam ritual taught early pays off legibly. Psychic distance tightens at man's glance without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in lines like "poured it carefully over her camera lens" advancing multiple jobs; figurative language patterns via light motifs without muddle or loops in peak beats. Minor density in descriptive runs fits taught lyric mode without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh magical realist synthesis of thief, moonbeams, and flower destinies transforms observation trope into destiny-revealing agency; risk in non-causal accumulative closure heightens conceptual stakes. Irreplaceable camellia garden image feels inevitable from early codes.</comment>
