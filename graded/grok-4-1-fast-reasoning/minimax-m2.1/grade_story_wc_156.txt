<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between methodical certainty and sonic curiosity act in scene via timed brushwork and sitting pause; final renunciation of restoration-as-fixing earned by coin's pull and awakenings with visible cost in shifted vocation. Interiority particular through sound embodiment; flaws (prior blindness) drive compounding recognition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echoes, coin, nested realizations tightens to CR closure ("completing a conversation") with conceptual cost legible in "exchange certainty for curiosity" line. Single scene, orientation anchored early; persistent sound constraint shapes final image without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden's parabolic echoes constrain brush timing and coin reveal, charging final image of sound washing over her; recurring pool/fountain handled tactilely. Sensory hierarchy sound-dominant via restorer's ear; details evolve causally from pebble drops to musician's listening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoration vs. sonic communion) signaled early, deepens texturally via coin's sound-pooling and awakenings narrowing to pause choice; agency in prying coin and sitting forecloses prior certainty with felt price. Escalation coherent under lens, cost unmistakable in vocational reweighting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of truths in sonic pauses emerges organically from coin-mural dialogue and awakenings; final brush pickup offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting restoration without moralizing. Subtext in musician's listening face avoids platitudes, complexity lingers in playful infinity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with sound-biased perceptual signature; voice rhythm modulates from methodical to infinite, diction controlled and lyric. Experimental compression of echoes taught early, legible at charged closure; no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., echoes as pulse/body/memory); rhythm varies, no loops though "awakenings" echoes purposefully. Minor overwriting in "nested awakenings" simile cluster, but coherent and peak-charged without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic architecture, Depression coin, and mural communion transforms restoration trope; risk-taking in textural build to CR heightens stakes via irreplaceable garden logic. Non-obvious musician's listening payoff inevitable from particulars.</comment>
