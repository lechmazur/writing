<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Embodied emotion shines in trembling hands working through shakes with "daringly methodical patience"; internal conflict between self-blame and graffiti wisdom drives earned stasis. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "self-forgiveness" edges toward therapy-speak without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing closure via graffiti reweighting breakdown as "flood"; cost legible in final acceptance of unapologetic flow. Orientation anchored early by platform and maps; single scene fits defaults flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivy "like green veins carrying life into old bones" and graffiti as "sediment" constrain arrival and charge final station-mapping image. Sensory selection reflects chronicler's bias toward waterways and survival cartography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of post-medication self-reclamation tightens via graffiti phrases narrowing blame to endurance; agency in holding bellows forecloses playing with felt continuity cost. Escalation coheres accumulatively without reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>River flooding motif emerges organically from graffiti to reweight breakdown without statement; final bellows texture offers resonant non-literal answer on brokenness-made-beauty. Ambiguity lingers in "fragile edges" without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in riverbank precision applied to graffiti and ivy; rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive to charged introspection seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful river echoes; varied syntax propels from entry crunch to final "raw solace." Minor paraphrase loops in reflection beats (e.g., floods repeated) dull peak slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of graffiti wisdom in derelict bathroom as recovery map transforms mental health trope; bellows' palimpsest repairs feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
