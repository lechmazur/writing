<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Specific synesthetic interiority and motivation rooted in David's loss compel the breakthrough choice with biological cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing on trust ("million small erosions") abstracts peak emotion slightly, but micro-choices like prototyping align traits under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of absences/images builds to CR closure: "quiet settling" realization reconfigures trust/sound premise with legible cost ("ten years left"). Orientation anchored immediately; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse/shipwrecks/forge constrain prototyping and mirror absences thematically; sensory hierarchy (sounds of colors/wood/green) biases via POV, evolving with currents. Forge charges final image as breakthrough site.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sound trust) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via method-deepening to agency-driven realization; cost (time/body) unmistakable in cells/ten years. One tightening forecloses via earned insight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of "hearing the end" emerges organically from synesthesia/absences/David; final aurora/hope image offers resonant CR repricing without moral. Particulars (silences symphony) reweight premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with distinct perceptual signature (color-sounds as chimes/tearing); rhythmic modulation heightens reflective pressure, prose texture biased/selective. No POV slips; elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (aurora "pages tearing") patterned via synesthesia; no loops/artifacts, rhythm varies. Minor overwriting in opening density slightly slows propulsion but coheres.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional engineering/sunken orchard/ashen forge transforms synesthesia trope; underwater trees/forge flames risk bold world logic charging closure. Irreplaceable premise angle on loss.</comment>
