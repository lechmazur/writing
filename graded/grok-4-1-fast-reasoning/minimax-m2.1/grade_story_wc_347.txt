<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's reluctance as inherited "transfer of weight" roots consistent traits, intensifying to compel descent; contradictory impulses peak in "reluctant heart stirred," earning assembly choice with embodied cost of family curse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: birds' signal → blueprint recall → timed descent → nut assembly yields DC closure with frost cost legible in "birds knew... frozen metal meant nothing"; single scene, lens coherent, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cliffside orchard/labyrinth constrains descent via textures/temperatures matching blueprint; mechanical birds' cries pressure tactics; final assembly "like a flower" charges image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save travelers pre-frost) signaled by cries/signal, tightens via timed descent/assembly under bird insistence; agency in micro-choices forecloses failure path with legible frost cost, though secondary travelers remain off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Burdens of inheritance emerge via particulars like "weight" transfer and silent passage; final "warm darkness" reconfigures duty's graceless toll without moralizing, though ambiguity lingers obliquely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias (texture/temperature focus); rhythmic prose modulates tension—"shuddered once, twice"—under stress; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/images like "gnarled trees bending... as if still trying to escape"; minor metaphor density in opening ("wound that refused to heal") risks overwrite but coheres without loops or drift at climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical birds/herding curse with heartseed key transforms maze trope; risk in "impressions without touching" method heightens ingenuity, inevitable at assembly payoff.</comment>
