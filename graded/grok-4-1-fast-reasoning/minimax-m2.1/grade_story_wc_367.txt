<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solid interiority and embodied joy in laughter anchor motivation, with endurance of isolation as earned stasis. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene prevents 9+; prophetic gift feels seamlessly integrated without visible tradeoffs in peak guiding moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from wick ritual to ship steering, culminating in Charged Poise CR: final laugh reconfigures herald role with isolation cost legible in "his reason for remaining." Orientation anchored by para 1; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emerald lighthouse and glass wick constrain choices (climbing, feeding light) and charge final green fire blaze. Sensory hierarchy via keeper's prophetic gaze selective and purposeful; stars/sea mirror internal communion without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guiding ships via joy/focus escalates accumulatively as vessels appear one-by-one, narrowing to perfect silence/whispers; agency in laughter/words forecloses dark fates with felt isolation cost. One tightening sufficient; no live losses but pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of accidental architecture from routine emerges organically via laughter-seeds and ship nudges, resonant CR in sky smiling back reweighting prophetic burden without moralizing. Particulars like newspapers anchor complexity over platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in light-bending diction and rhythmic swells matches prophetic mind; POV stable single focalizer. Compression purposeful and taught early, heightening joy under pressure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "laughed...world rearranged"); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwrite in repeated laughter motifs purposeful but edges template cadence; no loops obscuring closure, metaphors coherent (internal reflection).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism prophet via refraction/laughter transforms lighthouse trope organically; risk in post-newspaper isolation heightens stakes. Final sky-smile turn inevitable from established pattern, no derivative echoes.</comment>
