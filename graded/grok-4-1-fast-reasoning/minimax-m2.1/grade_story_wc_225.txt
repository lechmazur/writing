<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exemplary single-POV interiority with concrete embodiment (fingers "winnowed through the tapestry's border thread by thread") revealing contradictory impulses—avoidance of patterns yielding to productive decoding. Final renunciation of guilt earned via prior causality in her exile backstory, anchored to present tapestry cue, with visible cost in hands "finally still." 9+ test met cleanly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early and holds: density builds via decoding beats toward CR closure in "fierce repose" image, reweighting exile as permission with undeniable conceptual cost (trial accusations undone on-page). Orientation anchored by ~100 words (frozen village, her exile). No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint of stopped time shapes final cadence shift as thunder ends.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Environment (frozen village, platinum labyrinth) constrains choice (approach during lull) and charges final image (labyrinth gleams as villagers move, mirroring her internal thaw). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: thunder felt as "sacred" lull, selective to her chess-pattern mind. 9+ test: recurring thunder object reconfigures stasis to motion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness vs. guilt) signaled via labyrinth avoidance; accumulative tightening in tapestry decoding narrows options, forcing renunciation with legible emotional cost ("mind quiet... since the trial"). Protagonist agency drives under lens; one decisive deepening suffices, charging Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (sacrifice > survival, reframed failure) emerges organically from chess/tapestry particulars, protagonist arc inextricable; final image ("walked through it with fierce repose") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting prior accusations. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "permission" vs. punishment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (patterns as "calculations," fidgets as "productive"); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive breath to clipped realization under rising thunder pressure. Prose texture character-specific, no leakage; elision of backstory cued by objects pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (e.g., "Her fingers moved with the fidgets productively habit... while her mind plotted" advances character/action/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; minor overwriting in opening weather imagery purposeful for textural lens, untouching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: frozen-time village + chess exile + self-decoding tapestry transforms redemption trope via lived pattern-reading logic. Risky lyric compression (time-lull frame) heightens stakes coherently; final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
