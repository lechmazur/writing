<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's observant trait drives concrete micro-choices like analyzing dust patterns over shaft inspection, with embodied interiority in peripheral vision of the presence; final engagement feels earned by his echo-reading compulsion. Minor telling in backstory ("weightless burdens he carried without complaint") slightly abstracts emotional contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations densify from lights dying to dust, mainspring, presence, hatch outline; Charged Poise closure ("reached for the edge of the hidden hatch") reconfigures options with felt cost in settling burden. Orientation anchors early; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dust patterns and plaster cracks constrain choices by revealing hatch/air movement, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (flashlight cuts dust, temperature drop) reflects Marcus's priorities. Circus posters and collapsed shelf tactilely mirror abandonment without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover echoes) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via dust->mainspring->ceiling presence; agency in climbing counter forecloses routine inspection. Cost legible in insistent pressure and hummed spring reweighting narrative unwind.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of hidden stories/echoes emerges via particulars like dust waves and mainspring potential, resonating in final hatch reach without moralizing. CR reweights "what ceilings hide" with conceptual cost of endless replay vs. discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in reading "stories" from cables/dust/echoes; rhythmic diction modulates from observational calm to insistent pressure. No head-hopping or withholding; elision absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., flashlight sweeps integrate action/atmosphere); varied rhythm passes read-aloud. Minor overwriting in metaphors like "frozen lightning" risks muddle but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator tech seeing echoes (not ghosts), horologist barrel in circus, dust forensics; risk in Accumulative ghostly poise pays off in inevitable hatch reveal without gimmick.</comment>
