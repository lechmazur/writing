<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority anchored in embodied details like "trembling hands" and micro-choices of arranging driftwood; motivation to harvest insights drives endurance with felt cost of penance. Minor slip in over-articulated epiphany ("failure was not a single moment but a long process") borders diagnostic but ties to present vigil without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from walking/markers to flute vigil and CR closure ("some guardians were meant to act while others were meant to witness"); cost legible in reweighted understanding foreclosing intervention path. Orientation anchored early; single scene fits defaults with one tightening at Listener's Crossing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly filters through POV with sensory hierarchy (echoes overriding speech, dust motes); Thunder-echo constrains solitude/reflection and driftwood enables markers charging final constellation image. No generic placeholders; micro-setting of flute/body integrates purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest insights from failure) signaled early, tightens texturally via uncasing/vigil to stance crystallization; agency in deliberate steps/markers forecloses prior paralysis with penance cost felt on-page. One meaningful deepening suffices; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of witness vs. intervention emerges organically from particulars like unplayed flute and echoed memories; final image offers resonant CR reweighting guardianship without moralizing. Subtext in silence implies complexity; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (echoes/memory intertwining); rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate steps to canyon hush intensity. No head-hopping or withholding; elision of backstory anchors to present cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and purposeful syntax; minor overwrite in metaphors ("dust motes...tiny suspended worlds") slightly dulls but doesn't obscure closure image. No loops or scaffolds; read-aloud propulsion strong in vigil beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic fantasy with introspective canyon vigil transforms tropes via echo/texture; final constellation markers offer earned ingenuity growing from particulars. Bold poetic risks heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
