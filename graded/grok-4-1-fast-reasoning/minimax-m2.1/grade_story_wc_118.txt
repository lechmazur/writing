<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's perceptive oddness roots motivation consistently, shown in tactile probing of fragile pages and shifting tapestry dragons. Interiority concrete via ash language and frequencies beyond perception, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Renewed urgency feels earned without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: diary entries and tapestry accumulate density to Conceptual Repricing closure where stories reweight dreams' loss with felt world's tilt cost. Orientation anchored early in silo chamber. Single scene fits defaults, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silo's wheat-smelling concrete curves and half-burned fireplace constrain probing action and anchor discoveries. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: ashes yield diaries mirroring internal cracks. Final warmth in hands charges image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (comprehend dream-loss) signaled early, deepens via Miriam's dragons to reweight options toward story-collection endurance. Accumulative tightening legible in pulsing tapestry heartbeat. Cost felt in displaced axis tilt pressing walls.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of stories as new dream-fuel emerges from diary-tapestry particulars, not statement. Final image reconfigures guardians' failure with hope in threads, lingering ambiguity on ancient breach. No moralizing; counter-reading of sealed vs. drained viable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: shadows crawl, gold threads shift at eye-corners. Rhythmic texture modulates from quiet pressing to pulsing warmth. No elision or head-hopping; diction character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion: "fingers that had learned the language of ash" advances character/action. Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; minor motif repeats ("displaced axis") purposeful. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dreams as fuel against dream-space ancients, guarded by backward-burning dragons, spun via silo stories. Risky post-dream world logic commits fully, transforming tropes organically. Inevitable hindsight from Voss-diary to tapestry pulse.</comment>
