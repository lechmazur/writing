<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in lifelong study compels precise micro-choices like peeling paint layers; interiority concrete and embodied in ruby flake's pulse and urgency's weight. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene, with smooth competence over struggle. Final realization as candidate earned but misses hairline internal friction for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from door resonance to mural revelations tightening to stairway materialization; on-page closure as Resonant Reconfiguration with felt time cost in "dawn approached... window started to close." Orientation anchored early in palm on door and midnight sally. Persistent time constraint shapes tactics through ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "grass that hummed with harvested starlight" and waterfall's shifting colors filter through lore keeper's priorities, constraining choices via closing window. Pavilion paint layers evolve causally with peeling action; environment charges final crystalline spirals image. Micro-setting (palm press) pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to claim transformative throne signaled early, deepens via murals revealing candidacy and time pressure narrowing to precise palm press; agency in patient peeling forecloses haste path with urgency cost. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens with density shift, but single tightening misses micro-reversal for peak band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom as bridge past/future emerges organically from mural depictions and ascension, reweighting throne from dominion to custodianship in final image without statement. Particulars like paint layers shifting meaning avoid platitudes; resonant non-literal answer in "stepping into a future that remembered the wisdom of the past."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature in scholarly noticing of "smallest symbols" and "residual energy"; rhythmic prose modulates from patient description to charged dawn ascent. Perceptual bias selective and consistent; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "boots crunching on grass that hummed with harvested starlight" advancing setting/action; rhythm varies purposefully without loops. Minor overwriting in stacked descriptors ("teal and gold and deep violet") in opening but integrates without muddling closure; "grew炽热" proofreading slip nudges from 9.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic sci-fi in liminal orchard and throne as transformation gift; tropes like ancient door transformed via paint-peeling method and patiently bold seeker. Risky futuristic nostalgia tone heightens stakes organically; core premise feels inevitable in hindsight without derivative templates.</comment>
