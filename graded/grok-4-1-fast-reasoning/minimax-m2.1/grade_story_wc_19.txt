<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (bunker prison vs. trellis freedom) act in scene through micro-choices like placing doll; final endurance of dual worlds earned by prior realizations with emotional cost of unrecognized embrace. Exceptional interiority particular to Mira's sensory-biased perception. No safety-hedging in flaws like hope-exposure risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences/revelations builds to CR closure in final image of pulsing doll against heart, reweighting limitation with conceptual cost of carrying gilded hush into bunker. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one deepening via gravity's return tightens to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Trellis barrier and railing constrain placement of doll/shoot; porcelain doll as micro-setting charges final pulse image. Sensory hierarchy (visual fog, tactile wood crack, auditory susurrus) reflects Mira's silence-collection urgency, integrated into actions without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect silences vs. inherited fear) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through embodied paradoxes to foreclose fear-limited path; cost legible in gravity's pull and dual-reality endurance. Agency in climbing/placing choices narrows options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of limitation-as-growth emerges organically from doll, shoot, silences without statement; final image reconfigures prior bunker premise non-literally ("build trellis not bunker") with lingering ambiguity of father's incomprehension. Resonance from particulars like "flavors of different silences."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature of paradoxical phrasing ("too tight and too loose"); rhythm modulates from expansive wonder to contracting gravity cadence. Prose texture (syntax echoing inversion) reflects Mira's mind without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering ("clouds like sleeping sheep," "gilded hush") taught early as pattern; no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion, though minor density strain in reflective opener slightly tempers peak clarity. Rhythmic variety supports read-aloud ear; closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inverted-gravity garden, living doll, silence flavors transforms tropes into inevitable CR; risk in surreal xenial trellis heightens stakes organically, no hedging or templates.</comment>
