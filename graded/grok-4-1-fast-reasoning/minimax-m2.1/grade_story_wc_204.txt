<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional single-POV interiority with concrete embodiment (fingers tracing frost, ink-stained hands) and earned change: Elara's preservation instinct compels her to press the bottle, foreclosing compression for release with Library-wide cost. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in old craft vs. world's softening. No unearned epiphanies; flaws (isolation as last operator) drive discovery without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: frost pattern directs causal chain to bottle discovery and press rupture as Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise, with undeniable cost in Library shudder and new growth need. Orientation anchored early (~80 words). Closure image ("press groaned with familiar purpose") reconfigures eternity's release legibly on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting as micro-constraint: frost patterns guide path, letterpress provides "absolute certainty" enabling climax action. Glass orchard and cloud-sea charge final image, evolving causally (shuddering panes). Sensory filter (tactile ridges, ink sweat) character-particular, mirroring internal expansion without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating ancient whisper) signaled early via frost; accumulative deepening narrows to press choice, forcing trade-off between holding and releasing eternity. Escalation via density increase culminates in rupture with visible cost (systems destabilize). Agency in platen press forecloses compression path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (eternities resist compression) emerges organically from frost syntax to rupture expansion, reweighting premise in final image ("world would learn to listen") without moralizing. Rustling motif shifts from contained to liberatory, charging closure with conceptual cost. Invites ambiguity: preservation's limits.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical 3rd-close POV stable, with perceptual signature in craft-sensory bias (type ridges, platen resistance). Prose texture modulates rhythmically to rupture's cascade, building urgency without head-hopping. Diction purposeful, voice as preserver's patient etching.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels accumulatively; varied syntax/rhythm peaks at "cascade of syllables...contain forever" without loops or muddle. Figurative language pattern-taught early (crystalline trees), coherent payoff at expansion. Zero scaffold; every line multi-jobs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Surreal premise (negotiable reality, bottled pre-Negotiation whispers) synthesizes fresh world-logic with letterpress anchor, transforming preservation tropes. Risky lyric compression inevitable in hindsight via frost-press arc; closure reconfigures rules boldly.</comment>
