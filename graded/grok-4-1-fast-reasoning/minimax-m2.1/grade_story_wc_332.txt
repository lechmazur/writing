<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation roots deeply in stubborn persistence and affection, intensifying to personal dream-capture via concrete experiments like the child's photo vitalization. Interiority shines in embodied listening akin to sailors' marginalia, with micro-choices like palette tests revealing values. Minor slip in epiphanic crystallization ("quality of being") feels slightly unearned amid accumulative texture, but prior causality supports endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from palette accident to runaway dream threading stacks, culminating in Charged Poise CR where dream settles ("finally captured, finally home") with conceptual cost of resolved ache. Orientation anchors early (library on archipelago). One tightening via personal recognition reconfigures stakes without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Whispering archipelago and library constrain choices (isolation enables odd hours/sunrise rituals); sensory whispers mirror internal listening, sunrise pools charge vitalizing. Recurring palette-as-tool evolves tactilely, mirroring longing. Final hanging photo integrates setting into charged image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vitalizing dreams) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to personal runaway dream, narrowing via failed incompleteness (child's photo). Agency in painting sequences forecloses generic longing with her own reconfiguration cost felt in "constant ache of absence." Minor abstractness in stakes softens visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of lost dreams seeking rest emerges via particulars (marginalia, vitalized photo movements), reweighted in final image where Mira's longing settles without moralizing. Subtext in whispers and light paints emotional residue, inviting ambiguity on ongoing work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close yields perceptual signature (noticing beyond-hearing, light-absorbing colors), rhythm modulates from hushed observation to luminous peak. Compression purposeful, taught early via wind voices, legible at closure. No head-hopping; diction biases toward residue and dreams.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (e.g., "cipher of longing revealed itself slowly"); purposeful repetition ("hush of improbable beginnings") bookends without loops. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("weaving through the image and drawing out") during climax slightly muddles propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism (light-painting dreams from photos) transforms longing trope via palette's light-absorbing physics, risking lyric fantasy that heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight in personal mirror-moment ("her own face in the mirror of another's capture").</comment>
