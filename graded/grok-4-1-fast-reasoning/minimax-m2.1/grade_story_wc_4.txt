<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through photo-handling actions, revealing reverence for broken things; motivation to remember intensifies subtly via archival taping. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, with serene endurance untested by crisis; no micro-choices under pressure foreclose a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from photo withdrawal to taping/alignment, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("case light with the knowledge... thread in larger tapestry") with conceptual cost of ongoing practice. Orientation anchors Maren/setting immediately; single scene coherent without shards or transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lavender field and rusted ruins integrate tactilely, mirroring internal states ("scent mingled with metallic whisper") and charging final image ("lavender swayed... rust and resurrection"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (archivist notices arcs, fractures); recurring stone/map case constrain her settling/work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmute forgotten pain) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through taping gaps, narrowing to endurance of incompleteness; agency in patient attention forecloses forgetting. Escalation mild—one tightening via alignment—but lacks live option foreclosure or visceral price beyond felt gratitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of pain-to-masterpiece emerges organically from particulars (torn faces, tape, footprints in snow); final image reconfigures via "collective healing... practice," resonating without moralizing. Subtext in gaps left for grief invites ambiguity; no tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (languages of broken things, arcs as luminous); rhythmic modulation builds lyric poise. Voice distinct in syntax ("vines climb, slowly"), prose as character reflects calm perceptiveness; no dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose vivid but overwriting in metaphors ("tiny lanterns," "hummingbird with broken wings," "footprints in snow") clusters during key taping beat, muddling density (−0.7); minor paraphrase loops ("dove gray map case" thrice, "transmuted" variants). Rhythm varies but elevated diction borders whimsy excess without peak compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist as healer via photo arcs in lavender/ruins, transforming abandonment trope through perceptual calm; final reconfiguration ("pain... thread in tapestry") inevitable from particulars. Risks earnest whimsy effectively, heightening resonance without gimmick.</comment>
