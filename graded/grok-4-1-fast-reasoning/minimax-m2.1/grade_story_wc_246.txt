<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied ritual with pen and past mistake driving subjective method against protocol; confidently uncertain trait shows contradictory impulses in pursuing dismissed approach. Minor slip in reflective summary of career reroute slightly abstracts emotional cost before closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from tangled signal to emergent response; CR closure reconfigures past errors as filtering with conceptual cost legible in "every wrong turn was a form of filtering." Orientation anchored early at outpost; one tightening via pattern recognition suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly constrains decoding choices throughout and charges final image by filtering signal to essence; pen as micro-setting handled tactilely. Sensory selection (universe "breathe," amber light, warm nib) reflects professional bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode signal tightens accumulatively via contingent tracing narrowing noise to response; agency in patient unraveling forecloses doubt path with felt career cost. Escalation coheres under lens but lacks single sharp reversal, leaning on steady density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of filtering chaos to meaning emerges organically from signal work mirroring life bends; final image resonant non-literal answer reweights premise without moralizing—"strange comfort of uncertainty had served her well."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (signals as breaths, echoes waiting); rhythmic prose modulates from patient analysis to thrilled pursuit under pressure. Purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at CR.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion (e.g., "threshing meaning from experience"); rhythm varies purposefully. Minor paraphrase loops on "comfort" and "bending" purposeful for tone but slightly scaffold closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of signal interpretation as life metaphor transforms sci-fi tropes via pen heirloom and anomaly filter; quiet CR ending risks bold conceptual payoff from particulars.</comment>
