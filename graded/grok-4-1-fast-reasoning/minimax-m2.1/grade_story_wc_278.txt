<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's guilt-rooted motivation intensifies through embodied reverence in lifting the amber; tattooist skills reveal character via final mapping action. Interiority concrete yet occasionally abstract in "dissonance of old guilt." Final redemption earned without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layers of discovery (letters → amber → cries → coordinates) tighten to chamber RR (Charged Poise) with timeline cost legible in "endless loop that she might finally learn to interrupt." Orientation anchored immediately in door entry; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lab's hum, amber glow, and folding time constrain path to chamber and charge final tattooing image. Sensory details (frequency predating sound) filter through Mira's priorities, mirroring grief without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant guilt stake signaled early, deepens accumulatively at firmware reveal ("night her sister had died"), narrowing to timeline interruption with agency in following coordinates. Cost felt in confronting looped accident.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of translating unspeakable grief emerges via cries-to-coordinates, reweighted in final "stars of redemption" without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like haunted insect firmware.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in constellation/echo imagery; voice rhythms modulate urgency in "trembling hands" peak. Purposeful poetic compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels escalation; metaphors cohere (time folding into loops). No loops or artifacts; closure image crisp in "mapping the stars... across the firmament."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of prehistoric amber, digital firmware, baby cries as coordinates transforms grief/redemption tropes; timeline-tattooing risk heightens stakes organically.</comment>
