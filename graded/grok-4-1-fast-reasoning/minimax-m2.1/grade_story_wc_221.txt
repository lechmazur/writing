<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in pariah status and confusion intensifies credibly to sketching choice, with interiority concrete via family ritual and vision. Contradictory fear/reverence embodied in palm against glass moment. Minor deduction for epiphanic summary over simultaneous impulses at peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflective density builds to CR closure in final sketch/vision, reweighting true north with conceptual cost of renouncing control legible in "merged into peace." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent. Cost proof: compass pulse and sketch foreclose fear-driven path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observation deck constrains solitary reflection and glimpse; residual vibration and windows charge final sketch image, mirroring internal shift. Sensory selection (muted footsteps, denser silence) reflects temporal urgency. Recurring compass/sketchbook as micro-setting enable pivotal action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confusion to clarity) signaled early, deepens via glimpse reversal that narrows to exploration stance under Accumulative lens. Agency in requesting solitude and sketching forecloses retreat with felt pariah cost. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of wonder over control emerges organically from sketch ritual evolving to future-oriented drawing, reweighting shutdown via non-literal final image. Resonance in family chain linking past/present without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: temporal bias filters stars/silence uniquely. Prose texture rhythmic, modulating from stretched silence to pulsing warmth; no head-hopping. Voice particular via sky-watcher idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies for emotional beats. Minor loops in "stretched" and "echoed silence" repetitions dull peak slightly (−0.4), but no scaffold obscures closure. Clean syntax, vivid verbs propel to sketch cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal sci-fi with family heirloom ritual transforms tropes via pariah's soul-direction realization. Risky lyric introspection heightens stakes without gimmickry; irreplaceable glimpse-sketch turn feels inevitable.</comment>
