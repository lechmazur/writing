<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via chemist's molecular lens on grief as "polymer chain"; contradictory impulses (lab vs. bedside) act in reflections anchored to chrysalis; final endurance of grief with cost ("does not disappear") earned by scene's micro-choices like kneeling and pocketing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations build density to CR closure: foam insight reconfigures grief with legible cost ("weight...shifted"); orientation anchored early via coordinates and ravine; single tightening via foam-tracing suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Foam patterns and chrysalis as micro-settings constrain insight and charge final image; sensory hierarchy via chemist bias ("surfactants...surface tension"); braided ravine mirrors internal braiding organically through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atonement via grief-processing) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening observations to foam reversal narrowing guilt options; cost felt in bearable grief persisting; minor abstractness in initial stakes declaration tempers peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges implicitly from chrysalis/foam/polymer particulars, reweighting separation=connection without statement; final image resonates as non-literal answer, charging prior motifs with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in symphonic/chemical diction ("spirals within spirals"); rhythmic control modulates from reflective to incisive at foam insight; stable close-third POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with lines doubling as image/advance (e.g., "foam form and dissolve"); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (symphonic chaos); varied rhythm breathes with insight's cadence shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer grief/river emergence transforms redemption trope; foam-insight turn inevitable from established perceptual bias; bold lyric risk heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
