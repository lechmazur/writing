<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strength: contradictory impulses in aloof wandering versus shell-triggered release earned by prior grief causality, with embodied itch signaling change; minor abstract phrasing in promise recall slightly genericizes peak interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to pool CR closure; shell placement reconfigures "temporary eternity" with legible emotional cost in final witnessing image; orientation anchored early in caves/quay memory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pool's luminescence and still reflection constrain kneel/place choice and charge shell image; sensory selection (echoing darkness, splash) mirrors internal suspension purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief-blocked creation vs. promise) signaled early, tightens accumulatively at shell/pool reversal changing knowledge/options; agency in release forecloses possession path with felt cost, though internal more than external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shell motif shifts from capture to release, offering non-literal resonant answer to beauty's impermanence without moralizing; theme emerges organically from particulars, reweighting quay/painting arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (observing isolation "from a great height") with rhythmic modulation; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at pool payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm/syntax, but minor paraphrase loops in permanence/fragile phrasing (e.g., "illusion of permanence revealing itself as the fragile construction") dull two peak sentences without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artist grief via cave-mystic shell promise transforms block trope; risk in lyric CR closure heightens thematic stakes inevitably from wandering particulars.</comment>
