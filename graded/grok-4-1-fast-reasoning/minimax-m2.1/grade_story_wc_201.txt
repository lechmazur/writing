<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of shame and survival embodied in "body had betrayed her, trembling and sweating," compel final endurance at clearing with visible cost in trembling body.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density to CR closure in final para's "price she had not yet calculated," reconfiguring mercy math with conceptual cost legible in clearing image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Proprioceptively sensed body and UV forest constrain walk, charging final clearing image; "colors that existed only in the space between what eyes were meant to see and what they could survive" mirrors internal damage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mercy calculus tightens accumulatively via strap's hum narrowing to forward poise; protagonist agency in not removing it forecloses return with felt bodily cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mercy in questions emerges organically from body-memory walk; final clearing offers resonant non-literal reweighting of premise without moral, recharging "rooted to her own devastation."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in enhanced senses and math diction; rhythmic modulation peaks in "hum, a frequency she felt in her teeth" under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in sensory integration; no loops or artifacts, rhythm varies naturally to charge closure image without overwriting in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi enhancement and philosophical mercy math feels inevitable; risk in lyric accumulative form heightens stakes via body-as-constraint to charged poise.</comment>
