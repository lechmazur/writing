<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between masked over-seeing and bare peripheral trust act in pavilion sitting; final endurance of endless tending earned via prior causality with isolation cost felt in "someone had to remember."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from dune murmurs to pavilion echo; CR closure in "long walk back" reconfigures preservation duty with conceptual cost of perpetuity legible in recurring tending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pavilion's bone-white columns and whisperfield calm constrain reflective pause; parapet oscillations shape movement and charge final wind-murmur shift mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of boundary preservation tightens accumulatively in pavilion realization, narrowing to eternal endurance; minor abstractness in cost legibility prevents higher band, but agency in patient conjuring forecloses forgetting path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of echoes persisting in boundaries/dunes emerges organically; final image of mask adjustment and parapet return offers resonant answer to preservation question, reweighting child's future query without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature of "faint geometric pulse" and peripheral sensing biases all notice; rhythmic control heightens meditative pressure, stable close third-person limited with no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory image and action without loops or scaffolds; varied openings propel from "murmured, though not with wind" to closing "long walk back" with perfect cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of line-walking kinetics and prophetic residue transforms desert trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens eternal duty stakes, inevitable in hindsight via dune-memory premise.</comment>
