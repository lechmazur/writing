<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority via patient worldview and embodied listening (crouches low, eyes level with coins), but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; serene endurance earns closure without deeper embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from coin-casting to static burst; CR closure lands cleanly in realization sentence ("purpose was not to predict... but to witness"), with felt cost of patient endurance legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory filter (ambered light, static crackle, coin vibration) through POV bias; deck table and coins constrain choices, charging final image indirectly, though minor visual overreliance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (aligning with purpose) signaled early, textural deepening via burst and vibration narrows to witnessing; agency in distilling forecloses prediction path with conceptual cost in smile moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of retrospective recognition emerges organically from coin/static particulars, reweighting contraction premise in final image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to understanding question via patient witness stance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (static as language, wavelengths); stable close third-person POV modulates subtly with intensity, rhythmic control heightens quiet pressure throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but minor paraphrase loops ("quietly enthusiastic," "distilling") and repeated "patient" in peak beats dull closure edge slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of contracting universe, coins-as-vibrations, and backwards prophecy feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric sci-fi frame transforms tropes, heightening stakes via textural closure.</comment>
