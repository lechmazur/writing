<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in stillness forced by dust-mapping versus accident-trauma avoidance, embodied in "small revolutions of light and particle"; final trust-realization earned via process without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup to CR closure; "voice that emerged... bloomed and withered" reconfigures trust with impermanence cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Skylight/dust motes as micro-setting constrain mapping choice and charge closure image of flowing songs, filtering through Eleanor's particulate bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconstruction deepens via method evolution under accumulative lens; playback forces renunciation of rigid expectation, with felt cost in song's "fading."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final lullaby image offers resonant answer to inheritance-of-loss question, reweighting songs as "flowing" practice without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-close POV with perceptual signature on crystalline "melodies... pressed into stone"; rhythm modulates from patient accumulation to charged bloom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "seventeen distinct sonic traces"; varied rhythm, no loops, metaphors consistent without muddle in peak playback.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of pigeon legacies encoding grief in meteorite crystals transforms tropes; risk of sonic-mineral premise inevitable in hindsight via dust-model payoff.</comment>
