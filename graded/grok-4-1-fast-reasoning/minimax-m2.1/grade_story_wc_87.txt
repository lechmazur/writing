<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory melancholy and merriness embody internal conflict during paddling, with micro-choices like pole alignment earning final endurance; laugh crystallizes hierarchy of values without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of poles and regrets builds to Charged Poise closure in laugh and course adjustment; cost legible in foreclosed old navigation, poles as constraint reweighting options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Coastal details like granite boulders and osprey nest constrain choices via shore gravitation; poles recur to charge final seaward pull and gathering light image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of post-accident navigation tightens accumulatively through uneven strokes to current's pull, forcing endurance agency; laugh moment crystallizes stance with felt cost of past collapse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of regrets' backlash emerges via particulars like poles as waypoints, resonating in non-literal laugh that reweights persistence over collapse without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with navigational perceptual signature (e.g., poles as milestones) and rhythmic modulation during emotional shift to merriness; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density in lines like "compass warmed against her skin" propels without loops or artifacts; varied rhythm accelerates to final paddling cadence cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Poles-as-navigation transforms disability recovery trope into fresh, grounded ingenuity; quiet accumulative risk heightens emotional stakes organically.</comment>
