<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in trembling hands lifting the egg against her "steel spine," earning the final release with sacrifices as felt cost; interiority particular via bird-holding memory anchoring present choice. No unearned epiphanies or label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of crafted sanctuary builds to Charged Poise closure ("walked away without looking back"), reconfiguring her driven stasis with undeniable sacrifice cost legible in final image; orientation anchored early in salt flat expanse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Salt flat constrains incubation via sun/cold cycles and sterile emptiness ("no life to threaten"), charging final egg image; sensory selection (eye-hurting white, crack-map) reflects urgency and POV bias without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (successful resurrection) signaled early tightens via timed thunder and drought-crafted sanctuary, forcing release renunciation with agency-driven trade-off; cost unmistakably layered in personal forfeitures charging poise at "trusting the environment she had so carefully crafted."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fractured grace theme emerges organically from amoral acts yielding sentimental echo-preservation, resonant non-literal answer in egg's lonely wait reweighting god-playing premise without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in hero-villain fracture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (song as "second heartbeat," light on egg as "promise") biases noticing; stable single POV with rhythmic modulation under pressure, no head-hopping or withholding; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "thunder rolled... atmosphere seemed to hold its breath" varies rhythm for urgency); zero loops, coherent metaphors (veins pulsing like promise), no artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of drought-engineered resurrection transforms extinction trope through sentimental calculus; risk in quiet release heightens fractured stakes, inevitable in hindsight from crack-map to egg poise.</comment>
