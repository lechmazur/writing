<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chief archivist's motivation to preserve vows intensifies through embodied tension ("breath catch") into earned reconfiguration of purpose; contradictory dread and revelation act simultaneously in the measurement beat. Interiority particular via ingrained "quartz hush," flaws in meticulous limits drive competent struggle without hedging. Final recording choice forecloses magic-preservation path with conceptual cost of surrender to story.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density tightens from fading glow to transformation revelation, culminating in on-page CR where vows evolve to memory with legible conceptual cost ("magic surrendered to simple story"). Anchored early (observatory dome); one deepening via resonator suffices. Final shift reconfigures options, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen library's micro-setting (frost-etched floors, suspended lattice) constrains meticulous steps and charges final image of clouds' "slow pilgrimage"; sensory hush hums evolve with internal states. POV-filtered details (frequencies only trained ear detects) mirror priorities without tourism. Dome and clouds frame closure poise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve fading vows) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via resonator's new frequency emergence narrowing to meaning-over-magic trade-off. Agency in precise adjustments forces stance crystallization; conceptual cost felt in "edge of oblivion." Minor abstractness in initial stakes keeps from 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of magic-to-memory preservation emerges organically from slide's gold-to-story shift, reweighting premise in final "stubbornly luminous persistence" image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars (resonator patterns) invites ambiguity on illusion vs. essence. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice texture (varied rhythm, "crystalline silence") stable in close third POV with perceptual signature of frequency-attuned hush; compression taught early pays off in charged closure. No head-hopping, diction modulates precisely with revelation intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated images ("embers refusing to surrender"); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops/artifacts, syntax breathes with scene (short precise sentences in measurement). Zero figurative muddle, propulsion peaks in transformation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vow-frequency classification transforming to story-preservation feels inevitable from emotional resonance setup; risk in lyric fantasy heightens stakes via conceptual cost. No derivative echoes, particulars (glass slides pulsing oaths) transform tropes organically.</comment>
