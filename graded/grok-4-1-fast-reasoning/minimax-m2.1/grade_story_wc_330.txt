<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silent carpenter's persistent nature compels slow approach, rare song, and reverent gathering, earning final calling with embodied quietude. Interiority concrete via hands "that knew wood the way others knew words." Subtle contradiction in frozen persistence yielding to purpose without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wind bells chime through discovery to Charged Poise closure—"held the fragment and let the silence speak, knowing that in its quiet spaces, everything was possible"—with felt cost of infused purpose reconfiguring prior stasis. Orientation anchored early in workshop. One tightening via song's harmony suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pines curving "protectively shielding," mossy ground, halo's "filigree of vines and stars" constrain slow kneel and charge final holding image. Sensory hierarchy carpenter-specific (sawdust/velvet to gleaming fragment). Purposeful selection mirrors internal repair without overt symbolism; spatial choreography clean through wrong turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence as possibility) signaled early, accumulates via bells' sign to song/reversal where fragment pulses, narrowing to restorative agency. One deepening forecloses aimless persistence with cost felt in "misting hush" companionship. Fits lens; visible trade-off charges poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of restoration from fragments emerges via halo's gleam shifting from void to promise, resonating in final image without moralizing—"whispering gleam into every surface." Particulars like pulsing response reweight silence's meaning organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in silence-as-possibility bias ("interpreting silence as possibility"). Rhythmic prose modulates from persistent calm to song's profundity; purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "shaping curve and flange in conversations不需要言語的寂静中" blends action/voice); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwriting in halo description ("gleam intensifying as if the metal itself recognized") risks figurative density but pattern-taught, no loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of derelict circus craftsman finding celestial fragment transforms abandonment trope into restorative poise. Halo-carousal fusion inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in bilingual fragment and lyric hush heightens stakes organically.</comment>
