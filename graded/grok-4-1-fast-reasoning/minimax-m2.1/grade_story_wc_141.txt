<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between debunking drive and emerging regrets, embodied in trembling after first hum; final renunciation of professional despair feels earned via accumulating visions without safety-hedging. Minor reflective summaries slightly abstract emotional progression pre-closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cello touch to layered visions tightening personal stake; CR closure in final image reweights career premise with inward cost legible in "she would leave this place without a scientific explanation."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cello and shell as micro-settings constrain choices and charge final image; sensory details like "salt and sawdust" and "dust motes" mirror decay-to-wonder shift through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant debunking stake signaled early, deepens via repeated hums forcing inward turn with agency in sustained engagement; cost felt in foreclosed explanatory path, though escalation leans more textural than sharply narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of demystified magic vs. human unsaid emerges organically via visions and spirals; final image offers non-literal repricing—"compass of human connection pointed... inward"—recharging priors without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature shifting from skeptical ("straightforward explanation") to wondrous; rhythmic control heightens density without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but overwriting in metaphors like "photograph developing" and proofreading artifact ("убегая от") slightly muddle late clarity without touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-busting undone by personal cello-echoes transforms tropes; risk in lyric CR heightens inward stakes organically.</comment>
