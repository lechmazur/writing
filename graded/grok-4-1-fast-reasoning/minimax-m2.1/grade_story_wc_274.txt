<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses peak in trembling hands holding the letter, compelling the transmission choice with felt loyalty cost. Minor slip: reflective summaries slightly abstract duty vs truth before dramatized resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelation density tightens to Charged Poise closure in transmission initiation, with legible cost in shifting silence; orientation anchored early in library/snow. Single scene causality intact, no slips touching ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Echoing footsteps and falling snow constrain Kira's isolation and charge final image of silence transforming from shroud to held breath. Sensory hierarchy (visual snow, auditory echoes, tactile cryogenic chill) filters through archivist POV without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve vs reveal) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via revelation deepening that forces transmission renunciation with duty cost legible in "hands that had stopped trembling." Minor abstractness in initial stakes declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truths demanding breath emerges organically from letter's desperation and final ripple, reweighting preservation mythology without moralizing; snow/quiet images shift meaning non-literally at close.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in silence-obsessed noticing; rhythmic modulation builds to charged ending diction without head-hopping or withholding. Lyrical compression taught early, legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence lengths to propel from quiet to "networks sang"; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("small apocalypse," "frozen well") slightly muddles one mid-beat without touching closure. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh cryogenic archive frame transforms manufactured war trope via lover-commanders' letter, with risk-taking in quiet internal arc heightening thematic stakes organically.</comment>
