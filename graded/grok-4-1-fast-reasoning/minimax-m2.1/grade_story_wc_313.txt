<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in water-as-language perception and boot grooves embodiment; motivation intensifies credibly to final renunciation of silence, but minor summary of "silence was a kind of violence" abstracts conflict slightly from micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via revelations tightening to CR closure; final "stories would remain above the surface" reconfigures erasure premise with conceptual cost of inevitable reflooding legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sapphire label and receding shallows constrain path (mud-embedded find) and charge final pocket image; selective sensory hush (muted chimes, mirrored dawn) mirrors internal resurfacing without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory reconstruction signaled early, deepens accumulatively through photo trail and bottle cache narrowing options vs. bureaucratic reburial; agency in arranging photos forecloses silence with felt communal cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emergent theme of memory vs. hydrological erasure answered non-literally in photo arrangement and gleaming label; reweights particulars (tavern sign, home walls) with ambiguity of future floods lingering purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (water's intentions, stone grooves) sustained in third-limited POV; rhythmic modulation builds hush to crystalline poise without filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image integration; proofreading slips ("brittle快照", "she spin") and minor erasure-synonym churn ("expunge"/"erase"/"submerged") dull propulsion in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drought-resurfaced town via personal artifacts (photos, intact corks) transforms erasure trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
