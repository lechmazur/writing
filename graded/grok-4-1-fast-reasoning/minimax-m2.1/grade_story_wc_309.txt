<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's interiority shines in embodied reluctance to report the keystone and tracing its details, revealing contradictory acceptance of her role versus feeling "seen"; final realization of preparation feels earned with cost of shedding spire life. Micro-choices under pressure show values hierarchy without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase from ward flicker to mist dissolution and garden arrival; CR closure in "keystone to complete its simple, sacred architecture" reconfigures underachievement premise with legible cost of foreclosed automated path. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via keystone touch suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystalline walls, frost-etched light, and mist seeping "as if they were merely suggestions" constrain calibration and enable dissolution; recurring luminance charges final sky blaze, mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of underachievement vs. found magic signaled early tightens via mist acceptance narrowing options to transcendence; agency in effortless mist walking forecloses spire duties with felt cost of "shed skin." Escalation driven by protagonist under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sacred-in-simple theme emerges organically from keystone's serenity, mist patience, and garden folly image reweighting automation premise without statement; final paradox of "brilliant dimness" offers resonant non-literal answer to underachievement question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in "beautiful in the way that forgotten things are beautiful"; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in garden without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, and motif without loops; varied syntax propels from calibration sputter to "sky blazed with brilliant dimness," though minor overwriting in light descriptors slightly dulls peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of automated magic era with keystone triggering organic transcendence; risk in mist walking's effortlessness heightens stakes, transforming trope into inevitable CR without gimmickry.</comment>
