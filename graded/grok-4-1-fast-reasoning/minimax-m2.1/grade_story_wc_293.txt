<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fiddler's interiority is concrete and particular, rooted in bridge gigs and vanishing silences, culminating in earned realization of her life's testimony. Micro-choices like tucking the flake reveal values under pressure. Minor reflective summary slightly abstracts peak embodiment, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pullout observation to flake revelation as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting vanishings with "pixelated amnesty" cost in luminous disbelief. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure image of waving hitchhiker pays off scaffold pattern with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Selective sensory details like wind in firs and gravel flake constrain revelation and charge final shimmer. Micro-setting (flake, case) guides choice and mirrors internal fracture/reassembly. POV bias filters mountains as song-like, evolving with emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of probing the vanishing tightens accumulatively via flake's image, narrowing to amnesty reconfiguration. Agency in holding flake and driving on forecloses doubt with felt shaking/disbelief cost. One deepening suffices; minor abstraction in reflective phrasing doesn't dull peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of shattered truths reassembling emerges from flake image and bridge silences, offering non-literal answer in hitchhiker's wave dissolving like snow. Subtext in scaffold map and glass oils charges without moralizing. Final image reweights prior vanishings organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in luminous observations like "luminous beads on a dark string." Brief hitchhiker dialogue natural/subtextual. Rhythmic compression heightens flake moment without head-hopping.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and image layering; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "frozen moments that never quite溶解ed" purposeful and coherent, taught early. Closure line's "song that had never learned to end" recharges without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fiddler lore, collodion ghosts, and scaffold cartography transforms vanishing trope into pixelated return. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via iridescent impossibility.</comment>
