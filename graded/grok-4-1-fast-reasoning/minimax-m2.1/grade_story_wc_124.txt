<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied shift from "aromatically cautious" fear to true grief at "She grieved for him now, truly grieved" earned by prior micro-choices like vial handling; contradictory caution and need propel closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR closure in bloom's heart revealing "molecular memories," reweighting loss with legible emotional cost; single scene oriented early, no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>UV rays fading and moss-muffled steps constrain timed action, charging final glowing bloom; sensory hierarchy (scent/light over others) reflects POV priorities perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake deepens accumulatively from vial uncork to petal unfurl to filament glow, narrowing to grief acceptance; one tightening forecloses avoidance, cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief as "shape of caring" emerges via scent-triggered memories, resonant CR in empty vial's purpose without statement; reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature in phrases like "scents carried tears in their molecular structure" stable under pressure; rhythmic modulation heightens revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density in "petals beginning to unfurl in a slow spiral that seemed almost deliberate"; propulsion varies rhythm without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesis of scent-memory preservation in extinct plants transforms grief tropes into inevitable CR; fresh broker role heightens stakes organically.</comment>
