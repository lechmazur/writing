<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in inheritance and curiosity drives persistence across seasons, culminating in earned revelation; interiority particular to artist's perceptual bias. Limited contradictory impulses shown through action, but micro-choices like spreading postcards reveal values under pressure. Final brush pickup forecloses doubt with felt time cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via postcards and frost patterns to CR closure in cathedral window revelation, reweighting premise of unseen beauty with patience cost. One tightening at "pressed her face close to the glass" moment anchors discovery. Orientation clear by para 1; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pavilion's etched glass constrains discovery and charges final image via light-etched layers mirroring internal revelation. Sensory details (frost tracings, slanted light) selective through POV, evolving with seasons. Cathedral window as micro-setting pivotal in climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (night-bloom mystery) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to glass revelation narrowing intellectual options; persistence costs time/seasonal endurance. Cost legible in "months trying to understand"; no reversal needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unseen flourishing emerges organically from postcards to window map, resonant CR in "profound patience required" without stating moral. Final shoots image reweights prior mystery non-literally. No thematic echo or moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature artist-specific (colors pulsing, light showers); rhythm modulates from contemplative to revelatory. Prose texture controlled under reflective pressure; no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in stacked light/color metaphors (e.g., "warm, fragmented showers") slightly dulls peak revelation without obscuring. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: inherited postcards encode floral-lunar map via salvaged chapel window, transforming artist trope through specific celestial revelation. Risk in seasonal elision pays off in CR; no derivative echoes.</comment>
