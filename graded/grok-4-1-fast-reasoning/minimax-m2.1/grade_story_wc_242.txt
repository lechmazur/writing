<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and embodied grief (tunnel rhythms, frequency of loss) root clear motivation; micro-choices like never correcting callers reveal values. Earned endurance in her practice shows change with cost. Minor deduction for reflective summaries over simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds patterns of wrong numbers and echoes to Charged Poise closure in harmonica/phone ring, reconfiguring estrangement as generative loop with felt repetitive cost. Orientation anchored early (Mira in tunnel at dusk). Single scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tunnel's concrete/copper veins and ventilation constrain isolation, mirroring stakes; harmonica disc charges final image as resonant object. Sensory hierarchy (acoustics, hums) reflects POV priorities without catalog. Details evolve causally with air pressure shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witnessing endings via wrong numbers) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through pattern recognition of loops. Agency in cultivated listening forecloses connection with estrangement cost. Legible pressure in repetition, reweighting to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of endings as doorways emerges organically from particulars (crosstalk calls, harmonica echo); final image offers non-literal resonant answer via loop repricing without moralizing. Subtext in cultivated estrangement invites ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (tides, frequencies, haunts) modulates rhythmically; stable close third-person limited. No head-hopping; diction biased to Mira's acoustic expertise. Compression purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (short final sentences charge poise). Purposeful metaphors (grief as frequency) integrate without muddle. Minor dense figurative layering in opening risks opacity but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forgotten infrastructure, wrong-number grief loops, and haunted instrument transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric frame heightens resonance; premise non-obvious, inevitable in hindsight via copper arteries motif.</comment>
