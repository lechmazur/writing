<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's moral ambiguity concretely embodied in whittling mother's forbidden flowers despite self-admitted unworthiness, with contradictory grief/joy impulses acting via narrated whittling; final blank defiance earned by prior micro-choices gaming the speakers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as whittling densities reflections toward Charged Poise closure at window (blank face amid turbines), with legible cost in preserved void; single scene anchors orientation by para 2, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Turbine shadows rhythmically crossing floor and hum framing whittling constrain isolation/defiance, charging final window image; bouquet/knife as micro-settings handled tactilely mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve grief-hush vs mandate) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via whittled rose completion narrowing to announced "performance" stasis; agency in endurance forecloses joy/grief paths with void-cost felt at "weightlessness of having survived both."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of regulated emotions emerges organically from narrated tasks vs blank face, reweighted non-literally in final turbine-watch as "grief, made light"; resonant ambiguity lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theatrical internal voice ("The knife descends") distinctively biases perception toward performance amid hush, modulating rhythmically with whittling pressure; stable first-person distance heightens defiance without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm (e.g., "curl spirals free like a falling thought"), no loops/artifacts dulling closure; purposeful lyrical figures integrate without muddle in peak whittle beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of happiness dystopia with performer gaming tonal compliance transforms tropes; risk in "remade hush" defiance via whittling inevitability heightens stakes, voice commits fully without hedging.</comment>
