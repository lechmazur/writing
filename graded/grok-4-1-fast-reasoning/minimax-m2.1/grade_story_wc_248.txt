<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to free knowledge evolves credibly from arson to preservation, rooted in lineage and "analytically intuitive" trait that enables discovery; final three-year commitment forecloses normal life with felt cost. Interiority concrete via embodied tracing and passion, but limited on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of artistic discoveries builds to Conceptual Repricing where burning reconfigures as preservation, with legible cost in time isolation. Orientation anchored early (Mira, library fire, 17 months later in Archive); smooth shards via time markers teach pattern without disorientation. Closure image of emergence charges prior acts undeniably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archive murals and vandalized portrait constrain choices (tracing releases mechanism) and charge final image of fulfilled lineage tapestry. Sensory details (ancient smoke, firelight shadows) filtered through Mira's priorities integrate purposefully, mirroring internal passion without static catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfill promise amid hoarding world) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via trail to portrait discovery narrowing options to preservation. One deepening (matching fragment to portrait) forces stance shift; visible cost (three years underground) alters tactics legibly under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge preservation vs. control emerges organically from arson-library contrast to Archive lineage, reweighted in final emergence without moralizing. Returning faces/tapestry motif shifts meaning at end, linking acts with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (art as language bias) modulates rhythmically; diction like "volcanic tenderness" reflects mind under passion. No dialogue; purposeful compression of time shards legible under Accumulative lens, charging closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid rhythm (varied sentences, purposeful repetition of "promise"); no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("thread tied around her heart") purposeful for tone, integrated without muddling peak portrait reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art-as-map consciousness guide transforms lost civilization trope via women's lineage guardian pattern; risk in reflective shards heightens thematic stakes. Non-obvious reweighting of arson as preservation feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
