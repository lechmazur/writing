<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Concrete interiority in acoustic readings and embodied strikes reveals particular prophetic traits; endurance of gift/burden earned but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as strikes layer density to charged poise closure in final pulsing euphony image with conceptual burden cost; orientation anchored early, no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Driftwood orchard constrains strikes and acoustics while sea/wave charges final harmony image; selective sensory hierarchy (sound primacy) mirrors POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prophetic translation stake deepens via accumulating strikes and wave transformation under textural lens; agency in timed mallet forecloses discord with harmonic cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Obstacles-as-instruments theme emerges organically from strikes to final reconfiguration; resonant smile/image answers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with acoustic perceptual signature; rhythmic syntax modulates textural build without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene but repetitive "strike/resonance" phrasing and conceptual paraphrase loops (e.g., layers/sound multiplication) reduce density in mid-build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sea xylophone orchard transforms mystic trope via acoustic specificity; final euphony pulses riskily from particulars.</comment>
