<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solitary POV shows concrete interiority in "tracing the silence between the brook's murmurs as though reading braille made of absence," rooting motivation in mother's folds and prophecy as vibration. Earned change from hushing to receiving warning without consumption via micro-choices. Lacks overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hush density builds to pattern break where "the code unfurled like the origami wing," delivering CR closure as prophecy reweighted to plea with conceptual cost of smoothed future unwritten. Orientation anchored early at brook's edge. Persistent silence constraint shapes tactics to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brook's "whispers fading into the vast倾听" and frogs quieting constrain ritual choices, charging closure as wing settles with "barely a disturbance." Sensory hierarchy reflects POV's silence-mapping priority. Micro-setting (brook/stones) mirrors internal hush without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to hush prophecy tightens accumulatively as hush reaches environment, deepening to hear "desperate plea" that forecloses blind obedience. Agency in inviting wing and listening; cost felt in reconfigured precognition. Entry to 8+ via trade-off, but single intensification suits length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of prophecy as tunable frequency emerges organically from ripple analogy and hush-weaving, resonating in final "tranquil blaze" image reweighting destiny to wisdom without moral. Counter-reading (warning absorbed, not erased) adds ambiguity. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with perceptual signature in "water whispered secrets to stone," modulating rhythm to hush density. Compression taught early via folds pays off in wing's unfolding. No head-hopping; diction fits summoner's subtle craft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density in lines like "a gentle, persistent current, like water finding its way through countless small stones," with purposeful metaphors pattern-taught around flow/silence. Varied rhythm propels to closure; zero loops, scaffolds, or muddle in peak hush beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms summoning trope via "prophecy as frequency" hushed by silence-mapping, with origami wing/terrestrially cosmic angle risking lyric boldness. Closure's "threads waiting to be rewoven" feels inevitable from prior hush particulars. No derivative hedging.</comment>
