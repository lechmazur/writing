<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied details like the thread's warmth against her thigh and contradictory reverence for farewells amid her own stranding; motivation to map absences compels the closing endurance of staying with felt cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing in reflections slightly abstracts peak realization, but micro-choices in writing earn the final renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptive density builds to Charged Poise closure: "She would stay... first stroke of the map" reconfigures her lateness with conceptual cost of self-absence. Orientation anchors early; single scene coherent with legible pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden's clipped hedges, birch bark "peel[ing] like pages," and light patterns constrain her projection and charge the final image of mapping healing's contours. Sensory details tactile and selective, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping healing's geography deepens accumulatively via writing beat, narrowing to stance crystallization in staying; cost legible in foreclosed departure. Agency in intimate projection forces trade-off with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of explained absences emerges organically from thread, palace echoes, and her writing, reweighted in final image without moralizing: staying as "beginning of healing" answers central question resonantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature—farewells as profession, absences as maps—modulates rhythmically; POV stable, compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels reflective beats; metaphors like leaves as "whispered confessions" cohere without muddle, enhancing closure image. No loops or scaffolds; ear-test rhythm breathes with scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obituaries-for-living profession, evidentiary thread, and healing geography transforms missed-ship trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens inevitability of closing reconfiguration.</comment>
