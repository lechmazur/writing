<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to connect and be heard roots deeply in shared balladeer identity, compelling her encoding and singing choices with embodied sensory detail. Interiority feels particular through her "balladeer's ear" recognizing patterns. Mild flaw: internal conflict leans reflective rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the climax singing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from ghost patterns to graffiti encoding to harmonic singing closure (RR/Charged Poise). Final image—"tinkersong wonder spilling from every stone"—reconfigures options with conceptual cost of refusal to fade, legible on page. Single scene anchors early (Mira in courtyard by para 1); no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Misty courtyard above clouds and flower press bolt plate constrain choices (listening, encoding via phosphorescent graffiti that fades by dawn). Recurrent mist/lightning filter POV perception, mirroring isolation. Final harmony charges bolt plate's "mechanical precision," evolving causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (articulate unspoken needs) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via three-night calls to lightning-channel clarity, narrowing to Mira's singing agency. One tightening: encoding forces micro-choice under urgency, foreclosing silence with felt cost in "pure stubborn will." Climax harmony crystallizes stance without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trans-void articulation emerges organically from particulars (code patterns, graffiti, harmony), reweighting premise in final "echo of a song that refused to fade" without moralizing. Subtext layers via ghost predecessor's embedded echo, inviting ambiguity on hearing's cost. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature (melodic patterns in light/code via balladeer's senses); single POV stable, modulating rhythm with intensity. Syntax reflects drifting alertness in fluid clauses. No head-hopping; purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "loose threads catching every vibration"), rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor deduction for metaphor density bordering overwrite in climax ("mechanical precision... organic chaos"), but pattern-taught and legible. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ghost-in-code balladeer harmony via graffiti/code synthesizes fresh angle on transcendence, transforming tropes through tinkersong premise. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via bolt plate reprise. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
