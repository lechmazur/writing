<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of detachment and deep feeling act simultaneously during inhalation; final realization earned by prior self-testing causality, with embodied cost in rearranged interior world. Strong perceptual flaws drive competent struggle without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup to CR closure: "half truths had always been whole lies if she was honest, but useful ones, necessary ones"; exact cost legible in conceptual acceptance that forecloses absolute honesty. Orientation anchored early in grotto; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber grotto walls and ethanol scent constrain sensory immersion and charge final glowing image; sensory hierarchy reflects chemist POV (static on blotter prioritized). Details evolve causally from dusk to night, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (perfect emotion transfer) signaled early, deepens via transformation completion and inhalation under Accumulative lens, narrowing to personal cost in "rearranged the furniture of her interior world." Agency in self-testing forecloses detachment fully, with felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of useful fictions emerges organically from half-truths motif, reweighted in final exhale without moralizing; resonant CR answers fusion question via conceptual cost of lies-as-medicine. Particulars like autumn leaves scent ground complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (static as emotional residue); rhythmic modulation peaks in subsumption beat. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "amber and grief, a melancholy that tasted of autumn leaves"); minor paraphrase loops in "professionally thorough/detached" deduct but purposeful for voice. No artifacts dull closure image; rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh premise synthesis of olfactory emotion dealing transformed via static-sensing idiosyncrasy; risk in affectionate detachment heightens stakes. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars, no derivative hedging.</comment>
