<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied emotion excels in "vibrations travel up her arm and settle somewhere behind her sternum," revealing character through micro-choice; interiority concrete and particular. Minor unearned epiphany in "She understood then" borders therapy-speak but doesn't flatten pressure. Final change earned via accumulated trials with felt cost of enduring deafness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as vibrations and realizations density-build to CR closure: "numbness was not a wall but a door," with undeniable cost in "never hear the way she once had." Orientation anchored early in cavern arrival; one tightening via active trials suffices. Persistent constraint of broken needle shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Phonograph body and cavern skins constrain choices (palm placement, hanging rows stir with seasons), charging final forest image where "shadows pooled and light spilled." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: muted air, vibrations over visuals. No generic placeholders; details evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeat numbness) signals early, escalates accumulatively via demo to "recording after recording," narrowing to bodily navigation with agency in cranking. Cost legible in persistent "hush" reconfigured. One deepening at "filament of hush... waiting to be touched" forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-door emerges organically from vibrations motif shifting meaning, resonant in final forest image reweighting premise without moral. Minor slip: last sentence's future-telling borders summary (−0.3). No overt statements; complexity in accepting hush's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in vibration-filtered noticing ("through bone and tissue"); rhythmic control modulates from muted to stirring wonder. Stable third-limited POV, no leakage. Prose texture purposeful, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "time seemed to pool rather than pass" advances atmosphere and theme); rhythm varies naturally. Minor figurative density in opening but coherent, no muddle or loops. Propulsion clear, no scaffold; closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Backward songs on broken needle transform deafness trope into fresh vibrational premise, inevitable in hindsight via drum-maker logic. Risky lyric hush-tone heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; synthesis of phonograph ruin and reversed melody feels singular.</comment>
