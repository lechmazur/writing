<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's phobia and stunt irony create embodied contradiction, peaking in "phobia clawing at her throat" as she traces notes under pressure. Final defiance earns change via prior causal buildup. Minor diagnostic tone in epiphanies slightly undercuts immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: shell revelation → library flight → Daniel confrontation → cast decryption → empowered stand. Closure as Charged Poise lands in "I am not who you made me," reconfiguring identity with felt phobia cost. Orientation anchored early in library/skylight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rusted shelves and starlit cast constrain phobia and enable decryption, charging final "shield forged from childhood secrets." Sensory details (cold metal, rust-thick air) filter through Maya's urgency. Micro-setting guides pivotal choice without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim truth amid betrayal) tightens causally via Daniel's advance forcing on-page decryption agency. Escalation narrows options with phobia cost legible in trembling resolve. Minor abstract stakes early, but converges cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-as-strength emerges organically from phobia/stunt irony to final "fear and power could coexist." Resonant non-literal answer in seashell's "voice as her own." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in enduring flaw.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (phobia-heightened senses); voice modulates rhythmically under stress. Dialogue sparse but subtextual in Daniel's condescension. Distinct texture in syntax avoids drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm; overwrought figures like "stars humming" cluster early but purposeful for tone. No loops or scaffolds dull closure. Minor register elevation in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Child's cast as decryption medium transforms betrayal trope ingeniously. Premise synthesis of phobia/career irony feels fresh, not templated. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
