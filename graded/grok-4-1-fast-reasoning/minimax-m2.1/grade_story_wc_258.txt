<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Soren's trembling confession and tape-pulling embody his mapping compulsion against Maren's steady revelation, earning his shoulder-easing endurance with felt cost in acceptance; Maren's inherited poise shows through selective interiority without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via card-laying density building to confession and tape-rolling Charged Poise closure; rain-branching mirrors patterns early, paying off in final image with conceptual cost of repeated historical lessons legible in Soren's "Thank you."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and wooden floor anchor vividly, with branching paths mirroring cards/tape to charge final image; selective sensory hierarchy (grey light on markings) reflects Maren's cartomantic priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping chaos signaled early tightens accumulatively through branching cards revealing systemic failure, forcing Soren's confession agency; cost legibly forecloses reversal fantasy in tape's numbered span reconfigured at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of old mappings illuminating new chaos emerges organically from cards/tape/rain particulars, reweighting crypto hubris via historical patterns without statement; final crossroads card and departing Soren offer resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-close Maren POV with perceptual signature (measuring as first magic) modulates rhythm under confession pressure; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("The cards don't judge") advances without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in card-laying integrates action/image; minor repetition of "inherited mystery" doesn't obscure, but "Maren nodded slowly" paraphrase borders loop without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-crash cartomancy via measuring tape transforms trope of fortune-telling into pattern-mapping with cultural heft; risk in tape's odd ritual heightens stakes organically.</comment>
