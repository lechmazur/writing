<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied fear/wonder ("hair rise on Mira's neck," feet leaving ground) and contradictory impulses driving micro-choice to whisper and step forward; Amari's phone pressure reveals Mira's values hierarchy with earned endurance into the unknown. Final renunciation of skepticism feels compelled by prior pursuit. Backstory anchors present without flattening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from static calls to garden vibration/creature emergence, landing CR closure in "stepped forward into the harmony untamed" with conceptual cost of embracing untamed reality reweighting skepticism. Orientation anchored early (Mira/garden/phone by para 1). Single scene coherence perfect; one tightening via creature silhouette suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Underground garden vividly selective (upward water, floating soil, frost taste) through Mira's priorities, constraining gravity play lifts her and charges final symphony image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under rising pressure. Recurrent moss/vines evolve causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pursue Amari's changed truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via voice-warping, vines uncoiling, gravity intensifying to force stance crystallization in whisper/step with felt cost (foreclosing rational skepticism). One deepening (creature silhouette) narrows options. Agency in descent/pressing on under pressure coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bitterness-to-revelation emerges implicitly via phone confessions and garden response, culminating in non-literal CR final image reweighting "cosmic humor" without moralizing. Subtext in Amari's laugh layers complexity; recurring "changed" motif shifts from loss to embrace with lingering ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect honest via frostbitten possibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with Mira's biased perceptual signature (frequencies making hair rise, frost taste); voice modulates rhythmically under stress (short sentences in creature emergence). Dialogue natural/subtextual (Amari's warped fragments pursue revelation goal); no head-hopping, elision purposeful in static ghosts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "vines uncoiled... responding to frequency" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, read-aloud ear clean. Minor metaphor density in opening ("ghosts of static") purposeful under accumulative lens, no muddle at peak creature beat. No loops/scaffold; concision strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptid lore into "harmony untamed" gravitational pocket with phone-static confessions transforms tropes organically; risk in physics-defying garden heightens stakes coherently. Final reconfiguration inevitable from arrowhead seed, no derivative echoes. Bold voice commits to premise without retreat.</comment>
