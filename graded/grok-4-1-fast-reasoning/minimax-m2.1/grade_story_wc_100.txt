<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Embodied ache behind ribs and stubborn old ways root motivation credibly, with listening micro-choices earning revitalization; internal conflict subtle in persistent ache fading via soul work. Limited simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal underwater scene slightly tempers score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from lens touch to soul gatherings, culminating in Charged Poise RR closure ("lens was whole again... signal that would call him") with felt cost of restored purpose over ache. Orientation anchored early (Pemberton Street, Thursday); one tightening via impossible library suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Water to waist and rib-like bookshelves constrain movement and charge throne-chair work; gray-green light filters sensory hierarchy via undertaker's eye. Final lens glow recharges underwater particulars purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (helping unmoored souls) deepens accumulatively through individual sittings narrowing to permanent rest; agency in "sat with each soul... listened" forecloses confusion with revitalizing cost. Lens signal forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of purpose in death's thresholds emerges organically from old embalming refusal to soul-listening, reweighted non-literally by "ready" final image without moralizing. Lens reprise shifts "distress signal" from broken to eternal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (undertaker's steady hands, tired eyes filtering impossible library); voice texture modulates rhythmically from coffee chill to glowing lens. "Bubble-doubled" words exemplify controlled diction under surreal pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action-image (lens "knitting together"); varied rhythm breathes with scene acceleration to closure. Minor overwrought simile ("bookshelves rose like ribs") in opening library doesn't obscure; no loops touch peak soul work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker summoning via lighthouse lens transforms ghost-story tropes through stubborn ritual endurance; risk of impossible library pays off in charged closure without gimmick.</comment>
