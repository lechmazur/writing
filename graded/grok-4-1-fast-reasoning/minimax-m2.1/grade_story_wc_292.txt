<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via trembling hands during decoding and nail's warmth; contradictory optimism vs. dread acts simultaneously in resolve to publish. Final micro-choice earned by generational vow and institutional risk, foreclosing silence with felt cost. No label-speak flattens peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wheedling access to journal decoding revelation, tightening to Charged Poise closure. Journals' crumbling pages anchor reflection causally to present decoding. Cost legible in "spongey dread seep through her carefully constructed optimism" reconfiguring stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nail and journals as micro-settings constrain decoding choice and charge final palm-hold image. Sensory hierarchy via librarian bias: ink-stained fingers, waterlogged clumps, howling wind mirror internal states tactilely. No white-room; basement/cliffs cohere spatially.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. erasure) signaled early, deepens via decoding revelation narrowing to publish-or-silence trade-off. Agency in patient decoding forecloses institutional complicity path. Cost unmistakable in final wind-screamed dread charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silenced legacies emerges via palimpsest maps and nail vow, reweighted non-literally by final stride image answering erasure's cost. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in researchers' shame vs. family remembrance. Resonance from particulars like coded stanzas.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: maps as "palimpsest of suppressed knowledge." Rhythmic modulation peaks in short, charged final sentences. Prose texture cartographic-specific, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines layer revelation and image without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies from long reflective to punchy "the wind howled... Maren rose." No figurative muddle or template cadence dulls closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography, weather prediction, and generational erasure via reversible exile transforms trope of buried truth. Coded stanzas and nail vow feel inevitable; risk in quiet poise heightens without gimmick.</comment>
