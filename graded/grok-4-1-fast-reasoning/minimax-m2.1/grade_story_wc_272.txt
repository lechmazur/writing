<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and artist-specific ("paint-stained fingers," "geometries that no human bone could justify"); contradictory impulses in questioning self yield earned redesign choice with perceptual cost in "fragmentation became gift."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from scattered cards to woven insight; CR closure lands on-page in "broken tarot box rested complete... no longer needed fixing," with cost of "aching clarity" reconfiguring options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Breathing walls and spiral stairs constrain descent choice, mirroring internal contraction; salt-breathing shelves and floating books charge final emergence image purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fragmentation stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via thread patterns; agency in untangling deepens pressure, cost unmistakable in "aching clarity" foreclosing single-truth art.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of perceptual redesign emerges organically from card-face particulars; final box image offers non-literal answer to rhetorical questions, reweighting curse-to-gift without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with artistic perceptual bias ("watercolors bleeding," "threads woven from light"); rhythmic modulation heightens insight pressure without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and integrated figures ("fog against glass," "luminescence of her aching clarity"); no loops or scaffolds obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tarot-threads mechanic transforms artist-crisis trope into surreal redesign; bold accumulative descent risks fresh perceptual payoff in complete box image.</comment>
