<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Warden's motivation to map sorrow intensifies through patient use of sextant, embodied in tracing walls and scents; interiority concrete via dream-fragments. Minor slip: realization of healing feels slightly epiphanic without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Earned endurance in final descent forecloses ignorance with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ascent to unfolding paths, culminating in CR where labyrinth flattens like fabric, reweighting maintenance as unmaking with undeniable sorrow-cost. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via sextant vision suffices. Final image of descent pays off with legible conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stormlit silver light, wet earth scent, tree roots tangled with bones filter through warden's priorities, constraining sextant use to moonlight. Tower as observatory charges final descent; trees subtly mirror internal mapping. Recurrent labyrinth walls evolve causally in vision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quantify sorrow to maintain) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening as paths unfold under lens, narrowing to physical follow-through. Agency in "deconstruct" forces trade-off: bear full weight. Cost felt in "heal by first understanding the full weight," charging image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow as measurable repository emerges organically via sextant arithmetic and unfolding; final image reconfigures premise—maintenance as unmaking—with resonant ambiguity. No moralizing; trees' witness lingers as counter-reading. Protagonist arc inextricable from quantifying grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: sorrow as "grain of sand," dreams as "cobwebs." Lyrical rhythm modulates from ascent's poise to night's density; diction purposeful, biased to maintenance lens. No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short "pin" trigger to unfolding expanse); high density integrates sensory/motif without loops. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("rivers into mortar") purposeful for voice, not muddling closure. Propulsion clear to final charged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sextant measuring dream-sorrow transforms labyrinth trope into quantifiable repository; risk in lyric unfolding heightens stakes. Trees' witness adds non-obvious inflection, inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual commitment.</comment>
