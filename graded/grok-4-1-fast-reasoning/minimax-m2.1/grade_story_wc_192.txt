<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the shift from "careful amputation" of ties to embracing thresholds, earned by prior causality; final step out forecloses isolation with felt cost. Interiority particularized through embodied recognition of the ring's cold metal. No diagnostic labels dilute peak; flaws like deliberate burning drive inevitable reckoning without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from encroachment feeling to figure's gasping lesson, culminating in CR closure as she steps through door into starlight, reweighting isolation with conceptual cost of "slow suffocation." Orientation anchored early in sanctuary details. One tightening via materializing figure narrows options legibly; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fading threshold and ashen walls constrain choice, charging final image of opening door; selective sensory details (cold brass, starlight) mirror internal states purposefully. Micro-setting of charred timbers guides perception without tourism. No white-room; spatial coherence in threshold evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs. reconnection) signaled early, tightens texturally via encroachment to figure's demonstration of "air and still feel like drowning," forcing stance crystallization. Protagonist agency in non-resistance and door-opening pays cost on-page. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolution; visible price in leaving sanctuary alters path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of thresholds needing "tenderness rather than destruction" emerges organically from particulars like shadows-as-guardians; final image resonates non-literally, reweighting burning as necessary but insufficient. No moralizing; ambiguity in love-as-drowning lingers meaningfully. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual signature (shadows with "patience of scars"); rhythmic control modulates from deliberate layers to charged starlight step. Stable single POV, no leakage; compression taught early pays off legibly at closure. Prose as character reflects tender precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm; minor paraphrase loops like "carefully, methodically" and "slowly, deliberately" in reflection block (−0.3), but no closure touch or filter stacks. Metaphors consistent (drowning/suffocation); syntax varies for propulsion. Opening anchors stakes vividly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow-keeping from severed loves into sanctuary-tomb reconfigures isolation trope inevitably; risk in manifesting past self heightens stakes. No derivatives; particular details like "doorknocker ring... color of old bruises" memorable and organic.</comment>
