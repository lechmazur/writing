<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (guarded walls vs. whale's invitation) act simultaneously in the trembling hands and deliberate laying down; final surrender earned by whale-triggered realization with cost of vulnerability legible at "detaching from the safeguards that had kept her alive."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whale calls build density to cadence shift; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with her stepping into water and heart opening, cost undeniable in final image of whale rising amid bioluminescence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe and scrimshaw as micro-settings constrain pivotal choice (dock safety vs. water mystery) and charge closure image; sensory details (song through bones, cold embrace) selectively urgent and embodied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (embrace true nature vs. guarded safety) signaled early, tightens via whale calls swelling closer under Accumulative lens; agency in detaching scrimshaw forecloses safe path with felt cost of exposure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of surrender over violence emerges organically via whale's combative tenderness mirroring Maren's arc; final image resonantly reweights guarded premise, but closing line's explicit moral ("set down the key") undercuts subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable with distinct perceptual signature (grace amid twilight blurring); rhythmic control modulates from poised description to intensified propulsion in whale's swelling song without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid, integrated figurative language (e.g., "elegy than silhouette") purposeful across beats, no loops or muddle; rhythm varies naturally, propelling to closure without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms pirate heirloom and whale call into metaphor for self-liberation in post-violence world; risk in lyric Accumulative build pays off with inevitable-feeling CR without gimmickry.</comment>
