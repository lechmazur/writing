<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the "first crack" when pearls reflect only his face, rooting his prideful certainty in concrete denial of present details; final endurance of limits feels earned through embodied chest fullness and nine-day shift without tidy epiphany. Contradictory impulses act in scene via failed visions turning to listening. Minor slip: clairvoyant past summarized early without full micro-choice anchor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (tones, shadows, pearls) reconfigures his stake toward presence-cultivation CR, with cost legible in "made small against the vast...now"; single scene anchors orientation by para 2, closure image of glowing pearls/emergence pays off. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt. One tightening via realization sensation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystals' singing and moving shadows constrain realization, charging final pearl glow; sensory hierarchy (sound over silence, bioluminescent green-gold) filters via Varen's visionary bias, evolving causally. Recurrent pearls/cave weather mirror internal shift without overt symbolism. 9+ gate met: setting shapes final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (claim cave's future-purpose) signaled early, deepens via Accumulative density into listening renunciation foreclosing mapping-path with conceptual cost; agency in inhabiting present tightens once meaningfully. No reversal required; pressure coheres to Charged Poise CR. Minor abstractness in "something more" softens legibility slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of foresight-limits emerges organically from pearl-failure and cave-music, final image reweighting premise ("future...garden") with resonant non-literal CR answer sans moral; subtext in disturbed silence hints pilgrim without intrusion. Protagonist arc inextricable. 9+ test: reweights priors without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (sounds as "visible architecture," shadows misperceived then key) biases toward visionary overlay; rhythmic texture modulates to lyric density in realizations. No dialogue. Minor register elevation in "miracle of patience and pressure" fits but borders academic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "cave pearls...warmth, which should not have existed"); rhythm varies, read-aloud natural. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("weather of sound," "invisible corridors") in opening para, but purposeful and non-muddled. No loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alive-cave as distributed awareness transforms mystic-trope via textural teaching, risking lyric over plot; final CR inevitable from pearl-crack onward. Bold perceptual drift (shadows as breathing) heightens without gimmick. 9+ test: non-obvious inevitability with risk.</comment>
