<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to communicate through wood's music rooted in symphonic traits drives patient choices; interiority concrete in crack-as-node perception. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but micro-choices like wedging insulator reveal values under silence's pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building observations to resonant climax; on-page Charged Poise closure in siskin call reconfigures silence with conceptual cost of rarity broken. Single scene anchors early; tightening via cracks' unexpected harmony narrows to world-response.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grove's alder patterns and silence constrain instrument-building and charge final resonance; body/tool (branch/insulator) as micro-setting shapes tactile choices. Sensory hierarchy reflects sculptor's ear, evolving with vibrations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of music in silence signaled early, tightens agency-driven via strum triggering crack-resonance under Accumulative lens. One deepening forecloses failed whisper into harmony; cost legible in grove's lean and first song.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of bridging worlds via vibration emerges organically through particulars; final alders/siskin image offers non-literal answer reweighting silence without moralizing. Subtext in cracks as information charges empathy without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Symphonic perceptual signature (branches as chords) biases noticing consistently; rhythmic prose modulates quiet to crescendo without slippage. Single POV stable, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm; figurative language purposeful in opening but borders overwriting in descriptive clusters pre-climax. No loops or artifacts dull closure image of resonating cracks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of industrial porcelain as natural instrument transforms silence trope; risk in symphonic lens heightens stakes organically, inevitable at resonant payoff.</comment>
