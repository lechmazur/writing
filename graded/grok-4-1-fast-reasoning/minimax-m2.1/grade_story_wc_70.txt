<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's involuntary truthfulness embodies contradictory impulses in her honest doubt ("They won't believe me") against Mira's push, earning her climactic climb and purpose shift with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds revelation density to CR closure when riddle-reading stirs air and flickers lights, reweighting drone premise; one tightening via spiritual insight suffices, cost legible in routine's loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tower's silent reservoir constrains climax ascent and contrasts flickering revival in final image, with nectar dusk filtering Elara's perceptions purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring wonder deepens via riddle realization, forcing Elara's agency in tower climb despite disbelief risk; accumulative cadence shift charges ending with conceptual cost to city's spirit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Riddle and stirring air offer non-literal resonant answer to drone failure, reweighting routine as hope-preservation through Elara's arc without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV lyrical voice with Elara-specific perceptions (truth as "bile," words as "warm honey") distinguishes Mira's certain dialogue, modulating rhythm to pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to closure without loops or muddled metaphors; purposeful figurative layering like "slow dawn" integrates accumulatively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Wonder-as-elusive-energy premise synthesizes spiritual failure into fresh CR, transforming blackout trope through Elara's routine with inevitable hindsight payoff.</comment>
