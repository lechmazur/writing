<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's fearlessness rooted in exhaustion and losses drives concrete micro-choices like singing the researched joyful memory; soldier's shame yields to laughter via her pursuit. Contradictory ache/hope embodied in chest wound and tired hope. Final endurance earned with visible ongoing cost, no unmotivated epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from setup (tooth exam) to soldier's emergence, harp play, smile, laughter/dispersal as Charged Poise RR with her felt ache as cost. Anchors (Mira at Echo Gorge, sunrise) by para 1. Single scene holds; closure image of warming tooth/another spirit reconfigures ongoing stake legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gorge's acoustics amplify unfinished frequencies, constraining harp's distorted notes to reach spirits; crocodile tooth as tool tunes for spectral access. Final warming tooth charges reprise. Sensory selectivity (amber threads, mist, wobbly notes splitting into cascade) POV-filtered via Mira's priorities, mirrors internal luminous ache.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrate laughter for release) signaled early, tightens via researched song triggering soldier's smile/laughter under Accumulative lens. Her agency in playing/singing forecloses his shame path with her ache as felt cost. One deepening suffices; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of joy in parting emerges via particulars: soldier's milk-nose laugh memory reweights shame; final "sacred absurdity" image answers without stating. No moralizing; ambiguity in her unhealed ache invites reflection. Recurs organically, not token.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (grief-water-stone, luminous ache); diction/rhythm modulates from hushed to cascading notes. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: lines layer setting/character/action (e.g., "notes emerged broken... cascade of sound that filled the space with something like music made of tears"). Varied rhythm, no loops; figurative density purposeful in lyric mode but borders overwrites in climax play para (−0.4). Zero scaffold, strong verbs propel to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: soul collector uses misaligned harp/tooth for laughter-release transforms ghost tropes via gorge acoustics and researched joy-moments. Risky lyric texture heightens stakes; "pursued the art of helping souls laugh" inflects inevitably from setup. No derivatives.</comment>
