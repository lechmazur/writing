<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Steadfast pacifist trait compels non-violent stitching climax, earning integration of shadow with embodied gravitational lift as visible cost; contradictory grief/joy impulses act in scene without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through density build to on-page RR closure; final thread pull and dimension bloom reconfigure light/shadow with conceptual cost of preserved grief released, anchored early without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recycled ship's salvaged details (patchwork hull, gravity pools, dust) and photos constrain stitching choice; recurring shimmer/vial charge final image, with sensory bias reflecting pacifist priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of shadow integration signaled early, deepens via realization to stitching agency under accumulative lens; gravitational rise forecloses grief path with felt cost at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of compassion stitching fragmented light emerges from particulars like tear/shimmer/web; final blooming image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical single-POV voice stable with perceptual signature (light patterns, weightless joy); rhythmic modulation heightens texture under pressure, elisions taught early and legible at charged poise close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; purposeful metaphors (blooming dimension, stitched web) cohere without muddle or loops, though minor purple in "void that was not void" nudges from peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of AI pacifist, tear-compassion, photo-stitching transforms post-human tropes; risk-taking lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes to inevitable dimension open without gimmick.</comment>
