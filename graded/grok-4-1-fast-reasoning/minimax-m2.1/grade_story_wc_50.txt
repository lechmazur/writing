<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in peripheral focus and reflective practice; micro-choices like using mirrors reveal values under pressure. Minor slip: lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, with realization feeling smoothly competent rather than conflicted. Final satisfaction earned but without deep embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation layers build density to Conceptual Repricing closure where timer shifts from broken to waiting vessel ("pause deliberate, a sentence without a period"). Orientation anchored early; cost legible in seasons-long repair ("time measured not in hours but in seasons"). No slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marble cavern's acoustic purity and light constrain choices via mirrors and echoes; peripheral vision sharpens under its demands. Wounded season's lull integrates causally, slowing decay to enable study. Final image charges environment as space "between wonder and understanding."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest/repair echoes via timer) signaled early; escalation via deepening realization that repair redirects purpose, narrowing from function to wonder storage. Agency in reflective method; cost felt in patient integration. Minor abstractness in stakes until late pivot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder integrated into reason emerges organically via timer as "vessel for wonder"; final image reweights premise without moralizing ("found not a solution but a proper question"). Subtext in echoes and reflection layers complexity. Resonant non-literal close.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in peripheral noticing ("movement in doorways she was not looking at"); lyrical diction and rhythm modulate insight build. No head-hopping; voice reflects locksmith's reflective mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm; metaphors like "sediment forming stone" integrate without muddle. Minor figurative density in opening ("wounded season settled into its lull") risks overwrite but supports accumulative texture. Propulsion clear to closure; no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith as "reflective practitioner" transforming timer trope into echo-harvester; poetic frame risks gimmick but commits fully, heightening stakes via peripheral insight. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from cavern's resonance.</comment>
