<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Solid interiority rooted in dye master's patient observation, embodied in "new heart beating with unfamiliar rhythm" and culminating in earned transformation via donor inheritance. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for 9+ test, but micro-choices like tilting the wing reveal values under reflective pressure. Flaws balanced without hedging; realization forecloses prior uncertainty with felt expansion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wing observation to layered realizations (grandmother, donor), delivering Conceptual Repricing closure in final lift where colors cascade on hands, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of inherited receptivity. Orientation anchored early in tea house/heart transplant. No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint of iridescence shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring wing and micro-setting (sun trails on membrane) constrain revelation and charge closure image; floating tea house's suspension mirrors liminal stakes. Sensory details selective through dye-master bias (colors shifting "cobalt and violet"). Environment evolves with light, guiding quiet action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why stories magnetize) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative deepening: wing tilt narrows to receiver-transformation insight, foreclosing passive recovery with new purpose cost. Agency in sustained attention/tilting; one tightening sufficient, cost legible in heart's expansion. No abstract stakes; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of receptive transformation emerges organically from wing/heart/dye particulars, final image offering non-literal resonant answer (legacy illuminating hands) without moralizing. Subtext in iridescence's caution-promise reweights prior material; earned wisdom avoids platitudes. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: dye-master lens on light/color ("iridescent caution written in every shifting hue"). Lyrical rhythm modulates intensity, compression purposeful and taught early; diction biased/selective. No head-hopping or leaks; voice coherent under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (e.g., "light transformed the membrane into something alive"), varied rhythm passes read-aloud. Minor overwriting in metaphors but coherent/voice-motivated; no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks dulling closure. Zero artifacts in peak realization beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dye mastery, heart transplant, story-magnetism via wing's iridescence transforms reflective trope organically. Risk in quiet Accumulative closure heightens stakes without gimmickry; non-obvious angle on legacy/receptivity feels inevitable. Bold perceptual specificity anchors universals.</comment>
