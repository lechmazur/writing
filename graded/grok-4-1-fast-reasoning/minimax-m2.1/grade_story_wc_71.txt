<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character defined sharply through noticing displacements like tilted photos and handprint warmth, rooting motivation in grandmother's teaching; interiority concrete and embodied without therapy-speak; earned stasis in accepting inheritance via shard's warmth shows micro-choices under pressure, though contradictory impulses act more implicitly than simultaneously in pivotal cataloging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of evidences building to on-page CR closure ("She is not alone here, and she never was"); orientation anchors who/where/when by para 2 (Mira at grandmother's bay house, violet hour); single scene coherent, cost legible in recognition's "quiet blaze" reweighting isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting vivid and selective (salt-worn clapboard, orris scent, sea lavender) filters through Mira's bias, constraining choices via house's "subtle radiations"; recurring shard as micro-setting charges final image, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism; spatial choreography clean in room progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand alive houses) signaled para 3, escalates accumulatively via deepening evidences (cup residue knowing grandmother sat recently) narrowing to CR; agency in attention forecloses doubt with felt cost of perpetual presence; one tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory-made-alive emerges organically from displaced objects and shard's reprise, reweighting premise in final image without statement; subtext in "hush of understanding" invites ambiguity (haunting as ordinary inheritance); resonant non-literal answer to central question via "quiet blaze of recognition."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable with perceptual signature (attuned to "spaces between things"); voice texture distinct in rhythmic lyricism ("violet hour," "daydreaming streetlights") modulating to intensity at closure; purposeful compression legible, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (sentences layer senses/action like "faint stickiness of residue" advancing knowledge); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops though "hush" recurs purposefully; minor overwrought figuration ("streetlights daydream") contained, clarity intact at shard-warming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of subtle haunting as accumulated noticing/memory, transformed via orris shard inheritance; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes of realization without gimmick; final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
