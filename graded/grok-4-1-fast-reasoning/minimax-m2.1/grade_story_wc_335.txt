<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied traits like walking backwards to create space and combative tenderness compel choices; children's shift from terror to curiosity earned via micro-gestures culminates in boy's reach, satisfying 9+ test without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in final gesture ("fragile bud of resilience"); cost legible in prior terror and fragile nod; orientation anchored early, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shadow in glass constrains Maren's teaching of reversibility and charges planned final reveal; dust motes, swing, tea leaves selective and POV-biased; satisfies 9+ via object shaping closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of quiet resilience mentorship tightens accumulatively from arrival terror to tea gesture reversal; Maren's agency in unflinching gaze and leaf-tracing forecloses rejection path with felt fragility cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Reversible exile theme emerges organically via tea geometry and shadow, answered non-literally in "bud pushing through frozen soil"; resonant without moralizing, reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (geometry, reversals, spatial poetry) stable in Maren's limited POV; minimal dialogue ("Tea") natural and goal-driven; rhythmic control peaks in final unwind image.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric metaphors (dust motes as "slow planets") taught early; minor overwriting in shadow descriptions doesn't dull closure; varied rhythm propels to crisp final nod.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tea-leaf geometry mentorship and reversible shadows transforms exile trope; backward walking and combative tenderness feel inevitable, risking poetic density that heightens stakes.</comment>
