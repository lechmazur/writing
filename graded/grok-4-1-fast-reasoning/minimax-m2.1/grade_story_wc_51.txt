<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied (pressures as "stone in the stomach"); endurance of calcification earned by prior weaving causality, with visible cost in flesh-to-stone transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of burdens/patterns tightens to Charged Poise closure in "added the final thread... another layer of silence settle," reconfiguring her from weaver to pattern with permanence cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Bronze grotto fissures/starlight and burden pool constrain orientation/work; shingled hush layers charge final silence/song image, sensory hierarchy POV-specific (silence as "pressurable against her skin").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weave burdens for release/transformation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via calcification creep and final thread; agency in non-resistance forecloses independent path, cost felt in "flesh slowly to something more permanent."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of shared sorrow as infinite pattern emerges organically; final whalebone song reweights premise of solitary vs. woven burden without moralizing, resonant via calcification image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with fractal/perceptual signature ("patterns that repeated inward toward infinity"); rhythmic modulation builds to reverie closure, no elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., "shingled hush... layer upon layer" purposeful accumulation); no loops/artifacts, propulsion aligns with textural intensification to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh fractal-burden premise synthesized with grotto logic; risk in lyric transformation heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight via early pattern-teaching to calcification payoff.</comment>
