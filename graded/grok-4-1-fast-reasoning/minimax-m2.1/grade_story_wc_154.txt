<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elira's shrewd innocence enables the translation turn, with embodied emotion (throat catching) and micro-choice (pressing palm to cast) earning the final renunciation; Fatima's touch crystallizes shared witness without stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to CR closure in final palm-press image, reweighting trauma with conceptual cost of persistent ache; orientation anchored early, one tightening via cast decryption suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brain coral charges final image, paralleling cast as living architecture from damage; mist-clad atrium's fountains and fog selectively mirror recovery, constraining reflective choices without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of witnessing via translation tightens through Wolof decryption, narrowing to graft meaning with felt cost (shared grief via touch and weeping); agency in decryption forecloses silence, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of remaking wounds emerges via coral-cast parallel, final image offering resonant CR without moralizing; subtext in child's etchings invites complexity of recoverable meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (translator's eye for subtleties) modulates rhythm under anesthetic haze; stable close-3rd POV, purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image-charged sentences; figurative language (lotus-hearted ache) coherent and pattern-taught, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of translator decoding child's cast as trauma graft, transforming recovery tropes via coral motif; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
