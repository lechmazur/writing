<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's denial of bloodlines conflicts with her magnetized pull to the crank handle, embodied in trembling recognition; final endurance of truth forecloses escape with felt identity cost. Interiority concrete via sensory memory cues. Minor slip: archetypal heir trope slightly genericizes flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from entry to voice; CR closure reweights dynasty premise ("ended fifty years before") with conceptual cost in recognition. Single scene fits defaults; orientation anchored early at gates. Truncation mid-sentence dulls closure legibility, costing -0.8 under non-closure cap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sepia room and gramophone constrain choices (locked sacredness yields, handle magnetizes); golden shadows recur to charge final coalescence image. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (dust-sweet air evokes ghosts). Micro-setting (crank) alters tactics perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confront legacy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via crank turn narrowing denial options; agency in winding forces revelation trade-off. Cost legible in intuition bridge foreclosing accident-of-history belief. One tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hidden bloodline truths emerges organically from crank activation to voice; final CR offers non-literal reweighting ("bridge of intuition") without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like preserved room mirroring suspended grief. Lingers via ambiguity of choice's echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (light as memory/ghosts); rhythmic modulation builds intensity (short sentences at crank yield). Voice texture character-specific, biased to scholarly decay. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "wisteria had claimed... weaving chaos through bones of order" multisensory advance); varied rhythm, no loops. Minor overwrite in gold/amber repetition, but pattern-taught pays off at shadows coalescing. Clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gramophone voicing pre-recording era via standing waves transforms haunted house trope ingeniously; risk-taking in textural supernatural synthesis feels inevitable. Fresh angle on legacy via resonant frequency. Bold lyric closure heightens stakes.</comment>
