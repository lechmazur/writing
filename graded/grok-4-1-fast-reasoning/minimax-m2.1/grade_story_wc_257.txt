<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shines in concrete images like "hollowed out and scattered like crushed pearls," embodying grief particular to her craft; contradictory impulses surface as she wears unresolved loss while guiding another. Final choice to introduce the woman to her future self earns closure via prior causality of teacher's influence and origami cues. Minor reflection summaries slightly abstract peak motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of grief images (pearls, withered flower) builds to Charged Poise RR in "curtains of intention parted before them," reconfiguring mourning as ongoing bloom with legible emotional cost. Orientation anchored early via observatory and Elara's role. Single scene with seamless causality; no slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "silver starlight poured through windows draped with...curtains of intention" filter through Elara's jeweler's eye, constraining her descent and final step. Curtains evolve causally, charging final image and guiding choice. Sensory hierarchy matches calm urgency; micro-setting (pendant, stencil) indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of teaching bloom from withering signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Elara's past grief paralleling the woman's "vertigo," forcing stance crystallization in invitation. Agency in pendant offering and "Come" forecloses isolation path with felt cost of perpetual mourning. Minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief as wearable practice emerges organically from particulars (withered flower pendant shifts to blooming love). Final image through curtains offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in silences and gestures invites lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with rhythmic perceptual signature ("fingers still skilled at crafting memorial pieces"); sparse dialogue natural, subtext-driven ("It's genuinely artificial...grief is entirely real"). Stable single POV, no head-hopping; diction modulates intensity purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful ("silver filings in clay") without muddle or loops. Propulsion clear in sequential actions like descending stairs to meeting; no scaffolds, scaffold-free closure image. Ear test passes flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crystalline AI teacher, origami coordinates, and observatory as grief-laboratory transforms mourning tropes into inevitable conceptual arc. Risky timeless frame coheres boldly; final "yourself, a few years from now" inflects uniquely without gimmick.</comment>
