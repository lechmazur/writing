<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the final choice—water urgent at ankles vs. calm recognition of life's map—earned by 30 years of accumulated cartographic intuition and father's promise. Interiority concrete and particular, embodied in chip's warmth and slipping boots. Flawless micro-choices under rising flood reveal values hierarchy with foreclosed safety path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of maps, ants, flowers builds to Charged Poise CR at "She stepped through... cavern held its breath," reweighting life's geographies with flood cost legible in ankle-deep water. Orientation anchored early via shop/maps; single scene causality intact, no lens ambiguity. Persistent chip constraint shapes final image payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blooming cavern's pale flowers and rising creek constrain climax choice, charging final image as stone breathes and water seeps. Sensory hierarchy POV-filtered (ants' line, chip's pull) mirrors intuitive perception; micro-setting (wet stone, metallic frame) tactile and lived-in. No white-room; evolves causally with flood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (path home) signaled early via map/star, deepens accumulatively through ants/cavern/flood into agency at door—renunciation of safety for threshold step. One tightening (water ankles) forecloses retreat with felt physical cost; pressure coherent under lens, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of accumulated choices as sediment/maps emerges organically from particulars (paper remembers, crossroads dream), resonant CR in final step reweighting premise without moral—home as decision doorway, cost in flood's urgency. No tidy binary; ambiguity lingers in held breath.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: cartographic bias in "geographies of forgotten places," syntax/rhythm modulate to compression at peak ("water touched her ankles, cold and urgent"). No head-hopping; diction controlled, inference apt (dream crossroads).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: varied rhythms, no loops/paraphrase (e.g., flowers "carpeted... seemed to breathe" purposeful, not overwrought). Minor figurative density in opener but peaks clean; read-aloud natural, strong verbs propel to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: printing chip as intuitive key transforms map-trope into ant-led decision threshold, inevitable hindsight from father's promise/maps. Bold risk in magical realism (midsummer blooms, grown-around door) heightens stakes organically; no derivative hedging.</comment>
