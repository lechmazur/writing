<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—continues weaving amid eruption despite unreliable memories—and final endurance earned by prior causality, with cost of indistinguishable recollections settling "into her bones." Interiority concrete and particular, embodied in steady hands against warping walls; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from weaving to glowing threads and eruption hum, culminating in CR closure—"she would never fully distinguish"—with conceptual cost of overwritten self legible in final image of waiting among threads. Orientation anchored early (architect in gallery tonight); no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Optical illusions constrain choices (recalibrating around threads) and charge final image (resolve into "perfect clarity" of possible arrangements); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (lagging mirrors reflect her altered memories). Micro-setting of sinew thread as recurring object evolves tactilely, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under Accumulative lens, dominant stake (weave dream amid memory unreliability) escalates via cadence shift at eruption—"hum... space between atoms"—forcing endurance with felt cost (dreams pressing "with gentle insistence"); agency in not stopping reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of perception's seams emerges organically from weaving and illusions, final image offering resonant CR—"never fully distinguish between the memories she had made and the ones she had been made of"—reweighting rational enchantment without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (illusions as "ghostly overlays"); rhythmic control modulates intensity, compressing under eruption stress while holding texture; purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion—e.g., "sinew thread sang slightly... faint trails of phosphorescence"—varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; figurative language pattern-taught (fractured light, breathing walls) without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of illusionist architect with sinew thread transforms perception tropes; "texture of connection" turn grows inevitably from particulars, bold lyric risk heightens stakes via memory bleed without gimmickry.</comment>
