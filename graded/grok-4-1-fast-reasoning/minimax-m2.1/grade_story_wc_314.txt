<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentimental trait compellingly shown via reverent bird-watching against cold scientist facade, earning mask-shattering weep at climax; embodied tears with heart-mind merge reveal contradictory impulses acting in final beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via observations to CR closure ("she had been the crystal all along"); orientation anchored early, cost legible in shattered mask and unexpected crystal transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaleidoscopic waterfall's shifting colors and orchard mist constrain crystal ritual, charging final pulsing light image; sensory selection (rainbow light on ice) mirrors internal thaw purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (balance for transformation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through starling patterns narrowing to intuition triumph; agency in raising crystal/flame forecloses logic-only path with epiphanic cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Logic-intuition harmony emerges implicitly from bird-map realization and crystal bridge, reweighting premise in final image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in self-as-crystal avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with wonder-biased perceptual signature (starlings as "letter from a beloved friend"); rhythmic modulation builds to closure without elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overdense figurative language (e.g., every-sentence metaphors in climax) and repetitive "between X and Y" stems create template cadence, dulling propulsion; paraphrase loops on wonder/knowledge obscure peak density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh alchemy reframe as heart-world conversation via starling choreography and living crystal transforms trope organically; risk-taking in lyric epiphany heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
