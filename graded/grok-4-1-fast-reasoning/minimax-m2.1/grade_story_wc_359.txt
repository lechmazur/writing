<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Synesthetic interiority vividly embodied in perceptions like "Middle C erupted... as violet dawn," rooting motivation to certify wonder; micro-choices like placing the sheet and ringing the bell reveal values under pressure. Lacks on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, keeping it from exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from waiting hush to symphonic presence, with CR closure in "Yara's bell finally rang... every color at once," reweighting wonder as essential; cost legible in "tears freeze upon her cheeks." Orientation anchored early; lens holds cleanly to end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ice cavern as "frozen lung" and aurora ribbons constrain and charge choices, with walls becoming "each crystal... a bell itself" in climax; sensory hierarchy via synesthesia selective and purposeful. Environment shapes final cathedral of light image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to certify wonder tightens accumulatively as tones spiral and sheet hovers, narrowing to bell-ring with felt cost in frozen tears; agency in unfettering perceptions forces stance crystallization. One deepening suffices, but lacks sharper trade-off foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's essentiality emerges organically from particulars like amber notes pulsing and hush singing; final aurora blaze offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Complexity in patient ages' conjunction lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in color-sound fusions like "white-gold filament"; rhythmic prose modulates from hush to blaze. No head-hopping or elision issues; diction biased to synesthetic urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "waiting" pattern taught early, paying off in unfettering; varied rhythm flows read-aloud, no loops or muddled metaphors in peak bell-ring. Figurative coherence via synesthesia avoids overwriting penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia certifying wonder transforms mythic tropes into tactile lyric arc; risk in Accumulative CR heightens stakes via ice-to-light crescendo. Inevitable hindsight from prism-bell premise.</comment>
