<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Quiet determination embodied in hands and labor compels higher-stakes choices like mine descents; interiority concrete via patient mapping. Minor weakness: internal conflict summarized rather than dramatized in pivotal discovery moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through deepening labor density to Charged Poise closure in final forge image; cost legible in "refused to stop working." Structure fits single reflective shard; orientation anchored early in planetary ruin.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating arches and deep roots constrain choices via indifference and untapped resources; sensory selection (humming lattice, pale stems) mirrors internal resilience. Micro-setting of forge/ash charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of coaxing life from ruin signaled early, escalates accumulatively via root discovery tightening options; cost felt in exhausting solitude. Quiet endurance forecloses giving-up path without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of persistence over providence emerges via blossoms contradicting ash; final image reconfigures rubble-to-resilience without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in Cael's humming.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature in tactile forge/mine details; rhythmic modulation builds quiet intensity. No dialogue; voice distinct in textured, non-tourist planetary filter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors coherent (e.g., blackened fingers). Minor scaffold in reflective paraphrase ("stubborn, unremarkable insistence") nudges down but doesn't touch closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of downward trees and silk lattice transforms blight trope; risk in quiet arc heightens defiance stakes. Inevitable hindsight from meek hands shaping world.</comment>
