<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in hedge maze expertise compel the final drawing with embodied emotion; contradictory impulses in understanding fading show in her trembling alignment with grandmother's future self. Final renunciation of passive observation earns closure choice via prior realizations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of discoveries tightening to CR closure: Elara's vision through halo fragment reconfigures time's texture with conceptual cost of completing the circuit, on-page in drawing amid humming fragment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like vines "walk[ing] across rusted irrigation channels" and root-cellar light constrain paths and charge final image of leaning bridges; POV-biased sensory hierarchy (growth/surrender) mirrors stakes perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to halt photo disintegration escalates accumulatively via deepening realizations (photos showing future), forcing agency in fragment use; one tightening narrows to designing maze, with felt cost in foreclosed temporal boundaries.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of time's texture emerges organically from garden geometry and photo shifts; final image of drawing with humming fragment offers resonant CR answer, reweighting prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in botanical-temporal diction (e.g., "origami made of hours"); rhythmic control modulates from reverie to charged poise without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied syntax; purposeful garden/time metaphors cohere without muddle, though minor figurative density in realizations slightly slows peak without obscuring humming closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal horticulture transforms tropes via hyperbolic geometry and retrocognitive photos; risk in CR closure via "texture of time" feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
