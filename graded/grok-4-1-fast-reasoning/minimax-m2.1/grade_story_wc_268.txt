<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Threnody's motivation to unmask the pretender is clear and consistent, rooted in her ageless vigil, but lacks on-page contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; the smile at closure earns endurance without deeper internal conflict shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of annotations building to Charged Poise closure in the constellation pause and smile; cost of endless vigil felt in "returned to her endless work," legible without causal break; orientation anchored early in temple library details.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library's "graceful collapse" and moss-traced floors vividly constrain her whisper-movements and ink work, charging final image of sleeping books; sensory details (dust motes, breathing building) selectively mirror patience without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unmasking pretender tightens accumulatively via generational annotations toward scholar's birth; agency in patient inscribing forecloses violent paths with conceptual cost of time, legible in air shift and smile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of patient truth's unstoppable flow emerges organically from rune pattern and ink's biological reveal, resonating in final "quiet, unstoppable power" without moralizing; reweights stolen identity via particulars like drift rune.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable with perceptual signature in anthropomorphic library ("conversational" ruins, breathing rhythm); rhythmic prose modulates elegantly, diction biased toward timeless dignity without withholding or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid, purposeful metaphors (e.g., "stars first learned their dance") propel accumulatively, but minor overwriting in descriptive runs slightly dulls propulsion before constellation shift; no loops, strong read-aloud rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of diminutive titan as ink-trap architect transforms pretender trope via biological rune mechanics; risk in non-violent, centuries-spanning sunder feels inevitable, heightened by library's organic decay.</comment>
