<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density from arrow tip discovery to final clear bell image; CR closure lands decisively in "the workshop's entire engine room began to hum," reweighting isolation with future certainty at undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Kaleidoscope and arrow tip as recurring micro-settings constrain choices and charge final image; acid sea and gears tactilely pressure floating existence through POV's curious geometries.</comment>
