<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Archivist's motivation to compile fragments drives consistent micro-choices like salvaging the valve and inducing visions; interiority concrete via embodied visions tying objects to origins. Final realization of valve's purpose earns change with felt cost of past silence. Minor backstory summary slightly abstracts struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragment density builds to valve vision as CR, reweighting exile's absence with harbor's promise; cost legible in "after the silence of separation." Orientation anchored in opening harbor scene; single continuous window fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivory harbor after rain vividly sensory (salt crystals, wet cobblestones, mist), mirroring internal gathering; recurring harbor view charges closure image of gleaming stones. Constrains via boats arriving, waiting emptiness. POV-filtered through archivist's cataloging bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring meaning post-exile signaled early, escalates accumulatively via Sera's fragments tightening to valve vision, narrowing from reactive to proactive purpose. Agency in handling objects forecloses passive waiting; cost felt in years of compulsion. Quiet but coherent pressure fits lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reassembling meaning from absence emerges via fragments/visions, resonant in final valve closure without moralizing; reweights exile as space for gathering. Subtext in "bridge between what was lost and what might be remembered" lingers organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in object-triggered visions; rhythmic diction modulates from misty observation to dawning intensity. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven; no head-hopping, elisions purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm; purposeful metaphors (e.g., "echo long after the rain had dried") integrate without muddle. No loops/artifacts; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visionary relic-reader post-exile transforms fragment tropes into textured drive; valve's evolution from corroded fitting to "promise" feels inevitable. Bold lyric accumulative risk heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
