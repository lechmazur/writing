<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's exhaustion embodies contradiction (trembling hands, double vision) driving micro-choices like bare feet on causeway; earned sleep renunciation forecloses endless search with felt physical cost. Stranger pressures via recognition and direct exchange. Voice-specific perception as painter ties to stakes without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of rain trails, mist-emerging island, unearthed pillars build to Charged Poise closure where telescope snaps horizon into focus, reconfiguring search with legible exhaustion cost in "finally let go." Orientation anchored by ~100 words; single scene tightens meaningfully at pavilion exchange.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tidal flats' black stone causeway and low-tide access constrain Mira's path, charging final pillar-lean image; sensory hierarchy (rain silver threads, cold brooch) reflects painterly bias under fatigue. Post-wars world rules consistent via action (rain fluency), no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (acquire tool to end insomnia-fueled search) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via trail-following fatigue to exchange trade-off, narrowing options with bodily cost legible in trembling hands; agency in direct barter under stranger pressure, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of meaning-threshed-from-survival emerges via exchange currencies (brooch for telescope) and convergence image, reweighting scarcity without moralizing; final awe answers search via non-literal sleep, resonant with prior exhaustion particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature (colors unnamed, rain as language) modulates with fatigue; dialogue sparse, subtextual ("You have something I need"), distinct voices (stranger's wry directness vs. Mira's silence); no head-hopping, rhythmic control heightens closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("rain trails down eastern ridge"); varied syntax/paragraphs breathe with awe escalation, no loops or filter stacks; metaphors consistent (water miracles, silver threads) without muddle in peak exchange beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-wars rain-navigation by painter threshing "sleepless colors" into telescope convergence; risk in lyric post-apoc tone transforms tropes organically, no derivative templates.</comment>
