<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in "tremor of certainty" as "second heartbeat" drives embodied micro-choices like palm-pressing and reciting; interiority concrete via cloud-shadow lens. Earned reconfiguration at colonnade heart from trembling to "settled knowledge." Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, tilting toward epiphanic summary in "understood the method... perceptual."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: column-by-column density builds to Charged Poise closure at heart with tears and "beauty... freely given." Orientation anchored early in "cobalt atrium... frozen lake." Cost legible in final "boundaries... dissolved" reconfiguration; constraint of columns shapes perceptual tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: "hum intensified, resonating through her bones"; POV-biased via "cloud shadows she had spent her life photographing." Colonnade constrains progression, charges final lake reflection mirroring internal shift. No generic placeholders; details evolve causally with her advance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cross sacred boundaries) signaled early post-ban; Accumulative escalation via deepening realization "boundaries... in the mind first," narrowing via recitation. Agency in perceptual dissolution forecloses prohibition path. Subtle pressure lacks visceral external test, but cost felt in tears at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of perceptual boundaries dissolving via art emerges organically from paraphrase and recitation beats; final "new poem" offers resonant CR reweighting "what was sacred... meant to be crossed." No moralizing; ambiguity in "forces no one could explain" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in shifting light/shadow diction; rhythmic modulation builds lyric intensity to "lantern-moth hush." Purposeful compression in column advances teaches pattern, legible at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines like "hum... align the soul" advance atmosphere and stakes. Rhythmic variety in short "She stopped" amid lyric swells. Minor figurative density ("fractured glass... silver water") in opening risks overwrite but teaches voice pattern without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh perceptual-boundary premise transformed via poetry-as-method in humming quartz world; "cloud-shadow poet" inflects familiar forbidden-space trope organically. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
