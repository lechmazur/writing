<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve wonder via tuning is rooted and intensifies through micro-choices like turning the mobile; Juniper's nod provides relational pressure confirming fulfillment. Interiority concrete and embodied in seasonal silence and shoulder-settling approval. Minor slip: internal conflict more declarative than simultaneously acted, but closure endurance feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tuning to Juniper's arrival and sculpture's movement, culminating in Charged Poise CR where silence becomes "full of sound" with conceptual cost of human smallness. Orientation anchored early in bluff/garden. One tightening via kinetic sigh suffices; final image ("fragment held its color") proves legible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Whispering Bluff, wind, and iceberg constrain choices via air/light pressures on sculpture, charging final glistening image. Sensory details (crystalline frequencies, amber fragments) selective through Elara's tuner bias, integrated into action. Environment mirrors internal recognition without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder/truth via sculpture) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through finishing, Juniper's nod, and movement narrowing to earned stasis in silence. Agency in tuning/turning; felt cost in seasonal mute endurance legible at closure. No major slips touching peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth as convergence emerges organically from sculpture's mechanics, seasonal silence, and final symphony image reweighting silence as fullness without moralizing. Particulars like iceberg depth shift meaning at end; invites reflection on non-verbal communication with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature in sonic/tactile noticing (frequencies, pressures); rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive to charged poise. Juniper nod carries subtext; no dialogue to judge, but mute interactions natural. Voice distinct, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm suiting lyric build; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors despite figurative density—pattern taught early as tuner's idiom. Minor register elevation purposeful; closure image clear, varied paragraphing breathes with scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-Quieting world, kinetic truth-symphonies, and ancient ice transforms silence trope via specific mechanics/ice color stake. Risky lyric poise heightens resonance without gimmick; inevitable hindsight from opening bluff whispers to endless sky conversation.</comment>
