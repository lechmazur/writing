<comment>Contradictory impulses act concretely when Marcus pockets the bolt instead of reporting it, earning the final renunciation of pure safety with embodied cost in his tingling nerves and brother's echoed silence; voice-specific noticing (regenerated sensitivity to clink) reveals flaws under pressure. Minor diagnostic phrasing in final realization prevents perfection.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from bolt to dust trail to thawing heart CR, reweighting silence with conceptual cost legible in "unpardonable silence was not what he had failed to say but what he had chosen to believe"; orientation anchors early in fortress entrance and winter nerves; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Snow-thrown light on oxidized bolt and bronze dust trail constrain noticing and choice to follow upward, charging final snowflake image; body-as-microsetting (nerve hum distinguishing pain/hope) mirrors internal thaw; sensory hierarchy POV-specific to sensitized silence.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant internal stake (safety vs. brother's dangerous path) signaled early in chosen voiceless job, deepens accumulatively via bolt/dust discovery narrowing to remain/follow, crystallizing stance with felt cost of foreclosed reporting; agency in pocketing alters tactics under lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Silence-as-chosen-belief theme emerges organically from choir backstory, bolt evidence of passage, and final safety-accomplice realization, resonating via snow symphony image without direct statement; complexity in frostbitten hope avoids tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (music-breath silences, nerve fire/tingle) modulates rhythmically under rising density; syntax reflects thawing mind, e.g., unresolved chord metaphor ties voice to stakes; purposeful compression legible throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>High density with lines doubling image/advance (bolt "green with oxidation yet somehow bright" propels curiosity); varied rhythm reads aloud as patient crescendo to final image; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures—music metaphors consistent/voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Silent-choir bellhop synthesizing regret/music/regeneration into frostbitten hope feels inevitable via bolt/music-dust link; transforms safety trope through seraphic mundanity of evidence over vision; risks lyric CR payoff heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
