<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's quiet determination and contradiction with Council drive micro-choices like blowing the whistle, embodied in palm tremor and reed handling. Interiority particular via pattern obsession and mentor loss. Final agency earned by prior persistence; no safety-hedging in blind defiance of Priestesses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds to whistle cadence shift and glow RR (Charged Poise), reweighting patterns with cost of turtle awakening. Orientation anchored early (Mira mapping spirals). Closure cost legible in "shells began to warm... shifting in their ancient sleep."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Turtle shells constrain choices (kneeling at intersection, palm-reading hum) and charge final glow image. Sensory hierarchy via cartographer bias (bioluminescence fade, cracks). Sunwashed dread filters details purposefully, evolving with glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expedition truth via watchers' gaze) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through pattern sequence to whistle blow narrowing options. Agency in whistle forces reconfiguration; felt cost in shell shift forecloses stasis. Escalation coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of hidden patterns vs. forgetting emerges via spiral question answered in glow, reweighting Council denial without moralizing. Final image resonates as non-literal reply to watchers' vigil. Complexity in ambiguous turtle dream/dying.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (pattern frequencies, shell hums). Rhythmic modulation builds to reedy whistle thinness. Voice texture distinct in syntax like "sun that poured through the cloudless sky like something dying."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("poured like something dying") purposeful for dread but risks muddle. No loops; clean causality in final glow beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Turtle-shell city and pattern languages synthesize fresh premise organically; whistle reprise transforms superstition into activation. Risk in watchers' ambiguity heightens stakes without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from ink-dot sequence.</comment>
