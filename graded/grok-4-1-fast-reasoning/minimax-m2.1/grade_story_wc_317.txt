<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between commercial pressure and seed-taught patience act in design shifts; final endurance of ambiguity earned via patient watching, with cost to predictable success shown in "building toward possibility spaces."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via insight density; CR closure lands in "purpose had already been served," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of unmanufactured innovation, oriented clearly from porch/package opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brook's flow constrains planting ("constant flow provided moisture") and charges final image as "patient insistence" mirroring patience; selective sensory details like "moonlight fracture" filter through puzzle-minded POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of innovation vs. pressure deepens accumulatively through seed watching into design changes; agency in "attentive presence" forecloses rushed optimization with felt cost to customer satisfaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of nurturing over rushing emerges via seed's stillness shifting orthogonal designs; resonant CR in final hush reweights premise without moral, inviting ambiguity on commercial viability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("reality was merely one puzzle among many") biases noticing toward mysteries; stable close third modulates rhythm with emotional intensity, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "something so massive and pungent emerging from something so small"; varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts, purposeful figures like "origami nightmares" enhance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corpse flower irony and orthogonal escape rooms transforms innovation trope; risk in patient ambiguity heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via seed's teacher role.</comment>
