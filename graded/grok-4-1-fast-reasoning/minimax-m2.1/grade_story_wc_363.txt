<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in grief; contradictory impulses (protecting self vs. weaving message) culminate in earned sacrificial choice. Final unraveling moment reveals hierarchy of values with embodied trembling heart and steady hands. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of weaving images building to Conceptual Repricing closure; her transformation into the bead sends the message with undeniable existential cost. Orientation anchored early in orchard; single scene coherent. No causality breaks; pattern taught pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard, bamboo, and loom constrain choices (orchard watches, bamboo patient) and charge final image of empty humming loom. Sensory hush and raveling silence selective through POV urgency. Micro-setting (workbench ritual) mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete message) signaled early; accumulation deepens via realization of self-sacrifice, narrowing options under Textural lens. Agency in unraveling forecloses existence with legible cost in transformation. One decisive tightening suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of becoming the message emerges organically from weaving particulars and grief; final image of gone bead reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance from shifting silence and puzzle edges invites ambiguity on memory's distance. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (threads remembering words, raveling silence) stable in single close-third POV; rhythm modulates from hush to acceleration. Purposeful compression taught early pays off in closure image. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; metaphors consistent (unraveling self into tapestry) without muddle or loops in peak beats. Rhythmic variety in heddles clicking with heartbeat propels to closure. Minor repetition of "raveling silence" pattern-taught, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of loom-weaving, puzzle edges, and self-sacrifice transforms grief trope into inevitable CR; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens conceptual stakes. No derivative echoes; particulars like rummage edges feel organic and irreplaceable.</comment>
