<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation and micro-choices reveal Elias's heartfelt traits through repair actions, with blindness as a balanced flaw turned strength; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the scene, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from damage assessment to repair culmination; on-page Charged Poise closure in drone's release ("It hovered for just a moment, as if thanking him") lands with felt time-cost legibility against dawn departure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Water features and mist constrain blind repair method and charge final image; selective sensory hierarchy (ripples' "language," air shift) reflects Elias's perceptual bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (timely repair) signaled early with one tightening via extensive damage; time pressure coheres accumulatively ("depot grew louder... anchor was lifting") but lacks sharper option-narrowing trade-off, muting peak agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of decoding confusion into connection emerges organically from water-light braille and drone flight; final image ("mist swallowed the hummingbird whole") offers resonant non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with distinct blind perceptual signature (light "stutter," "bend sharply"); rhythmic control modulates calm intensity purposefully, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; purposeful mist/water pattern avoids loops, but minor figurative density in repair beat ("light's fracture... gentle arcs") borders overwriting without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind artisan's water-refraction method transforms repair trope; risk in perceptual ingenuity feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
