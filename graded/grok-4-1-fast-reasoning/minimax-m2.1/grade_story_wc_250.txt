<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Guardian's interiority is concrete and particular, with backstory anchoring present choices like mirror use; contradictory impulses in patient waiting versus past grief shown embodied. Boy's stakes inferred sharply through observation. Final gaze exchange earns stasis via prior causality, no unmotivated leaps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from observation to light patterns to charged gaze; orientation anchored in first paragraph (guardian at dock post-rain). Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in final gaze and star reflection, with boy's "half-spoken secret" cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dock, canal, shutters constrain choices (light weaving via slats); rain-fading light and mirror as micro-setting charge final image. Sensory filter (light echoes, grief in stone) POV-specific, purposeful. No white-room; spatial choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (boy's despair vs. guardian's hope-teaching) signaled early, deepens accumulatively as patterns transfix him, forcing gaze turn. Agency in patient weaving narrows to relational cost in "stillwater tension." Minor abstractness in stakes declaration slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of inherited hope via light emerges organically from mirror patterns shifting to stars; final image reconfigures "darkness" premise without statement. Subtext in silence and witnessed solitude invites ambiguity. No moralizing; resonance from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable, perceptual signature (frequencies of longing, light-speaking) character-specific; rhythm modulates from calm description to tense poise. No head-hopping; purposeful compression taught early. Diction fits mute guardian's observant mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, density high with multi-job lines; minor paraphrase loops ("she had learned," "she understood") in reflective beats drag slightly (−0.4). No closure artifacts; metaphors coherent, purposeful (spirals as possibility). Propulsion strong to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dental mirror as empathy tool weaving star-patterns transforms silence trope organically. Risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes; final inheritance reveal inevitable from particulars. No derivative echoes.</comment>
