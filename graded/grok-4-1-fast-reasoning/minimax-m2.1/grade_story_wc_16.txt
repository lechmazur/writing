<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in promise to Elian compels writing despite risk, with embodied contradiction in "hands that trembled only slightly"; relational change earned as Elian arrives, foreclosing isolation with visible tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from glyphs to symphonies, delivering Charged Poise closure in shared breath rhythm; cost legible in "silence that followed was not emptiness but held-breath," with promises as persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archive shelves and glyphs constrain interpretation choice; glass ink well charges final image as "still warm from her writing," mirroring restored trust.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unsnarl prophecy tightens texturally via realization of truthful language's death, forcing reckless writing agency; cost felt in hesitation, charged by Elian's arrival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of harmonic truth emerges via unsnarling, reweighted non-literally in final "melody that had been waiting its entire life to be sung."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in linguistic metaphors like "symphonies of truth"; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual in Elian's line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels but figurative cluster in writing beat ("fugue," "cadence," "chords") risks overwrought without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Linguistic harmonics as prophecy premise fresh synthesis, risking poetic intensity for closure's emotional inevitability.</comment>
