<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of precision (documenting phenomena) and hope (following watch) act simultaneously; final sanctum entry earned via layered revelations without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build (watch reversal, future book) to charged poise CR at door opening/second letter; cost legible in "endings were merely beginnings spoken backward."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist and luminescence constrain path through aisles, watch reflection reveals door; final sanctum image charged by indentations and shadows mirroring internal search.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens accumulatively via book with "her own handwriting that she had not yet written," narrowing to midnight endurance; cost felt in infinite loop payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final "flower made of pure language" reconfigures cipher theme non-literally, reweighting time-folding premise from particulars like Möbius strip without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in dreamlike filters ("shadows that spoke in languages she almost remembered"); rhythmic control heightens revelation without head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels; minor figurative density ("folded, layered upon itself like pages") in middle beats but no loops or muddle touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cyclically reversed library/watch premise transforms confidence man trope into fresh dreamlogic synthesis; risk-taking in time-folding heightens stakes to inevitable infinite documentation.</comment>
