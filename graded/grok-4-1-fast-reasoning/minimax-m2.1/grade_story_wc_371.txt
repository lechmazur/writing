<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and particular to Elara's attentiveness to slow change, with embodied persistence in bread-breaking ritual; endurance of burden/gift earns closure without safety-hedging. Minor slip: contradictory impulses subtle rather than acting simultaneously in pivotal bread moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to Charged Poise closure in butterfly emergence lifting "something within herself," reweighting restoration with felt persistence cost; orientation anchored early in courtyard/tea house.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vines claiming beams and jasmine-wrapped bread constrain daily uncloaking choices; fountain trickle and post-bird stillness charge final butterfly image, mirroring internal revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoration vs. creeping decay signaled early, tightens accumulatively through bread's tenuous preservation to butterfly deepening; endurance forecloses neglect path with burden cost legible in final commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tenuous absolution emerges organically from bread offering and butterfly uncloaking, reweighting ordinary persistence without moralizing; final image answers sacred-in-ordinary question via charged reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature of "creeping normality"; rhythmic syntax modulates from descriptive calm to charged lift in butterfly wings drying "patient as all true transformations."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (breaking bread "offering some to the soil") with propulsion; no loops, varied rhythm passes ear test, though minor "slow" recurrences taught thematically without artifact drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guerrilla gardening as sacred ritual in decaying palace transforms neglect tropes; butterfly emergence as uncloaking risks lyric boldness, heightening stakes inevitably from prior particulars.</comment>
