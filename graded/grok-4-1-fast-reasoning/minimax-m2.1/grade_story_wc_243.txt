<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied fear of "looking too closely would diminish the image," resolved through micro-choice of opening and studying the locket, earning the final acceptance with visible cost of embracing temporariness; contradictory impulses act on-page without therapy-speak. Single-POV voice coherent and particular. Final renunciation of freezing moments forecloses a path, compelled by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sensory immersion to conceptual repricing in final promise and "haunted euphoria... like a shawl," reconfiguring preservation with undeniable emotional cost of accepting change over stasis. Orientation anchored immediately (archivist on jetty at twilight). One tightening via locket examination narrows fear into deepening truth; closure Charged Poise legible with felt price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blooming jetty (sea lavender fragrance, temperature drop) and twilight constrain reflection, mirroring internal states through causal evolution (blooms closing as stars appear); charges final image of petals tucking against dark. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (archival steeping). Micro-setting (locket, water shards) guides choices and payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (regenerate covenant via gentle preservation) signaled early, escalates accumulatively to tightening in locket study foreclosing "freezing moments" option with trade-off of haunted joy's cost. Agency in patient examination and new promise; internal conflict weaves wants (hold perfect memory) vs. needs (allow breathing). Cost unmistakable in "joy was temporary yet choosing to embrace it."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation as "allowing them to breathe" emerges organically from tea-steeping metaphor and locket shift, reweighting premise in final image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to fear vs. examination. Subtext in sensory accumulation avoids platitudes. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (archival metaphors: walnut-ink, steeping, developing photo) biases noticing toward sensory memory; rhythmic control modulates from contemplative to charged poise at end. Close third stable, no elision issues. Prose texture lyrical yet legible under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "purple light bleed into the water like an old photograph developing" advances atmosphere, theme, voice). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; metaphors consistent (tea, ink) without muddle. Minor simile similarity purposeful for texture; closure image propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist frame transforms memory trope via walnut-ink specificity and jetty rituals; "regenerated covenant" inflection grows from particulars, risking lyric reflection that heightens stakes. Non-obvious angle on preservation inevitable in hindsight; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
