<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation to braid voices emerges concretely from trauma-rooted ritual (thumb on rosette); internal conflict in unlearning hatred shows contradictory impulses via patient teaching. Student's resigned posture forces micro-choice in scale lesson, revealing hierarchy of values. Closure endurance earned with felt cost of years' subtraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from backstory shards to student's shift, culminating in Charged Poise RR at "unlearning across years of small moments" with conceptual cost of patient erasure. Orientation anchored early (library, Eleanor). Single scene coherent, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Velvet library and autumn leaves constrain patient ritual, mirroring internal braid; zither rosette as micro-setting charges final image, reweighting premise. Sensory filter (worn edges, amber light) POV-specific, selective. Details evolve with student's emergence from pockets.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (braiding vanishing voices against hatred/silence) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via student's postural shift narrowing despair-to-hope options. Agency in scale choice forces endurance; cost legible in "imperceptibly, as all true change occurs."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of harmony via subtraction emerges from braid metaphor and noise-stripping, reweighted non-literally in final rosette image without moralizing. Particulars (dialect wounds, flat vowels) ground vanishing arts; ambiguity lingers in unlearned hatred's melody.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ( traveled silence, soft footfall) stable third-person limited; rhythm modulates from meditative to charged poise. No head-hopping; diction reflects choral bias (frequencies, resonant spaces). Minimal dialogue natural, subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (notes "rise and fall like autumn leaves"); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in reflections contained; closure image crisp, unblurred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of choral braid as hatred's unlearning transforms refugee trope via zither's generational wear. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick; inevitable in hindsight via rosette reprise.</comment>
