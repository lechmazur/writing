<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via sensory mapping of emotions; contradictory impulses peak in seeing looped selves yet lowering hand to accept wound as purpose, earning change with eternal weaving cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in "She lowered her hand... purpose, the particular weight of a truth finally set down"; orientation anchored early in Kepler-7 spaceport; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Catwalk and crane constrain climb/press action; sensory hierarchy (vibrations, murmur) mirrors internal thinning membrane, charging final descent image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redirect for withheld truth) deepens via loop realization, forcing renunciation with felt cost of perpetual mapping; agency tightens under Accumulative lens to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of seeing-as-wound emerges organically via shard/impressions; final image reweights gift-to-purpose without moral, resonant via "not peace, but purpose."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with perceptual signature (molecular etchings, cognitive wind); rhythmic modulation peaks in shimmer without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with zero loops; varied rhythm propels via image integration, no figurative muddle even in "reality's grip loosened."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory cartography and multiverse loops transforms tropes; risk in lyric introspection heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
