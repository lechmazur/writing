<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation to distill complexity is concrete and consistent, embodied through repeated needle touches that reveal character under the wait's subtle pressure. Interiority particular via rhythms and fog perceptions, avoiding stock phrases. No strong contradictory impulses act simultaneously; serene endurance lacks visible cost-scaled struggle, but fits single-POV reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from fog wait to barge arrival as cadence shift enabling CR closure. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (coachman at river crossing). Closure reconfigures promise via final needle touch and boarding, with conceptual cost of decades' transformation legible in "simpler and more profound."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fog, rain gutters ticking, and river stones vividly selective and purposeful, mirroring internal suspension and constraining wait. Sensory hierarchy reflects attentive POV (ticks measure pauses). Recurring fog/needle charges final barge image, guiding reflective choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (carrying/refining promise) signaled early; accumulative deepening via percolated understanding narrows to essence conviction. Barge arrival tightens as one sufficient cadence shift with felt endurance cost. Pressure coherent but low external opposition; no agency-driven reversal beyond presence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of continuity/distillation emerges organically from needle, fog waits, and evolving promise without statement. Final barge step offers resonant CR repricing prior material via "thread that connected all the others." Complexity embraced in palimpsest ambiguity; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: rhythms, fog shifts, needle tactility bias observations character-specifically. Prose texture rhythmic and modulated for serene intensity. Ferryman greeting natural and minimal; no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (e.g., gutter ticks propel pauses); syntactic propulsion matches reflective pace. Minor paraphrase loops on "promise" reframing (−0.4), but purposeful under accumulative lens. No scaffold, muddled figures, or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferryman trope with yarn needle palimpsest and distill motif transforms reflection into charged poise. Risky lyric stillness heightens thematic stakes organically. No derivative templates; particulars (gutters, spindrift) feel inevitable to voice.</comment>
