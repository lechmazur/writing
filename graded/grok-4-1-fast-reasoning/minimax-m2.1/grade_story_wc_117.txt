<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to nurture wonder is concrete and intensifies through adaptive choices like reading faces and silent presence. Interiority embodied in "ache of witnessing something sacred." Children's responses, especially Maya's touch, reveal relational crucible without stereotyping. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to totality hush, RR closure via Maya's touch solidifying memory with "familiar ache" cost. Orientation anchored early (Sage Ridge, eclipse). Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sage Ridge's liminal details (manzanita, dreaming roots) constrain choice and mirror internal states, charging final image. Eclipse light evolution sensory-selective via POV. Spatial choreography clear around granite outcropping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nurture wonder) signaled early, accumulative deepening via children's focus shift and totality forces stance crystallization. Maya's touch forecloses doubt with felt emotional cost. Minimal external pressure but coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary magic emerges via lullaby-to-silence progression and hair curl reprise, reweighting past to future in final reflection. Resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (honeyed light, breathing melody) modulates rhythmically with eclipse intensity. Stable single POV, minimal dialogue natural ("Listen"). No head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; figurative language purposeful without muddle in peak totality beat. No loops or scaffolds; final line recharges keepsake motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music therapy, eclipse, and keepsake transforms awe trope into nurtured wonder. Quiet risk-taking heightens emotional specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
