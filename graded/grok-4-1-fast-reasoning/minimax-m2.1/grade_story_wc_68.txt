<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority rooted in obsession with evidence, revealed concretely through cog handling and refusal of official narrative; embodied in patient salvage amid isolation. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "rational rebellion" borders therapy-speak but ties to micro-choice of continued work. Final endurance forecloses social acceptance with felt cost of endless labor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of artifacts building to Conceptual Repricing closure: final image of cataloging cog reweights truth-seeking premise with cost of incomplete lifetime work. Orientation anchored early in harbormaster's office ruins. No causality breaks; reflective shards cohere seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken harbor details (coral streets, silt plazas, water-stained walls) vividly constrain descent and salvage, mirroring internal layers; cog as micro-setting charges final collection image. Sensory hierarchy reflects scholarly bias toward evidentiary decay. Evolves causally with recovery actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth-preservation escalates accumulatively through artifact revelations narrowing options from acceptance to defiant endurance. Cog/deepens pressure, forcing trade-off of isolation vs. complicity. Cost legible in "years to fully catalog" and lifetime incompletion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Competing narratives emerge organically from sediment/artifacts vs. official lies, resonating in final refusal image that reweights preservation as costly defiance without moralizing. Particulars like guild evacuations ground complexity; ambiguity lingers in power's convenience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sedimentary metaphors and precise diction reflects obsessive mind; syntax modulates from calm description to charged resolve. Stable first-person focalization biases toward evidence over senses. Rhythmic control heightens reflective pressure without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful "sedimentary layers" recurrence teaches pattern without looping. No scaffold or artifacts dull closure; concrete images propel via multi-job lines like cog's "sharp teeth despite submersion."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-plague archaeologist defying engineered myths via drowned artifacts; cog transforms navigation trope into evidence of forgotten precision. Bold reflective voice risks abstraction but grounds in tactile salvage, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
