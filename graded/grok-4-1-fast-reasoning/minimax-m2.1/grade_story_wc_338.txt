<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority rooted in map-framing empathy drives restraint at close; embodied in descent and projection setup. Minor abstract telling in "methodically curious" traits slightly dilutes contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: film differences deepen evidence density to doorway reveal, culminating in CR closure of reverent exit with cost of unforced silence. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via vault entry suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rain-scoured frescoes constrain observation and charge dawn henge exit image; selective sensory filter (ghostly impressions, flickering projections) mirrors POV priorities. Body as micro-setting in descent pressures patient reading.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interpret without forcing) tightens accumulatively via film-to-vault progression, narrowing to renunciation cost in final climb. Agency in documentation/endurance forecloses exploration path legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of patient silence as pregnant revelation emerges organically from particulars; final image reconfigures "forcing open doors" premise non-literally. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in inheritors' reverence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (silence as full, maps tearing) modulates rhythmically; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays in charged close. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops ("silence" patterns purposeful yet edging repetition; "whispered chapel" reprise). No closure-dulling artifacts; propulsion clear in projection beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartographic silence and film forensics transforms archaeological trope; risk in lyric restraint heightens thematic stakes without gimmick.</comment>
