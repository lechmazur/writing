<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in patient salvage work, intensifying to compel naming the child; interiority concrete via weaving images and dream fragments. Limited contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—steady competence without strong embodied conflict. Final purpose realization earned by prior piecing, with felt cost of ending preservation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dream cameos and globe dissolution builds to Charged Poise closure in "she would give the nameless girl her voice at last," reconfiguring options with conceptual cost of anchoring memory. Orientation anchored early in glacier shrine. Single scene fits defaults, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glacier shrine and melting snow globe constrain patient analysis and charge final image of dawn bleeding through blue walls. Sensory hierarchy vivid and selective: flickering candles, glacial air, cloudy depths reflect priorities. Environment mirrors internal weaving without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of salvaging child's name signaled early, tightens via dream accumulation narrowing to exposure; agency in analysis forecloses silence with cost of scattering truth. Escalation under Accumulative lens: pattern break in knowing song/flowers reweights stake. Cost legible in "work here was nearly finished."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of rescuing pure memory from loss emerges organically from dream fragments and globe; final image of borrowed starlight offers resonant answer to silencing grief without moral. Subtext in stubborn testimony resists tidy resolution. Particulars like child's song avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in poetic diction ("weaving truth carefully," "borrowed starlight"); rhythmic control modulates reflective intensity. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure. Voice as character: syntax reflects patient listening mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with poetic propulsion, high density in image integration; minor paraphrase loops ("weaving truth," snow globe dissolving repeated) but purposeful in lyric accumulation. No scaffold or muddled metaphors—figurative language coherent, voice-motivated. Closure image clear without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-cameos as ghost-whispering in glacier shrine transforms salvage trope; risk in elliptical accumulative structure heightens stakes of memory's fragility. Non-obvious angle on loss via strangers' borrowed fragments feels inevitable at voice-giving closure.</comment>
