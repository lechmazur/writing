<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and embodied emotion peak in memory flood ("heart hammering against her ribs"), with contradictory impulses (empirical calm vs. visceral unease) driving earned final renunciation of Chen's influence; Chen link feels slightly unearned despite diagnostic insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via deepening observations to memory flood and CR closure in report-filing with prepared copies as felt cost ("knowing Chen would attempt to bury it"); orientation anchored early in descent, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel micro-setting (watermark, beam collapse) constrains positioning and charges final lantern image; sensory hierarchy reflects empirical POV bias, with vibration mirroring internal resonance purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. institutional cover) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through skeleton positioning to memory revelation narrowing options; agency in precise documentation forecloses compliance path with legible resistance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of illuminated buried truths emerges organically via lantern motif shifting from escape to confrontation, resonant CR in dawn/rain image reweighting denial without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in empirical noticing ("wear patterns on the bone"); rhythmic modulation under stress (short sentences in gasp) enhances pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/sensory (lantern flicker with rumble), varied rhythm propels to closure; minor overwriting in reflective backstory block but anchored without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empirical investigator with entangled historical memories transforms cover-up trope; lantern's generational reprise feels inevitable, risking supernatural element grounded in realism.</comment>
