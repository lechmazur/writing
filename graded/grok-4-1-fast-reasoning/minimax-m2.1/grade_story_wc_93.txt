<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied curse ("visions that burned behind her eyes like embers") and promise as "second heartbeat" create contradictory impulses acting in the reach, earning the transformative stasis with visible cost of all star dust.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density to CR closure in "the borrowed dawn did not fade but spread," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of expended dust and joined geometry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frictionless bluff and painted rocks constrain rock placement and her slide-resistant step, charging final eel alignment image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eels mirroring sequence deepens stake from catching to joining, driven by her rock placement agency; cost of final dust grains legible in the reach under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Eels rising "like a constellation becoming real" resonantly answers promise via pattern connection, reweighting catching to joining without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("ribbons of liquid mercury") selective to sacred geometry sustains single POV stability and rhythm to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or artifacts; high density propels via "living geometry that mirrored her painted rocks exactly" without figurative muddle in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frictionless world plus math-eel sequences and star-dust patterns synthesize fresh inevitability, with pattern-joining risk heightening closure stakes.</comment>
