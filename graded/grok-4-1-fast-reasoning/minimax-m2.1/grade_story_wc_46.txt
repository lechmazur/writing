<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (restless ache vs pearl of stillness) act concretely in polishing scene; final purpose rekindled earned by 17-year skill build with grief as visible cost. Interiority particular via tactile fingers tracing walls/curves.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density from pearl find→memories→polish→light release tightens to CR closure ("never truly fallen"), cost legible in transformed grief/patience in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto/mist constrains polishing by feel, charges closure as light spreads passages; body/tools (fingers, cloth) as micro-setting enable reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim radiance post-loss) signaled early via basket-weighing; deepening via pearl polish forecloses ascent option with endurance cost felt in "quiet communion."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (grief→shared light sans fire) emerges from particulars like clouded pearl clearing; final image reweights premise without moral, resonant via starlight scent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases to light/scattered colors; stable close-3rd POV with rhythmic modulation peaks in polish beat, no elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful light motifs; minor artifact in "柔软的布料" proofreading slip dulls one line, but rhythm propels without loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh mythic synthesis transforms wing-loss trope via tactile polish/pearl logic; quiet CR risks bold lyric closure heightening stakes organically.</comment>
