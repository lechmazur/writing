<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in integrity endures with earned shift to action, embodied in courtyard senses and journals as witnesses; minor slip in tidy crystallization ("Her motivation crystallized") lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with knowledge deepening from intuition to message to plan; Charged Poise closure legible in pigeon attachment with risk to peace as felt cost; orientation anchored early in courtyard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Courtyard at dusk (fountain, jasmine, aviary) mirrors stakes and constrains via safe isolation turned launchpad; charges final image of securing tube, reweighting tranquility with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. isolation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via message revelation narrowing to lateral action; cost legible in foreclosed hiding, felt in courtyard peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of observation-to-integrity action emerges organically from data, poison reveal, and pigeon reprise; final securing image resonates without moralizing, reweighting records as witnesses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with meteorological perceptual signature (humidity/electricity metaphors); rhythmic control modulates reflective density to charged poise without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors integrated into beats; minor paraphrase loop in lateral progress reflection, but no closure touch or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather data exposing quarantine fraud via pigeons transforms tropes; risk in obsolete comms heightens stakes organically.</comment>
