<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via concrete perceptions like reading falcon's eye and condensation as rivers; motivation intensifies through symbol-to-phrasebook linkage, earning discovery stance. Subtle confidence and dismissal by peers create blind spots without overt contradiction. Final micro-choice to embrace proof feels earned, foreclosing doubt with isolation's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from falcon's leaf/symbol to phrasebook "origin," yielding Charged Poise CR in final image of water seeking level. Orientation anchored early (outpost, lake, editor's quest). Cost legible in "worrying tranquility" and "long uncertainty," reconfiguring quest without causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via condensation patterns revealing topography, charging closure image ("contours already visible in the condensation"). Sensory hierarchy (frost clock, ice cracks) reflects Miriam's priorities. Rusted outpost and lake evolve with falcon's arrival, mirroring internal discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove convergence/origin) signaled early, tightens texturally via leaf/symbol confirming myth. One deepening narrows to "origin," forcing realization under isolation pressure. Cost felt in tranquility's "worrying" pause, charging final poise without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of water finding belonging emerges organically from droplets, rivers, leaf; final image reweights particulars (silence as discovery cost) without moral. Subtext in symbol's age implies reverence, complicating atlas authority. Resonance lingers via ambiguity of "origin."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: landscapes as language ("map waiting to be read"). Rhythmic prose modulates from observation to charged pause. No elision issues; diction biased toward geography (e.g., "topography of the world beyond").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "droplets travel, tracing...tiny rivers" advances plot/atmosphere). Rhythm varies; water motifs pattern-taught without muddle. Minor figurative density in opening fits voice; no loops dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: falcon messages, condensation cartography transform explorer trope into textural quest. Symbol/leaf turn grows from established atlas methods. Risks quiet CR effectively, heightening isolation stakes.</comment>
