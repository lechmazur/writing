<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses surface in embodied reverse-telling—"words came slowly at first, tasting strange"—earning final renunciation of conquestive art with visible cost to self-image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reverse-telling deepens density to CR closure; story stick left behind makes cost legible in final image of "horizontal monument."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome's platform impression constrains stick-planting ritual and acoustics amplify whispers, charging closure image without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant ethical stake tightens via reverse-action under Accumulative lens, forcing stance crystallization; cost felt in abandoning "territorial conquest" and leaving stick.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of incomplete stories emerges implicitly via reverse process; final stick image offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting premise through dangling thread.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in phrases like "half-lit epiphanies," rhythmic control heightens pressure to serene realization without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; minor "epiphanies" recurrence accumulates texturally without obscuring closure, though borders loop in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Reverse-telling in dome synthesizes fresh angle on narrative ethics; risky conceit inevitable from calligrapher's precision, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
