<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of "furiously tranquil" act in the stormlit vigil, earning the final writing act with the cost of years' silence visible in the self-imposed pause.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as storm density and reflections build to Conceptual Repricing closure; cost legible in "she had been the one holding it in suspension all along," reweighting the vigil's premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stormlit dome and misted glass constrain the vigil and charge the final writing image; sensory details like thunderheads churning below mirror internal cartography without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming voice escalates via storm-deepening under textural lens, narrowing to renunciation of waiting with cost in scarred history; minor abstractness in early stake signal holds back 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of scars-as-maps emerges organically from verses and final mist-writing image, offering non-literal reconfiguration of silence as self-cartography without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in photographic/poetic bias ("truth, like photographs, needed darkness"); rhythmic control modulates from stillness to storm intensity seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels through storm peak; minor metaphor density in reflective beats ("cartography of scars") risks slight overwrite but pays off in closure image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of censorship vigil as photographic development transforms trope via bus timetable/envelope mechanics; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
