<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (scar bite, ribcage hum) roots motivation in rooted constraint, earning the planting choice; purposeful curiosity shows as gift/burden without label-speak. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in the pivotal planting beat prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising to eclipse/planting CR closure; cost legible in "piercing fire" illumination foreclosing rooted isolation. Orientation anchors immediately in glade; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt glade/violet earth constrain rooted choices and charge final expansion image; sensory hierarchy (static air, rustle) reflects visionary bias, evolving causally with dusk eclipse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heed covenant to bridge futures) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via clipping plant tightening options; agency/cost in "blazed with sudden fire" reweights rooted stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rooted expansion emerges organically via glade/covenant particulars, resonant CR in final spillover reweighting isolation without moral; lingering ambiguity in "quiet certainty" invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (tendrils in soil, shadows stretching); rhythmic diction modulates from anxious buildup to poised close, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops ("purposefully curious," "anxious elation" reprise without fresh pressure) and heavy figuration in peak planting slightly dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rooted visionary trope via clipping/covenant scars transforms into dream-intersection CR; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
