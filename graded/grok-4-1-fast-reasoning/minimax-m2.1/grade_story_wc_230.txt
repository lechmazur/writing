<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (radiant truthfulness as adaptation making her a target) act in embodied interiority, earning final endurance; micro-choices like navigating wreckage reveal rational forager traits under isolation pressure. Flawless integration without diagnostic labels or tidy paths. Final settling into hollow confronts her flaws' cost convincingly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ruin-reading, persistence motifs tighten to Charged Poise closure in hollow placement, reconfiguring isolation into rebellion with legible conceptual cost ("quiet rebellion"). Orientation anchored immediately; no causality breaks, one meaningful deepening via arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Hanging orchard constrains climb (roots gripping stone mirror her persistence) and charges final image (hollow unites artifacts); sensory details (sap cool against thigh, battered ravine) selectively bias through forager POV, evolving causally with storm. No white-room; micro-setting indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate safety vs. viral isolation) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via climb's risks narrowing to endurance choice; agency in hiding/studying forecloses paths with felt target cost. Minor abstractness in stakes doesn't touch closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of persistence amid catastrophe emerges organically from orchard parallels and relic placement, offering resonant non-literal answer (memory's endurance) that reweights premise without moralizing; final image charges ambiguity meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct forager perceptual signature ("read these ruins... like forest floors"); rhythmic prose modulates from urgent climb to poised study, no head-hopping or withholdings; diction reflects embodied, biased noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short climb sentences propel, longer reflections breathe); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—e.g., "mouth... open wound" integrates without overwriting. Minor register elevation in reflections doesn't dull closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empathy virus, glass eye neurology, and symbiotic orchard transforms isolation tropes into inevitable fractured grace; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, fully committing to premise implications.</comment>
