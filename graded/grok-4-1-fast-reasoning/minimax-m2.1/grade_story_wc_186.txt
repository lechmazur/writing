<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's retrocognition and custodianship traits motivate sensing the disturbance and finding/investigating the prism consistently, with embodied emotions like "heart ache" and "prickle." Internal conflict emerges mildly in questioning the prism's potential amid eleven years' isolation, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal discovery beat. Final realization feels earned via prior causality without safety-hedging, though epiphanic tone borders unearned at "proving coincidences had meaning."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pavilion hum to prism discovery to star-path realization, culminating in Charged Poise CR at final image of pavilion "vibrat[ing] ... as if in approval" with conceptual cost of fragile hope sustained through ruin. Orientation anchored early ("beacon-tower custodian ... glass wall"). Single scene coherent, closure legible with undeniable price in "thistle-blown hope ... persistent."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "cold glass wall ... subtle vibration" and "broken crystal prism ... scattered ... rainbows" filter through Elara's POV bias, constraining choices (kneel to investigate, plan tower climb). Pavilion and tower evolve, mirroring internal states and charging closure ("humming pavilion vibrated beneath her feet"). Micro-setting (prism, hum) shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle connection/prove meaning) signaled early via hum disturbance, escalates accumulatively through prism discovery deepening options/knowledge to ascent plan, forcing stance crystallization. Agency in investigation and decision to climb shows trade-off (trust gift amid isolation). Cost legible in "fragile and prickly but persistent" hope at climax, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of meaning in coincidences emerges organically from retrocognition patterns, prism communion, and star paths, with final image reassembling "shattered pieces ... into something that hummed with purpose" offering resonant CR without moralizing. Subtext in "spaces between thoughts" enriches ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from proving hope's persistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (retrocognitive "connections where others saw chaos"), modulating rhythm with intensity (short sentences in discovery). Purposeful lyrical compression taught early via hum patterns, legible at closure. No dialogue; diction biased to character's cosmic attunement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "broken crystal prism caught ... scattered ... rainbows" advances setting/action/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("lullaby of frequencies," "thistle-blown hope") consistent but borders muddle in reflective blocks; no loops, scaffold clean. Closure image propels crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-collapse retrocognition, "shard of hush" prism, and star-path custodianship transforms tropes into organic quest for meaning. Risky lyric tone heightens stakes via cosmic intimacy; final reconfiguration ("even shattered pieces could be reassembled") inevitable from particulars, no derivatives.</comment>
