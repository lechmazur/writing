<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via trembling fingers and loud breath under charged air; methodical hope compels decoding until epiphany. Change from loneliness to hopeful sleep earned by prior symbol work. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal revelation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via sharper daydreams to CR closure: understanding language as living kindness, cost legible in "long loneliness of believing that kindness vanished like smoke." Single scene oriented early; one meaningful cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse's jasmine-earth air and painting corner constrain creation; moonlight on brush charges final image where it "resting in moonlight." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific, selective under insomnia urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode language/prove kindness endures) signaled early, tightens via charged daydream revelation narrowing isolation options. Protagonist agency in hand moving to write forecloses loneliness with felt cost; lens-consistent escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of echoing kindness emerges via chain vision and final phrase "Someone was kind to me, and I remember," reweighting lost language without moralizing. Resonant CR in decision to leave paintings lingers via ambiguity of future finders.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("saffron quiet," moon-held silver) biases toward sensory hope; rhythmic modulation accelerates in epiphany. Stable single POV with no elision; Accumulative texture taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates sense/action ("breath feel loud"); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or scaffold. Figurative language purposeful in lyric mode, no muddle in peak "hand moved without permission."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lost language as kindness chain via moon-tipped brush transforms insomnia trope into fresh CR; rooftop insomniac communion risks lyric boldness heightening stakes organically.</comment>
