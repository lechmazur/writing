<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation rooted in mediator role intensifies credibly to spell-casting choice; interiority concrete via bird calls and pod texture. Embodied patience contrasts greed indifference without therapy-speak. No strong contradictory impulses act simultaneously, but endurance earns stasis with felt cost in final smile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of death images breaks with green thread DC/CR, reweighting restoration stake; cost legible in "delivered their final passenger to a shore they never expected." Orientation anchored early (coachman/jetty/gloom-hill). Single scene coherent, no shards/transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Jetty's "narrow vastness" and reef "ribs" constrain planting at edge and charge final green thread; sensory hierarchy (bird calls over visuals) POV-specific. Atmosphere tensions death/renewal purposefully. Evolving mud/water mirrors restoration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore via seeds/spell) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via birds' "new" cries to reef response; agency in intentional spell forecloses indifference path. Cost felt in patience vs. "human indifference"; no reversals needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of intention vs. indifference emerges from pods/reef images, resonant CR in garden reclaiming "battlefield" without moralizing. Final thread reweights chorus motif organically. Complexity lingers in drowned cities' whispers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (bird/dead language bias); lyrical diction/rhythm modulate to charged poise at "first green thread." No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors cohere (reef "ribs"/"tomb") without muddle in planting beat. No loops/artifacts; propulsion peaks at "fertilization spell" into silence break. Strategic telling anchors backstory efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferryman restoring reef via dead tongues/birds transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric frame heightens stakes; coachman's "final passenger" turn inevitable from pod constraint. No derivative echoes.</comment>
