<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory machine-organic impulses (pulsing hands, static as grief) drive miniaturization choice, earning fragmented wholeness with visible cost in final fragmentation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of fears/chaos builds to CR of inner north; cost legible in "felt herself fragmenting, breaking into all the moments," reconfiguring options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dome hum and dying roses constrain ordinary repair, mirroring static; final petals lifting charges closure image as micro-setting payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (resolve static/save roses) deepens via controlled burn realization, narrowing to containment agency; cost in self-fragmentation charges ending under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fragmented wholeness emerges from fears-roses-chaos particulars; final image of carried fears reweights containment premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (organic-titanium pulse, sky ribbons) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates to charged poise at peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Purposeful density with varied rhythm, but figurative overload (e.g., "shredded the sky into ribbons") borders coherence in peak without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android soul via fears-box-roses burn transforms chaos trope; risk of lyric containment heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
