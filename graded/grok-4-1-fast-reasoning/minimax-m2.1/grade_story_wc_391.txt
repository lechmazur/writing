<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via vibrations in teeth and skull syncs motivation to embodied release; restrained wildness as contradictory impulse acts in palm-on-stone micro-choice, earning final unyoking with lifelong cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as moon paths densify to viaduct hum and landscape shift; CR closure in "patient revolution...flowering" reconfigures boundaries with conceptual cost of eternal wait legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Basalt warmth and lake groans constrain patient tracking and charge unyoking beat; sensory hierarchy (ice cracks as messages, lunar rivers) mirrors cartographer's priorities without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of patient revolution signaled early tightens via viaduct discovery to unyoking cadence shift; agency in endurance forecloses impatience path, but abstract stakes dilute visceral cost at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of patience sculpting liberation emerges from moon-silver lines to spring-change image without statement; resonant CR reweights impatience as durable force, lingering via thin-boundary motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (horizons touching stone, invisible rivers) biases toward cosmic patience; rhythmic modulation heightens under viaduct hum without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density weaves action, sensation, reflection without loops dulling propulsion; minor "patient" repetition and elevated diction in peak unyoking slightly overload rhythm but spare closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Magnetic viaduct as nexus transforms borderland tropes via mineral awakening and moon-ice mechanics; fresh synthesis of cartographic vigilance and geologic memory risks bold lyric closure payoff.</comment>
