<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marcus's polished calm and father's influence drive micro-choices like pulling the foreign bill, earning Elena's shift; contradictory startup ambitions layer realistically. Elena's brittle laugh reveals embodied conflict under pressure. Minor label-speak ("perceptively calm") slightly abstracts her trait without full tradeoff visibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: metaphor density builds from circus cars to startup territories, culminating in Charged Poise closure when Elena asks for help dissuading others, reweighting acquisition with dissolution cost. Orientation anchors early via clearing and cars. Single scene causality intact, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Circus train setting charges choices—Marcus gestures to ringmaster's car as pivot for remaking territory—constraining acquisition debate via tactile exploration. Sensory details (rusted paint, weathered wood, dusk light) filter through Marcus's perceptual bias, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dissuade sale) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via metaphor deepening from father's bill to train ecosystem, forcing Elena's stance crystallization with felt cost of erasure vs. dissolution. Her laugh-to-understanding cadence shift narrows options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Territories as stories emerges organically from circus/startup parallels, reweighted in final walk where circling paths accept cost without tidy moral. Dusky harmony motif shifts from Elena's voice to evening, charging closure image non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV to Marcus with distinct perceptual signature (reading landscapes like father); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven (Elena's "clean" vs. Marcus's philosophy). Rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence length; motifs like "dusky harmony" taught early without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops ("territories" phrasing repeats thrice in exposition beats) dull mid-section propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Highway robber son in VC with circus metaphor transforms startup tropes into fresh territorial philosophy; final money-weight image inevitable from setup. Bold synthesis of itinerant dreams and ambition circles without hedging.</comment>
