<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in avoiding the hall despite belief in measurable silence earn the final realization; "motion could speak when voice could not" embodies survival traits concretely.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as mappings densify to hall's "pulsing waves"; CR closure lands with conceptual cost in "hear with different senses entirely."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory's residue constrains choices and charges realization; "frosted panes... like musical notation" filters through Elara's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake to rectify via mapping tightens accumulatively in hall's layered histories, foreclosing avoidance with overwhelm's felt cost; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image reweights silence-as-loss to emotion-preserved resonance without moral; "unshaken marvels" emerges organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in thermal-as-emotion; "air pulsed... as if breathing" modulates rhythm purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; minor overwriting in "frost patterns like notation" purposeful, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Thermal emotion-mapping post-Quieting synthesizes fresh angle on silence; hall's breathing air risks boldly for inevitable CR.</comment>
