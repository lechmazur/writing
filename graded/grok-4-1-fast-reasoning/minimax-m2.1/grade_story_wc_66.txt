<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in patient preservation intensifies credibly to the dust discovery and tonight's broadcast; interiority concrete via embodied details like mist acclimation and glow affection. Micro-choices like cloaking the radio reveal values under patrol pressure. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, slightly limiting 9+; endurance feels earned without deep flaws complicating peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layers build from copying to pirate broadcasts to dust memory, tightening to Charged Poise closure as she sings and dust stirs. Orientation anchored early in alcove amid mist/post-famine. Cost legible in "secret luminous glow pulse once in acknowledgment" amid patrols; persistent radio constraint shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist, ember alcove, dust constrain choices (e.g., cloaked glow avoids patrols, dust shifts with hums). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: glow loved over lamps, dust as scientific wonder. Final mist "drawing closer" and dust stirring charge closure image, mirroring internal resolve. No generic placeholders; all purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve stories via secret broadcasts) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via dust revelation narrowing to "particular care" tonight. Agency in coaxing dust/singing forecloses detection path with felt patrol risk. One tightening suffices; cost visible in cloaked preparations but lacks live trade-off in peak beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of stories regenerating in dust/song emerges organically from particulars, reweighted in final "dust...stir with anticipation" as non-literal answer to famine loss. Subtext in lyrics "slippery...to patrols" invites reflection without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable; lingering ambiguity in dust's "real" memory adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature: musical bias in "every note preserved was a story saved," mist-softened ghosts. Lyrical rhythm modulates calmly to poised intensity at "began to sing." No elision or head-hopping; diction controlled, voice distinct and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "mist rolled...finding its way" builds atmosphere/action). Varied rhythm, no loops obscuring closure; minor mist repetition purposeful for textural build. Slight overwriting in stacked descriptors ("thistled calm...gentle determination") during prep but doesn't dull final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dust absorbing stories, broadcast via lyrics cloaking, post-famine "story" literalized ingeniously. Risk in "teaching dust to speak" transforms preservation trope; inevitable hindsight via scientific discovery to singing closure. No derivatives; bold conceptual integrity heightens stakes.</comment>
