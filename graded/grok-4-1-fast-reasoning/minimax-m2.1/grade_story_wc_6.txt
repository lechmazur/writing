<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (sand on cheek evokes father) and earned endurance in final rise, with contradictory impulses (restlessness vs. compassion) shown through micro-choices like gripping coin. Minor slip: limited on-page pressure for micro-choices, tilting reflective over conflicted action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density builds to CR closure: "her father's flames and her own water were part of the same eternal dance," reweighting loss with renewal cost (unbowed but scarred). Orientation anchored early (~50 words); one tightening via deepening realization suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lagoon, sand, and clouds constrain reflection and charge final image (water from "black mirror to molten gold"); sensory hierarchy (tactile sand heat, visual light shift) reflects firefighter POV bias toward fire metaphors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (redeem destruction via purpose) signaled early, tightens texturally to realization narrowing options (choose light over destruction); cost legible in "not healed but healing." Entry to high band via felt price charging image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of scars-as-song emerges organically from sand/coin/water images shifting to renewal; final image offers non-literal resonant answer ("eternal dance") reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (fire/light metaphors); rhythmic control modulates from calm to charged rise, prose texture lyrical yet legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops; figurative language purposeful and coherent (sand "powdered obsidian," lagoon "pull[ing] light"), taught early with closure payoff despite prevalence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist-daughter firefighter at volcanic site transforms fire trope via lyric renewal arc; risk in plotless reflection heightens stakes through image inevitability.</comment>
