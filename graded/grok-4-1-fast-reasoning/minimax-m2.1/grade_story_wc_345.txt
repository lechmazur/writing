<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Collective characterization shows earned changes like Eli's confidence and Lena's generosity, rooted in prior neglect; interiority concrete but collective rather than sharply individual. Closing ring by Eli reveals values under pressure with visible communal cost. Minor slip: archetypal summaries slightly dilute contradiction in pivotal restoration beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: messages accumulate to gathering, restoration, bloom—tightening via persistence to Charged Poise closure when Eli rings bell, reconfiguring isolation to unity with effort cost legible in "gentle rain." Orientation anchored early in orchard/Outpost. No causality breaks; shards cohere to single drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating arches "lean closer" during restoration and cast shadows merging in climax, constraining communal work and charging final rain image. Sensory details (mists, silver leaves, chrysalides) filter through urgency, mirroring internal shift from neglect. Micro-setting of bell/garden evolves causally, indispensable to payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival frenzy vs. deeper communal hope) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ignored messages to collective restoration, narrowing to bell-ringing agency with sweat/laughter cost. Final image crystallizes stance with undeniable relational price. Coheres under Textural lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of chosen family emerges organically from chalked maps to wings unfurling, resonant non-literal answer in "family by choice" without moralizing. Returning garden motif shifts from choked neglect to blessing. Complexity lingers in "brambled" prior isolation, inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person collective POV stable, perceptual signature biased toward spectral wonder (Mira's "ghost whose presence felt less like haunting"). Rhythmic control modulates from misty dawn to rain cadence; purposeful compression teaches pattern early, legible at closure. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: sentences layer sensory/atmospheric propulsion (e.g., "nebula of respite... seemed to brighten" closes with image-charge). Varied rhythm avoids loops; no artifacts, overwriting, or muddle in peak bloom/ring beat. Concision weaves detail into action seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spectral guide + alien orchard transforms communal trope via chalked persistence and bell-summoned rain. Risky collective voice heightens stakes organically; final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars, no derivative hedging.</comment>
