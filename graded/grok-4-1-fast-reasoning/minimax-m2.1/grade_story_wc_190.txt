<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's embodied monitoring of storm glass and precise humming reveal character-particular logic under subtle pressure; grandmother's teaching anchors motivation with concrete cue tilting present choice. Minimal internal contradiction shown acting simultaneously limits to very strong; boy's passivity prevents relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of silence and color shifts builds to Resonant Reconfiguration closure; "storm glass had settled into a perfect, crystalline clarity" makes before/after legible with felt emotional cost of unseen transformation. Orientation anchored early in prism terrace; single scene fits scope without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism terrace's refraction and acoustics constrain choices by enabling light/vapor work and frequency matching; storm glass vial as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory details (light spectrums, vapor scent) filtered through Maren's professional bias integrate purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (soothe boy's tempest) signaled early tightens accumulatively via trajectory shift and hum; agency in micro-choices forecloses nightmare path with felt cost in glass's violet-to-blue shift. Entry to high band as pressure coheres but cost remains oblique emotional labor without sharper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-comfort emerges organically from vial, hum, and glass clarity without statement; final image reconfigures grandmother's gift as subconscious passing-forward with resonant ambiguity. Particulars (whimper frequency, vaulting hush) yield emotional aftereffect avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (spaces between sounds) modulates rhythmically; POV stable in Maren's fluid logic without leakage. Purposeful compression of hush patterns taught early pays off legibly at closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image integration; figurative language ("cathedral ceiling," "architecture of silence") coherent and pattern-taught without muddle or loops in peak hum beat. Zero scaffolds; sentence propulsion matches emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence catalysis in prism transit transforms tropes via specific vial mechanics and subconscious teaching; risk in lyric hush texture heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from glass shifts without derivative echoes.</comment>
