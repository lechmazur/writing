<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strength: contradictory fear/readiness impulses act via spice-crushing micro-choice, earning expansion as bridge; embodied grief via tasted/scented memories avoids labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent-density builds to CR closure ("love larger than death") with unraveling cost legible in "gentle unraveling of everything she had believed"; orientation anchored by orchard/fortune early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard/stones constrain ritual choices (kneel, release spices); moonlight pools charge final image, mirroring internal transformation; sensory bias (scent-dominant) reflects whisperer priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforge bond via metamorphosis) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through spice breaths narrowing human self; agency in conjuring forecloses prior fear with felt unraveling cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (bonds refined beyond death) emerges from spice/memories/particulars, reweighted in final image without moralizing; phoenix/fortune reprise shifts premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (emotions as smelled/tasted); rhythmic modulation builds incantatory texture matching cosmic intimacy; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm; flaw: simile stacks ("like a living thing, like the first breath") border overwriting in peak transformation beat, dulling one closure edge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: scent-conjuring for soul-bridge transforms whisperer trope; risk of lyric metamorphosis pays off in charged poise without gimmick.</comment>
