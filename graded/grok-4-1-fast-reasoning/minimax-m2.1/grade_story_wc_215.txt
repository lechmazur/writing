<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's shift from astonished recluse to covenant keeper is earned through embodied stiffness in legs and gradual acceptance, with contradictory lightness/crushing weight at closure revealing internal conflict. Interiority concrete and particular via perceptual details like light through comb. No unearned epiphanies; micro-choices align with observation turning active.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setting observation to ghost gesture to box discovery, culminating in Charged Poise RR where covenant passes with legible cost ("impossible lightness and its crushing weight"). Single scene oriented early (apiary in wasteland by para 1). Closure decisive on-page without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting as micro-world (beekeeping skeletons, cracked earth) constrains digging choice and charges final lap image with box amid ruins. Sensory selectivity (amber light, dry earth) POV-biased toward tranquil perception, mirroring internal states without overt symbols. Spatial coherence flawless; evolves with ghost fade.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving unspoken covenants) signaled early via apiary draw, tightens via ghost's gesture narrowing passive observation into active digging under Accum lens. Agency in unearthing/accepting forecloses recluse isolation with felt weight cost. Minor abstractness in stakes prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silent covenants emerges organically from bee remnants to box to Mira's inheritance, with final image resonating non-literally via "eloquence of silence" reweighting isolation. Subtext in ghost's gesture and fade invites ambiguity without confusion. No moralizing; complexity in fragile promises lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature ("light moved through broken comb"), modulating rhythm to pressure (short digging sentences vs. lyrical close). Voice lyrical yet controlled, biased noticing (moth wings, honey fragments). No head-hopping; compression purposeful for Accum lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (e.g., "She dug with her hands, the earth dry and reluctant but willing"); propulsion strong to closure. Minor paraphrase loop on "weight of unspoken words" (paras 2,5) dulls slightly (-0.4); figs coherent and purposeful, no muddle in peak dig/accept beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-fire ghosts, beekeeping ruins, stained glass covenants transforms wasteland tropes into inevitable perceptual arc. Risky lyric Accum drive heightens stakes via silence's weight without gimmick. No derivatives; particular details (fractured glass bees) irreplaceable.</comment>
