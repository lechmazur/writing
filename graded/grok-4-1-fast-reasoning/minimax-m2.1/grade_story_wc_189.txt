<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira's chronicler trait yields concrete interiority and micro-choices like pressing the cicada to her lips, revealing contradictory pain and presence; sister's minimal presence still pressures via profile and softened speech. Earned offering forecloses retreat with relational cost. Minor slip: epiphanic summaries slightly abstract impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of tidal/cicada images building to RR closure ("something shifted. The tide was turning"), with felt relational cost in offering amid silence. Single scene anchored early; one tightening via extended awareness to hand reaching out. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto's carved walls and starlit pool constrain patient stasis, mirroring internal transition and charging final image of diamonds in water; tactile jade and water rhythm filter through Mira's bias. Sensory hierarchy sharpens urgency of pause.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconcile rift as transition) signaled early, tightens texturally via awareness "extend[ing] outward" to offering, narrowing retreat; agency in placement forecloses path with embodied chest tension as cost. Escalation coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of liminal forgiveness emerges organically from particulars like cicada pulse and tide turning, with final dialogue reweighting silence non-literally; ambiguity lingers in "wholeness again" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in edge-noticing ("spaces where meaning slipped"); dialogue natural/subtextual ("You still collect things") advances rift. Rhythmic modulation fits reflective intensity; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene breath (short sentences in offering build), high density in image clusters; minor paraphrase loops on "transition" (repeated 5x without full payoff) dull peak density. No filter stacks or muddled metaphors touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal chronicler frame transforms reconciliation trope; cicada/grotto particulars make angle inevitable, risking lyric reflection without gimmick.</comment>
