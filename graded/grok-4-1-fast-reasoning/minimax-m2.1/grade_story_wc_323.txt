<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Anchor link reveals character through embodied ritual and ties grandmother's wisdom to alien knowledge, grounding curiosity in contradiction between old/current wisdoms. Final handling earns endurance with felt continuity cost. Minor lack of on-page internal contradiction under peak realization keeps it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as meditative calculations build density to CR closure: "Mira understood then why the aliens had shared," reweighting navigation premise with departure cost legible in message screen. Orientation anchored early in descent. Single shard fits scope; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Benthic city's bioluminescent haze and filtered starlight constrain calculations, mirroring internal expansion; anchor as micro-setting grounds body in alien "edges." Final streets image charges CR. Sensory filter via Mira's navigation bias selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (starlight navigation) signaled early, tightens via Chen's message forcing conceptual repricing; agency in "expand[ing] her calculations" endures isolation cost under lens. Departure stakes felt but lack physical trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of invisible connections emerges via anchor-chain motif shifting from grounding to cosmic navigation, resonant in final image without moralizing. Aliens' departure reweights horizons non-literally. Avoids platitudes through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean third-limited POV with perceptual signature in water/starlight noticing; brief dialogue natural/subtextual on anchor. Voice modulates meditatively to charged close. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/reflection; rhythm meditative then poignant. Minor paraphrase on "anchor link" (chest→belt→hand) purposeful, not looped. "Unfold-ed" typo minor; no filter stacks or muddle in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-contact benthic nav with ancestral anchor transforms first-contact trope via edge geometry/chain math. Risky quiet CR inevitable from particulars; no derivative echoes.</comment>
