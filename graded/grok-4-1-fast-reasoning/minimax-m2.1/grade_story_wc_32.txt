<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Deep interiority rooted in alchemical persistence and contradictory impulses (preserve vs. release) culminates in earned surrender at the crozier snap, with embodied emotion in "cold fire of recognition."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via intensifying realizations to on-page CR closure (crozier snap reconfigures premise with 17-year cost legible in "hands empty"); oriented early, one tightening via "penny dropped" insight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ember nexus and frozen bloom constrain choices (embers need subtraction) and charge final blaze image; selective sensory details (crimson flowers, creeping frost) mirror internal shift without cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interrupt destiny) tightens via approximation failures to agency-driven snap under accumulative lens; cost felt in relic's destruction foreclosing preservation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Creative destruction emerges organically through particulars (crozier fragments ignite nexus), final image reweights surrender as fulfillment without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (alchemical metaphors like "frozen bloom"); rhythmic modulation peaks at snap without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to closure, but minor figurative density (e.g., unnamed flame colors) borders overwriting without obscuring snap beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh alchemical inversion (surrender vivifies) synthesizes relic's priestly past into transformative release, risking lyric closure that heightens stakes organically.</comment>
