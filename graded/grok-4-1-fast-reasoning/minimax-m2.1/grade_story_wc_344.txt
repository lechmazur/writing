<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thessa's motivation as lunar-eclipse locksmith intensifies credibly to the sacrificial gear placement, with embodied craft-focus and micro-choices revealing values; interiority concrete via memory cues like the chronometer vision. Minor unearned epiphany softness in "rhythm of repair pulsed through her like a second heartbeat" slightly undercuts contradiction depth at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to closure's Resonant Reconfiguration ("mirror parted like curtains of frozen light"), with legible cost in gear sacrifice; one tightening via prophecy realization narrows options purposefully. Orientation anchored early in library search; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frozen library and mirror hall constrain search/descent and charge final passage image, with selective sensory details (frosted edges, solidified mist) mirroring internal repair quest through POV bias. Environment evolves causally, guiding gear offering without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rhythm of repair via lost gears) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to agency-driven sacrifice narrowing options; cost legible in dissolving gears altering her toolkit forever, charging poise at threshold step.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of repair as sacrificial remembering emerges organically from prophecy/images to resonant CR in infinite-mirror destiny ("keeper of celestial mechanics"); avoids morals, lingers via driftwood motif shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (craft-attuned noticing: "each cog attuned to heavenly bodies"); rhythmic control modulates to charged closure image, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm/syntax, but figurative density peaks heavily in climax ("dissolve like sugar cubes in rainwater"; "curtains of frozen light") borders overwriting without obscuring closure. No loops; vivid propulsion overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith fantasy with mirror-sacrifice premise transforms tropes organically, risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens repair stakes inevitably to closure.</comment>
