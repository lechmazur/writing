<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in particular silences (e.g., "432 hertz" descending into earth); pacifist motivation compels patient tuning over neighbors' force, earning realization without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences builds to clasp's "single note" amid fireworks roar, delivering on-page CR (deeper catalog understanding post-near-loss) with legible cost in patient listening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Workshop, resonator, and clasp constrain choices (tuning vs. prying) and charge final image (moth wings open); sensory hierarchy narrows to "pyrotechnic roar" piercing quiet, mirroring internal suspension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (non-violent access) tightens via fireworks interruption enabling note; agency in resonator adjustments forecloses force path with patience cost, though external pressure mostly off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Empathy path emerges organically from silence varieties to final entry ("silence after celebration... memory of joy"); reweights premise via clasp's confession without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in close third, perceptual signature biased to frequencies/pitches; rhythmic modulation builds to "clicks open," teaching pattern without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (e.g., firework explosion punctuates note); minor overwriting in silence catalog metaphors slightly blurs peak but pattern holds through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifism, silence frequencies, and vibration-unlocking transforms quiet-stakes trope; risk in lyric accumulation inevitable at "moth's wings clicked open."</comment>
