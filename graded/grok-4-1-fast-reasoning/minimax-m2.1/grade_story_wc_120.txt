<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via nautilus tracing and memory mapping, but slips into diagnostic labels like "temporal displacement syndrome" abstract conflicting impulses; final writing earns endurance with felt cost of exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from spire setup to dawn CR closure; spire dissolution and "last of her strength" deliver legible conceptual cost reweighting homesickness, with orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spire's transparency and frozen lake's inversion constrain perception and charge final merger; sensory selectivity (frost curling ink) mirrors internal urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of final prophecy tightens via memory-mapping cadence shift under accumulative lens; dawn forces renunciation of further life with visible exhaustion cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of belonging through unheard symphonies emerges organically from nautilus spiral and fortune image; final "infinite reflected hush" reweights premise without moralizing, though fortune line borders direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias toward temporal synesthesia (ginger-snow merge); rhythmic modulation peaks at dawn without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density in image-packed lines like "gold bleeding into silver" propels without loops; minor metaphor density in peak mapping beat coherent and pattern-taught, passing ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Chronologically homesick" and ink-from-memories premise synthesize fresh fantasy lyricism; spire dissolution risks bold structural dissolve, heightening closure stakes organically.</comment>
