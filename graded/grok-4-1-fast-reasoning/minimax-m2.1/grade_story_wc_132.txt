<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between scientific detachment and personal resistance act vividly in observing vines versus placing the leaf; final call to Sarah earns renunciation of control with embodied cost in shaking hands and oblique admissions. Interiority particular and flawed without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations densify to Charged Poise closure in phone call and vine image, reweighting resistance with cost of surrender; orientation anchored early at trellis, lens unambiguous at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mossy trellis post-rain constrains observation of new vine growth, charging final image and mirroring internal shift; sensory details (wet earth perfume, dripping wood) selective via Vera's priorities, vivid without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resisting change tightens via vine discovery narrowing denial options; agency in releasing leaf forecloses control path with felt vulnerability cost in call, legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically from vine/leaf particulars reweighting self-denial premise; final image of tendrils reaching sky offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in plant-veined observations and rhythmic modulation builds to compressed release at trellis; stable close third-person limited, no head-hopping, elision of backstory paid off in call.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image-packed sentences; no loops or artifacts dull closure—vine tendrils line integrates action, motif, propulsion cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nursery life as reluctant metamorphosis lens transforms aging trope; risk in lyric Accumulative drive heightens stakes via charged plant metaphors without gimmick.</comment>
