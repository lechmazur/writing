<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied guilt (ache in chest, hands tremble, ribs pressed) roots motivation in consistent traits, with final remembrance earned via sifting micro-choices; minor slips in alternating summaries of internal conflict prevent higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through repeated sifting to Conceptual Repricing at watch hand discovery, with legible cost (heavy palm, infinite sorrow); single tightening suffices, orientation anchored early on terrace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Driftwood carvings constrain search choices throughout, while cobalt terrace and dying light charge final image; selective sensory filter (bleeding light matching ache) mirrors internal state purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover buried truth) signaled early and deepens accumulatively to personal realization, narrowing options with legible emotional cost in final image; agency via persistent sifting shows endurance under guilt pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of unmanufacturable memories emerges organically from false genealogies and watch hand reprise, offering resonant CR without moralizing; final image reweights premise via survived truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature (guilt-warped noticing of carvings); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, compression purposeful and legible to charged poise closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("weight of unspoken words" twice verbatim, "quelled" churn across beats) and repetitive guilt stems dull propulsion in high-density reflective beats; rhythm varies but overwriting artifacts pervade, touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of black-market genealogist sifting symbolic driftwood transforms memory trope via specific professional irony; watch hand turn feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
