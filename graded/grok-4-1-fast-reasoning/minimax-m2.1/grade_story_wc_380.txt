<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation intensifies convincingly from exhumation backstory to chamber descent, with embodied pull at her chest; internal conflict subtle in balancing keeper role with personal grief. Final realization earned via flower-crystal linkage but leans epiphanic without sharper contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from beach to densest pocket; CR closure in "She was the lantern lighter of forgotten things" reconfigures identity with conceptual cost of eternal duty. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via coffee-path suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Salt crystals and gravity pockets constrain path and charge final image, mirroring internal loss; sensory selection (echoing footsteps, physical silence) purposeful and POV-filtered. Micro-setting of massive crystal evolves causally with descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate mother's memory) signaled early and deepens accumulatively via gravitational pull narrowing path; agency in yielding to currents forecloses prior ignorance with felt weight. Cost legible in pulsing flowers at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory's persistence emerges organically from spilling fragments to final keeper-role reconfiguration; resonant CR answer in "time to let the light in" reweights deletion premise without moralizing. Wildflowers motif shifts from grave-map to maternal hand.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (patterns in grounds/crystals); rhythmic prose modulates from reflective to charged poise. Voice specificity in "lantern lighter of forgotten things" fuses occupational idiom with revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (salt from tears/grief); minor repetition of "gleaming silence" taught as motif without obscuring propulsion. Rhythmic variety supports descent's intensification, no major loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of whale-spilled memories, gravity pockets, and coffee divination transforms forgetting trope; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable CR hindsight. No derivative echoes; conceptual integrity unwavering.</comment>
