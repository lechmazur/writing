<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's esoteric realist mind drives concrete micro-choices like urgent knotting during the gust climax, embodying contradictory precision amid chaos without stock epiphanies. Interiority feels particular through pattern-obsessed perception, earning her endurance in rebuilding. Minor flaw: reflective backstory slightly abstracts peak embodiment, but anchors present improvisation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from patient construction to gust interruption, culminating in Charged Poise RR as monarch rests 17 minutes then departs, reweighting transient histories with felt cost of endless rebuilding. Orientation anchored early in grotto. Single scene causality intact, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Grotto's ferns, pumice, and wind constrain choices—gust scatters lattice, forces improv—charging final image of gathering broken strands. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward patterns and trajectories. Micro-setting (vines, cords) tactile and lived-in, mirroring internal states without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (signal last monarch) tightens via gust pattern-break, forcing agency in rescue knot that narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in decayed vines and "build again tomorrow." Escalation protagonist-driven, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of subtle markers for overlooked histories emerges organically from vine signals and monarch rest, final image resonating as non-literal answer: patient hands refuse silence. No moralizing; ambiguity in transience lingers authentically. Recurring transients reweight premise without token motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: geometries, trajectories filter all notice. Voice rhythmic, modulating from patient catalog to urgent "moved without panic," prose syntax embodying mind under stress. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm accelerates with gust ("ripped through... snapping"), breathes in stillness; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figs. Selective overwriting purposeful (iridescent wing patterns taught early). Propulsion clear, zero artifacts dulling closure image of orange speck dissolving.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: moth-wing geometries signal monarch amid tectonic grottos, transforming preservation tropes via esoteric realism into transient honors. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes in fragile migration without gimmickry. Inevitable hindsight: gust reprise inevitable from wind patterns.</comment>
