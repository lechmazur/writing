<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via poet's heart grasping storms amid methodical work; final renunciation of single-story revolution earned by shard-touching micro-choices with embodied cost. Interiority concrete and particular, no unearned epiphanies. Blind spots from past drive reflection that tilts present expertise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from routine to storm vision as CR, reweighting history premise with cost of traded revolutions legible in "She covered the final mirror." Orientation anchored early in corridors and visible time; no shards or transitions violate single-scene default. Persistent mirror constraint shapes tactics to charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Recurring mirrors and shard constrain choices (covering prevents madness) and charge final image; visible time as "amber honey" filters through POV urgency. Sensory hierarchy narrows to tactility in storm. Baroque asteroid's crystalline walls evolve to dissipate energy, mirroring internal smoothing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safeguard past amid dispute) signaled early, tightens via storm's density increase forcing vision that forecloses explorer myth with dispute's refugee truth. Agency in covering alters tactics; cost felt in potential overlaps and personal grief smoothing. Lens escalation reweights multiplicity over singularity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of civilization "both, as all" offers resonant non-literal answer to truth's complexity, recharging shard and revolution motifs without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from dispute vision and mirror method. No tidy binaries; embraces baroque multiplicity with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (time as "invisible river," "amber honey") biased to poet's priorities, stable single-POV distance modulates with storm intensity. Rhythmic control heightens pressure; purposeful compression taught early pays off in vision. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors consistent (sediment, shards) without muddle in peak storm beat; varied rhythm avoids loops. No scaffold, scaffolds, or artifacts; every line advances texture toward CR image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible time, mirror-storms, and vase shard transforms refugee/explorer trope into multiplicity premise; risk in baroque world logic heightens stakes inevitably. No derivatives; perspective memorable via poet-curator arc.</comment>
