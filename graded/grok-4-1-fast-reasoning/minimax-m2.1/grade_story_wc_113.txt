<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and musician-specific ("liminal hollow between audience and stage"); contradictory stay/leave impulses act in opening decision to remain; final endurance to play earned by program's causal pull with flood cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from program to water-revealed notation to playing; Charged Poise closure in "last note hung... question mark" with rising-water cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Flooded hall sensory-selective (black water pulsing with melody, lanterns flickering in rhythm); constrains choices (water reveals code, climbs to piano keys) and charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel ghost code) signaled early, tightens via water notation reveal forcing play amid rising flood; agency in performance crystallizes stance with keys-submerging cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of music transcending death emerges via particulars (damaged notation, pulsing water); final "wordless conversation complete" reconfigures disaster-to-delivery without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (intervals "wrong and right simultaneously"); rhythmic diction modulates pressure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels (e.g., "stains forming patterns... between the lines"); zero loops, coherent metaphors enhance without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Flood-revealed ghostly notation transforms ghost trope into musical code revelation; synthesis of water/ink/music feels inevitable, risks lyric closure payoff.</comment>
