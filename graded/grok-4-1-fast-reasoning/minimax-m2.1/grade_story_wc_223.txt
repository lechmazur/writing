<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via walking as archive and chessboard scars; motivation intensifies through sister's name to final release with embodied cost in luminous absence. Contradictory impulses (triage ruthlessness vs. hopeful endurance) act in scene. Minor flaw: reflective backstory slightly abstracts peak embodiment before final walk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of footsteps/memories tightens to CR closure in "Mira walked the pattern for 'beginning,' and the gallery whispered it back," reweighting absence as hope with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early (Mira/gallery/interregnum). Single scene coherent, no shards/transitions needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome acoustics constrain walking patterns and charge final whisper; chessboard as micro-setting mirrors internal loss, evolving from scarred prop to waiting hope. Sensory hierarchy (acoustic footsteps over visual) reflects POV urgency. No white-room; spatial choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archive small gestures/sister's memory) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via memory density to stance crystallization in final walk/release. Agency in patterns forecloses retrieval path with felt absence cost. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interregnum gestures/absence emerges organically from footsteps/chessboard/small acts; final image reconfigures "space between endings" without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes. Protagonist arc inextricable from question of history in loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in acoustic shadows/patterns; voice modulates rhythmically from reflective to charged poise. Diction purposeful (e.g., "luminous absence"), no head-hopping/elision issues. Prose reflects stressed mind without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; propulsion aligns with accumulative builds. Minor artifacts: paraphrase loops in interregnum reflections ("old regime fell... new one had not yet decided") dull mid-momentum slightly, but closure image clear. No filter stacks or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: footsteps-as-archive in acoustic dome transforms crisis tropes via penumbra/interregnum; chessboard absence inevitable in hindsight. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivatives; particular details anchor universals.</comment>
