<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in her calligrapher traits and师傅's influence compels the pilgrimage, with interiority embodied in tactile map fragments and gold leaf cuffs. Final writing choice earns change via prior honesty tension. Minor slip: internal conflict more summarized in backstory than simultaneous impulses in discovery beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through map piecing to room discovery, with CR closure in "She wrote the words her师傅 could not speak" reweighting premise via conceptual cost of silence/bearing truth. Orientation anchors early in palm on zinc plate. One deepening suffices; cost legible in wilting and continuation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Toxic sky, dying greenhouses, succulents constrain journey choices and charge final garden image. Sensory details (cold zinc, torn edges, candlelight) filter through Mira's tactile priorities. Micro-setting of workbench/tools integrates with action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking honesty tightens via room realization under Accumulative lens, narrowing to writing renunciation with felt cost in师傅's silence. Agency in piecing/following forecloses deception tolerance. Entry to 8.8+ via visible price charging image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of honesty emerges via letters room and gold-gilded truths, with final writing offering non-literal answer reweighting "candor in small moments." No moralizing; resonance from particulars like unsent pages. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature in gold light as "small suns" stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from workbench reflection to room crystallization. Purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged closure image. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with gold leaf motif propelling via recurrence; rhythm varies read-aloud without loops. Minor overwriting in "growing upward, inward, truthful" cluster, but purposeful for texture. Propulsion clear to final garden image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-oasis honesty archive transforms trope via calligrapher's tactile truth; risk in lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmick. Inevitable in hindsight from plate to room reconfiguration.</comment>
