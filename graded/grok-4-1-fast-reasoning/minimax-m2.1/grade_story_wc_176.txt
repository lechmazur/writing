<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in guilt "like a stone in her chest" versus forging acceptance through action; final endurance of isolation with aching joints earns closure change via prior micro-choices like numb-fingered weaving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to rope's hum as Resonant Reconfiguration; cost legible in "joints aching" and return to fled world, orientation anchored early in sanctum scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Internal stake of grief-to-remembrance tightens accumulatively via patient weaving narrowing isolation options; agency in deliberate braiding forces trade-off with bodily cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of forged remembrance emerges via particulars like punched card guiding braids; final humming rope reweights forgiveness premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in "infinite patience... reconfigure the braids"; varied syntax avoids loops, minor figurative density purposeful without muddling closure hum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of punched card encoding rope transforms memory trope; risk in lyric reconfiguration heightens stakes organically to humming archive.</comment>
