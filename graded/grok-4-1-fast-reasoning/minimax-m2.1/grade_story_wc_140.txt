<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Nameless one's motivation to map fragments into texture feels rooted in survival post-erasure, with embodied endurance in collecting; internal conflict emerges subtly in recognizing impossibility yet persisting. Lacks on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning reflective over pressurized micro-choices. Final endurance of continuation earned but without pivotal scene-testing mistake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from early fragment-collection to closure CR via label's repricing as survival evidence, with undeniable conceptual cost of erasure vs. persistence. Orientation anchored by para 2 (containers, tides, port). No shards exceed scope; cadence shift at "tucked the softened paper" reconfigures history-building.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Towering containers and tides constrain collecting and mirror internal layering, evolving causally (tide exposes label). Sensory hierarchy (water's breathing, rust, salt-preserved paper) filters through nameless perceptual bias. Final image of labyrinth movement charges closure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of textural history vs. official erasure signaled early, escalates via label discovery and dockworker fragment deepening stake to choice-of-continuation. Density increase reweights under lens; endurance forecloses erasure path with felt survival cost. Minor abstractness in pressure tests keeps from 9.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Erased histories emerge from particulars (death certificate, label, fragments) without statement, resonating in final CR where survival layers reweight premise. Ambiguity lingers in nameless persistence vs. world's silence. No moralizing; counter-reading of forgetting possible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (rhythm/rust, overheard detritus) stable in single POV, modulating rhythmically with tides/emotion. Purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at closure. No head-hopping; inference matches nameless limits.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring tides; no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("rusted skyscrapers") purposeful for texture, not muddling peaks. Read-aloud rhythm natural, closure line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh lyric synthesis of port detritus as memory-texture transforms erasure trope via fragment currency and nameless survival. Bold accumulative design risks abstraction but heightens stakes coherently. Irreplaceable port-labyrinth angle inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
