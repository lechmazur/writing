<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marek's motivation to learn belonging is embodied through the warming feather and patient waiting, with internal conflict in inherited searching yielding earned kinship at the firefly emergence; micro-choices like placing the feather reveal values under time pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry to archive note resonance, culminating in Charged Poise RR at firefly ascension with legible cost (imminent flooding foreclosing isolation); orientation anchored early via feather and facility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystalline towers, bioluminescent strands, and glass dome constrain choices (flood deadline) and charge final firefly image against stars; sensory selectivity (brine crust, copper air) mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging's rhythm) signaled early and deepens via note and feather pulse, with time pressure (sunrise) forcing endurance; final cadence shift reweights isolation into shared breath under Accumulative lens, cost felt in patient wait.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of shared wonder emerges organically from firefly-note-feather particulars, final image resonating as non-literal answer (belonging as breath witnessed together) without moralizing or platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (rhythmic lights, pulsing objects) stable in single POV; diction modulates from exploratory to crystalline poise at "boundaries...blur into something like kinship."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (e.g., "trembling lift of green-gold light"); coherent metaphors (fever dream reverse, cathedral breath) propel without loops or overwriting in peak firefly beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underwater firefly observatory and landscape astrologer transforms belonging trope into inevitable shadow-light rhythm; risk in lyric accumulation heightens resonant closure.</comment>
