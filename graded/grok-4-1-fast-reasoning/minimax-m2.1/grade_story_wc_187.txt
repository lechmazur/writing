<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied nostalgia shown in "preemptively nostalgic, as all true archivists must be"; micro-choices like stopping at the shadow-cut monument earn identity shift. Minor slip in occasional diagnostic phrasing like "this was not weakness but method" borders therapy-speak without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from storm pulse to deepening hush; orientation anchored early in forecourt after rain. Charged Poise closure in final writing moment reconfigures identity with felt erosion cost, legible in "boundaries...dissolved entirely."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting vivid and purposeful: solid fog as "bridge between...world and...memory" constrains her craft, shadows guide choices, crystals charge final whisper image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (resonances over visuals); above-clouds scale clarifies stakes without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witnessing memory before erosion) deepens texturally via shadow examination tightening to personal identity reconfiguration. Agency in conjectural reading forecloses inherited-self path with vulnerability cost, felt in "vulnerable to erosion."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of identity as "continuous act of creation" emerges organically from monument shadows and final writing; resonant answer in monuments' "love...presence" reweights ordinary instants without moralizing. Subtext in grief-performed vs processed enriches ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature (shadow angles as "surgical precision"); syntax/rhythm modulate from storm pulse to hush poise. Stable close-POV filters all through archivist's attuned noticing, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulation without loops; metaphors consistent in voice (sky as "wound") avoid muddle. Minor scaffold in adjacent nostalgia paraphrases ("loss for experiences...mourning memories") subtracts slightly, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-archivist in tactile fog/monuments transforms trope via shadow-conjecture; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in final dissolution image.</comment>
