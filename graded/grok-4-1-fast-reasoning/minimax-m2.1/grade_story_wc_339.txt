<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied familiarity with death ("she and Mortality; she didn't fear him, and he didn't rush her"), rooting motivation in career ache; micro-choices like precise sub guidance reveal analytic endurance under pressure. Final resolve to deliver message earns change with felt cost of potential self-letting-go. Minor abstract slips in emotion embodiment prevent 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from descent to globe/note discovery, culminating in CR closure ("perhaps, she would finally understand how to let go of the ocean herself") with undeniable conceptual cost reweighting her ocean bond. One tightening via note reveal narrows interpretive options. Orientation anchors early; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via "manipulator arm" handling and "wreckage had its own architecture"; snow globe as micro-setting charges final image ("snow... finding their rest around the tiny windmill"). Sensory selection (fluttering pages, swirling snow) reflects analytic POV bias. Purposeful, vivid integration throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grasp letting go's physics) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through globe/note to Charged Poise at end with foreclosed attachment cost. Agency in solo descent/handling drives under lens; one reversal via note tightens internal pressure. Low external conflict fits length/scope but limits peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of loss-as-transition emerges organically from shipwreck preservation and note ("The light doesn't die. It transforms"), reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Subtext in entrusted ocean delivery invites ambiguity on Miriam's arc. Note's directness borders echo but integrates via CR.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature ("deep had become... second language"; "wreckage had its own architecture") modulates rhythmically under reflective pressure. Stable single-POV distance biases toward analytic intimacy; purposeful compression legible and pattern-taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "snow... suspended thoughts" advances setting/action/atmosphere); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, no loops/artifacts. Minor elevated diction ("physics of letting go") fits voice but risks register drift in peaks. Zero figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Snow globe/note in sunken library transforms lost-ship trope via preservation physics and transmission trust; fresh synthesis of Earhart/Montserrat backstories heightens stakes organically. Risky solo-deep dive and Mortality personification feel inevitable to CR closure.</comment>
