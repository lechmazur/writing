<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between logical training and visceral terror drives micro-choices like fractional key adjustments, earning the endurance at climax; embodied emotions peak in "slumped against the lighthouse wall, exhaustion and relief flooding." Minor label-speak ("logically emotional") slightly abstracts without cost in pivotal tuning beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore: threat awakens (because), real-time tuning narrows options (therefore), DC closure in "wave of sonic absolution rippled outward" with legible cost in exhaustion; orientation anchored immediately in ice marina and lighthouse; single scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina and lighthouse foundation constrain ascent and tuning; sensory dominance of sound (groan, hum, jagged tone) reflects urgency and POV expertise, charging final "drifts... slow dance"; sunset evolution mirrors pressure without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stabilize crystal before maelstrom) signaled early, escalates causally via warping tone and shuddering ice forcing iterative adaptations; climax agency in precise tuning forecloses failure with exhaustion cost; one tightening sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of logic-feeling synthesis emerges organically through tuning hands guided by "logical training... heart," reweighted in final guardian image without moralizing; resonance from particulars like key legacy avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in frequency/math bias; rhythmic modulation accelerates in tuning ("fractions of millimeters"); no dialogue, but diction texture fits embodied crisis without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "sunset flames burned lower... ice shuddered"); varied rhythm propels climax without loops or muddled metaphors; minor overwriting in "molten gold... bruising sky" contained pre-pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic engineering fantasy in ice-bound marina transforms tropes via vibrational math and legacy key; risk in real-time tuning ingenuity heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
