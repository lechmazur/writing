<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Spatially gifted trait yields concrete, embodied perceptions of relational geometry, earning the final realization of deliberate separation as intimacy; secondary characters apply pressure through approach and statement without muddling POV. Minor abstractness in interior epiphanies ("physics of letting go") avoids full 9+ contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via intensifying perceptual density to Charged Poise closure ("quiet wildfire spreading... illuminating the hidden mycelium") with legible relational cost in the voice crack and honored boundaries; single scene anchors orientation early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent farm glow actively reveals/permeates boundaries, constraining Mira's perceptions and charging the triangle image; sensory details (pulsing light, vibrations) mirror internal states purposefully without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discerning connection amid leaving tightens accumulatively through approach, pause, and statement, forcing stance crystallization; cost felt in foreclosed proximity, visible in unmoved triangle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of intimacy-through-separation emerges organically via mycelial metaphors and final CR image reweighting prior barriers as love; resonant without moralizing, though some phrasing borders overt ("most careful kind of love").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with spatial perceptual signature stable in single POV; man's dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishing from murmurs; rhythm modulates to charged closure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dense, rhythmic prose propels via varied syntax, but paraphrase loops on "boundaries/membranes/permeable" (e.g., repeated in realization beat) dull peak density by −0.9; no closure harm, metaphors cohere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of intrusion detection, mycology, and spatial perception transforms "letting go" into revolutionary architecture; risk in quiet lyric closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
