<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when organ transfixes her ("unable to continue forward... speak directly to something buried"), compelling rebellion that earns fear's reconfiguration at closure; embodied panic and stubborn will feel particular and flawed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density tightens from narrowing tunnels to nexus shimmer, landing Charged Poise closure where tunnels shift to "passages of possibility" with legible emotional cost of grandfather's legacy; orientation anchored by ~100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shimmering nexus geometry constrains alcove discovery and charges final image of transformed tunnels; sensory hierarchy (cold stone touch, organ echo) reflects claustrophobic urgency without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (key amid fear) deepens accumulatively via organ paralysis reversal, forcing endurance with visible cost in trembling hands claiming key; agency peaks in "rebellion against the silence."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rebellion against forgetting emerges implicitly from organ beacon and key weight, final image reweighting tunnels as "defiance against the darkness" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with claustrophobic perceptual signature ("weight of stone... personal affront"); rhythmic modulation heightens under stress, elisions purposeful for mystery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but minor overwriting in nexus ("wound in the stone, its walls shimmering with... origami made of shadow") slightly muddles peak without touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny transforms explorer trope via organ-guided nexus geometry, synthesizing fear-conquest with impossible space for fresh inevitability.</comment>
