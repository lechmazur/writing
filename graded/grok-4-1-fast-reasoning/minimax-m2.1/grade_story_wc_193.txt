<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's distrust from pyramid scheme survival drives contradictory pull to risk, embodied in bolt gripped "like tiny teeth"; other Maya's line forces witnessing choice with earned tears at closure, no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: glitch texts build density to farm manifestation; CR closure via bolt's glow-to-ordinary shift reweights promise premise with "weight lifted" cost legible in final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushrooms "track her movement like curious animals" constrain navigation and charge climax; bolt as micro-setting evolves tactilely, mirroring internal transformation at "glow with inner light."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform broken promises) signaled early via texts, escalates accumulatively to other Maya encounter narrowing to witness role; agency in entry forecloses distrust path with tears as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of promises-as-diamonds emerges from bolt's pressure-to-precious shift, resonant non-literal CR in "outlast the moment" without moralizing; particulars like grandmother's win recharge prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (distrust filters "beautiful lies"); voice textured, rhythmic in sensory pulses; other Maya's "crackled" dialogue distinct, subtext-laden.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, no loops; minor overwrites like "frozen waterfalls" purposeful for wonder, but "pressure met carbon" borders mixed metaphor without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quantum promise via glitch texts and mushroom bolt transforms pyramid trope into dimensional witness arc; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight, risk of other-self crystallizes stakes boldly.</comment>
