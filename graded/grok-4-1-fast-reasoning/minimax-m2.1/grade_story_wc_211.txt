<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular in sensing silence as "pressure behind her eyes"; contradictory impulses between absence and prophetic filling act in immersion beat; final archival shift earned by scribe's traits and prior causality, with embodied "velvet disquiet."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from foghorn silence to layered immersion; CR closure in hearing dead languages reweights premise with conceptual cost legible in "promises accumulated like sediment"; orientation anchored by ~50 words, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rooftop orchard constrains immersion via roots/isolation, charges final image with stirring trees and sentinel tower; sensory hierarchy (salt wind, city lights) reflects scribe's priorities; body/tool (wax to temple) as micro-setting shapes climax choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (filling silence with prophecy) signaled early, deepens via immersion density under Accumulative lens, narrowing to archival reconfiguration; agency in pressing wax forecloses ignorance with felt disquiet cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of vows enduring in silence emerges from particulars (oath tablets, wax grooves); final image of patterns settling in vault offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting foghorn gap without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in language/memory focus ("grooves of a voice"); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, diction controlled for accumulative texture without elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with lines like "slipping through the gap... pouring like amber light" advancing image/atmosphere; zero loops/artifacts, varied rhythm propels to closure; purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phonograph relic unleashing dead voices in modern silence transforms prophecy trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight via wax/grandmother causal thread.</comment>
