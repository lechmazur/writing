<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in family legacy compel the final act; chant and rag preparation reveal character under starless pressure. Minor flaw: reflective summaries slightly abstract internal conflict rather than fully dramatizing contradictory impulses in pivotal prep beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds seamlessly from arrival to spiral ascent; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with conceptual cost in "defiance made visible" and village response reconfiguring darkness. Orientation anchored early; one meaningful deepening via mosaic note tightens stakes without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blooming fortress and mosaic constrain choices (courtyard placement, heart-note cue) and charge final image; sensory details (dust, thyme, cold stone) filter through pyrotechnic POV, evolving causally to closed petals under starless sky.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pierce starless dark/hopelessness gravity) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via mosaic challenge to fire spiral; agency in controlled combustion forecloses inaction with felt risk/cost in "patient ascent despite gravity." Lacks one deeper option-narrowing turn for 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of controlled fire as resurrection emerges organically from particulars (rag knot, spiral, phoenix mosaic); final image offers resonant non-literal answer ("one small light... sky full of stars deciding to wake") reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical perceptual signature (fire filtered "through flame," chant rhythm) modulates with intensity; stable close-third POV with character-biased noticing; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in closure without head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic propulsion in spiral ascent; varied syntax supports momentum. Minor overwrite in opening metaphors ("nature's quiet rebellion," "hope itself had developed... gravity") borders mixed vehicles, dulling early propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pyrotechnics as cosmic defiance transforms tropes (dark night, phoenix) through specific rag spiral and mosaic note; risk-taking in lyric accumulative closure heightens stakes organically, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
