<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara's interiority shines in embodied dread (skin glow, clasp's cold press), with contradictory impulses—embrace water's death vs. forward movement—culminating in earned confession. Minor diagnostic edge in advisor's definitions slightly undercuts raw crisis feel, but micro-choices reveal values without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images/textures build from reservoir glow to mirror tears, yielding CR closure where photo normalizes and luminance dims as conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early (gates, funhouse); single scene with no causality breaks, pattern taught immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Funhouse constrains choices (mirrors multiply dread, weep condensation), charging final image; peeling smile, mercury luminance vivid and POV-filtered. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis to tactile/ visual immediacies without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confront inherited curse/fear) deepens accumulatively via mirror escalation to confession reversal, narrowing to renunciation with legible cost (luminance dims, dictionary abandoned). Protagonist agency drives peak; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (fear=desire's dual face) emerges organically from particulars (clasp's tear-tracks, mirror's repulsive cloak), resonant CR in grandmother's resting face reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature gothic-luminous (e.g., "liquid mercury on the glass"); rhythm modulates tension, diction biased to Clara's haunted idiom. No head-hopping; purposeful compression legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., mirrors "weeping condensation" advances atmosphere/action); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts dull closure. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors contained, voice-motivated without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cursed photos, dream dictionary paradoxes, funhouse as fear-door transforms carnival trope; risk in surreal CR (photo shift reversal) inevitable from priors, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
