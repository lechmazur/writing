<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (past fear vs. tempered obsession) act in scene via passage choice; final understanding earned by causal buildup from prior encounter. Obsession embodied in "latent blaze... tempered her into something harder."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to CR closure where palm press reconfigures knowledge ("not an ending but a beginning") with cost (inversion ending, "markings would retreat"). Orientation anchored early; pattern taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto walls/markings constrain choices (passage selection, palm press) and charge final image (glow spreads "like fire through dry paper"). Sensory hierarchy reflects prism-POV bias; inversion evolves details causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find combinations) signaled early, tightens via marking discovery/deepening realization under Accumulative lens; agency in left-passage choice forecloses paths with time-cost legibility ("inversion would end soon").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (vigilance preserves knowledge) emerges from particulars like doodles/markings; final CR reweights premise non-literally ("seeds... sprolved into bloom") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with prism-perceptual signature ("splitting every word into its spectrum"); rhythmic control modulates intensity, e.g., compression in inversion ascent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; minor overwriting in metaphors ("mist coil inward like breath held too long") purposeful for textural lens, no loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity inversion + prism-seeing transforms tropes; risk in lyric ascent/understanding feels inevitable, charged by "tower with no base" resolving.</comment>
