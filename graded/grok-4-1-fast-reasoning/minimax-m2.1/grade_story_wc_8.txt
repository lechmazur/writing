<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dr. Vance's emotionally rational trait embodies contradiction in weighing grandfather's nobility against betrayal evidence, compelling her publishing resolve with generational cost. Interiority concrete via historical parallels; micro-choice to lift letter reveals values hierarchy. 9+ test met: impulses clash in scene, final renunciation earned by prior traces of mythology construction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflections densify from station entry to letter lift, culminating in CR where truth-rescue reconfigures noble-lie premise with social cost to town/grandfather legacy. Orientation anchored para 1 (Halford Station, post-petal drop). Closure cost legible in "disturb the town that had honored her grandfather"; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivy "transforming derelict platform into...cathedral" and echoing tiles constrain reflective stasis, mirroring internal convergence; station bench cues grandfather stories that charge parallels method. Recurrent ivy/stones evolve with light fade, filtering letter view. 9+ test: setting charges final image, reweighting curated memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue truth vs noble lie) signaled para 2, tightens accumulatively via letter evidence deepening grandfather's complicity, forcing publish-or-silence trade-off. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise in satchel-open beat; cost felt in town disturbance. Minor abstractness in early ethical query slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Noble lies emerge implicitly via Caldwell betrayal layers and grandfather's "noble" burial, answered non-literally by letter-lift resolve refusing curated survival. Resonance from particulars avoids moralizing; irony in her rescue mirroring station's preserved tiles. 9+ test: ending reweights question with conceptual cost to identity mortar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with historian perceptual signature: notices acanthus borders, Gothic script amid decay. Voice texture literary-specific (e.g., "soil carried seeds"), modulates reflective rhythm to resolute cadence. No head-hopping; diction fits scholarly lexicon without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (advance reflection/action/atmosphere), varied rhythm (long introspective to crisp resolves). Minor scaffold in adjacent "noble lie" paraphrases (−0.2); no loops/artifacts touch closure. Propulsion peaks in "She would publish...refuse to let anyone...decide which parts," recharging motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: historian recaptures truth via WWII station parallels transforms noble-lie trope into generational mortar metaphor. Risk in heavy reflection pays off in CR; no derivatives, particulars (1943 letter, 1967 last train) anchor ingenuity.</comment>
