<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Embodied emotion in dance as silenced language reveals character-particular interiority; micro-choices like spiral sequence earn final endurance with cost of lost voice. Minimal contradictory impulses in scene limit 9+; steadfast defiance strong but untested mid-beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dance patterns and memories builds to RR closure in "The water began to drain," reconfiguring captivity with legible cost of "every sacrifice." Orientation anchored early in descent; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken lab's water buoys and constrains dance, spider web recurs to charge final image mirroring Mira's web of defiance. Sensory hierarchy (silence, pressure) reflects POV urgency; evolves causally to dry corridor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-liberation signaled early tightens via dance sequence narrowing to spiral, forcing metal groan and drain under Accumulative lens. Agency in choreography forecloses compliance path; cost felt in "apparent compliance."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted vulnerability emerges organically from journal/dance/dice particulars; final spider image offers resonant CR repricing silence as strength without statement. Complexity in regime's miscalculation lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in close third, perceptual signature biases toward algorithmic arcs and melodies; rhythmic syntax modulates with dance intensity. No head-hopping; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels Accumulative build; figurative language (e.g., "hangman's dice" evolution) coherent without muddle. Minor density in opening metaphors doesn't touch closure; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dance-as-decryption synthesizes code-breaking tropes into fresh bodily escape; spider reprise risks bold lyric payoff heightening stakes organically. Inevitable in hindsight from journal rigging.</comment>
