<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in Varn's philosophy, with mechanical arm embodying past struggle and present advantage; contradictory grace vs. intensity shown in duel. Minor slip in overt telling of traits like "diplomatically fierce" without deeper embodied cost at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: wait → arrival → escalating duel → redirection victory as DC/RR with legible cost in opponent's lowered certainty; single scene oriented early via atrium/brook.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (gleaming arm, sparks, shadows) filtered through Varn's priorities; half-painted sundial charges final image by shifting to reveal patterns at breakthrough.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proof as truth schism) tightens via philosophical breakthrough turning momentum; agency in precise arm movement forecloses opponent's doctrine with felt defeat cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of conflict-to-illumination emerges organically from duel particulars, resonating in final mutual recognition; minor overt philosophizing ("questions into destinations") borders thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct philosophical texture modulating to fluid precision in duel; perceptual signature in transforming limitation to asset feels character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Good rhythmic variety and density, but minor paraphrase loops on brook murmur and Varn's philosophy ("understood that," "transform") dull mid-duel propulsion; no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fencing-as-debate with mechanical arm converting duel to asset; risk-taking in metaphorical escalation feels inevitable at "turned the younger scholar's momentum back upon itself."</comment>
