<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to protect the impossible cargo roots consistently in her guard role, intensifying through staff-grasp and defiant dialogue; embodied reactions like pausing at the jolt reveal pressure. Merchant as secondary applies relevant opposition, forcing stance via quote exchange. Limited on-page contradictory impulses prevent 9+, but endurance earns closure without unmotivated leap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds from dune walk to merchant fold, tightening via jolts and quotes to Charged Poise closure where "understanding passing...collapsing into kindness" reconfigures threat into kinship with conceptual cost of shared loss. Orientation anchors early (Mira on dune with cart); single scene coherent. Final dune image as CR pays off disorientation waiver, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glowing dune moss constrains (wheel-root jolt) and charges final "phosphorescent note" image, mirroring internal resolve amid ash-gray decay; sensory bias (blue light as sea memories) filters through Mira's priorities. Details evolve causally (bloom colonizes darkness), vivid yet economical. Recurrent archive hum grounds spatial choreography cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cargo delivery) signals early, tightens accumulatively via merchant threat narrowing to "they aren't getting either," forcing verbal endurance with felt relational cost in fractured smile. Protagonist agency in replies and continuation forecloses theft path; one deepening suffices. Minor abstractness in stakes scale slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hope as pause amid loss emerges organically from clock midnight (fire tip-point) to sparks-cultivation retort, resonating in final dune-mending image reweighting decay into possibility without moral state. Subtext in merchant grief-grin and quote exchange invites ambiguity on world's mendability. No tidy binaries; counter-reading (irrevocable burn) lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (biolum as "scattered memories," probabilities "relaxed") biases via Mira's quantum-charm lens; dialogue subtextual ("sparks" counters quote) distinguishes voices idiomatically. Rhythmic modulation peaks in exchange brevity, eliding without withholding; no head-hop. Prose texture as mind under trek-stress consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "wheel hit root...held its breath" advances action/atmo/foreshadow); no loops, metaphors coherent (archive "ink in possibilities," smile "fractured"). Rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion syncs scene (short jolts, breathing dialogue). Zero scaffold or muddle touches closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Post-forest quantum-freight premise synthesizes fresh via wave-charm probability smiles and midnight-clock fire-pause, transforming tropes through lived trek details; merchant fold-risk crystallizes organically. Bold lyric poise on decay-mend heightens stakes without gimmick; inevitable hindsight from archive-seed to sparks-payoff.</comment>
