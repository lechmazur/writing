<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied emotion in "settled into her chest with quiet weight"; micro-choices like retrieving the nest reveal values under reflective pressure. Final realization earned by prior letter-weaving causality, foreclosing isolation with conceptual cost of exposure. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds to CR closure in final paragraph's "weaver of connection," reweighting premise with undeniable conceptual cost of public exposure. Orientation anchored early in temple walk; single scene coherent. Persistent nest constraint shapes tactics to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "wet stone and something greener beneath" filter through Mira's priorities, mirroring internal states via pond ripples. Nest as recurring micro-setting constrains realization choice and charges closure. Environment evolves causally post-rain, guiding action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unspoken connection signaled early, tightens accumulatively via nest discovery narrowing to installation epiphany, forcing renunciation of secrecy with felt public cost. Agency in planning first letters forecloses private hoarding. One decisive deepening suffices; minor abstractness in question prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of spiraling connection emerges organically from letters-nest-installation particulars, final image resonantly reweighting without moralizing: "thread that connected all things stretching from her hands." Subtext in exposed confessions invites ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature in spiral-noticing bias; rhythmic prose modulates lyrically to intensify realization. No head-hopping or elision issues; diction controlled and voice-motivated. Syntax reflects contemplative mind without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies naturally, propelling from rain to stars without loops or scaffolds. Figuratives like "Nautilus curve" purposeful and coherent, no muddle in peak realization beat. Zero artifacts; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostwriter secrets into nest-installation transforms tropes via spiral motif grown from particulars. Risky lyric reflection heightens stakes coherently; premise commits to whimsical exposure without retreat. Hindsight inevitability in thread realization.</comment>
