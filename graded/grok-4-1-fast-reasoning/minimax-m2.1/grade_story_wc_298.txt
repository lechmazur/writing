<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—aching to fill soul-holes yet feeling memory-loss weight—act in scene via resolve carrying her deeper, earning the final wholeness realization with visible cost; no unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing. Blind spots in idealizing bargain drive the pivotal transference understanding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via root patterns and card warming to CR closure: "the transaction had made her more whole," reweighting premise with undeniable cost in "burned-out spaces where joy used to live." Orientation anchored early at palm on wall; one meaningful deepening at golden tree pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Roots snaking through bones constrain navigation and mirror internal barter, charging closure image of sister woven into orchard; sensory hierarchy (pulse through fingertips, warm card) reflects grief urgency, vivid and purposeful without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (soul-patching via sister-transfer) signaled early, deepens accumulatively at apparition confrontation narrowing resurrection illusion to transference trade-off; agency in dropping card forecloses path with legible memory cost charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of loss inlaid as growth emerges organically via root/bone motifs shifting from violation to communion, culminating in resonant non-literal answer: "some holes could not be patched—only honored," reweighting bargain without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (shadows "like living things," roots' "intimacy"); rhythmic control modulates from dusky corridors to charged poise at "fierce gentleness," no leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated imagery ("burnt paper flowers," roots "weaving through ribcages"); varied rhythm breathes with scene, zero loops or scaffolds, purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle even in peak orchard reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms grief/resurrection tropes into fresh catacomb orchard barter calculus, with roots-bones synthesis feeling inevitable; bold lyric accumulation heightens stakes via impossible trees constraining choices.</comment>
