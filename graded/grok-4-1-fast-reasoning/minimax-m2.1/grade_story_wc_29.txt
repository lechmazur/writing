<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particularized through embodied focus ("ethereal grit... like a second skeleton") and cautious hope constraining aggressive adjustments; contradictory impulses in precise calculations balancing hope against equipment risk earn final endurance. Blind spots in tricksters' age add struggle without convenience. Final stance reconfiguration paid by night's toil, visible in cold coffee and chart margins.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: observation (subsonics) → realization (charts) → calculation → counter-broadcast DC with cost (precision risk). Orientation anchors early (booth, protests). Single tightening via interference reversal narrows options, closure charged by community softening and her poised readiness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Station console, headphones, charts constrain choices (adjustments, calculations); sensory hierarchy (humming equipment, bleeding chants, trembling charts) narrows under crisis. Body as micro-setting in pressing headphones, pencil scratches. Final chart return charges closure image under causal lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (disrupt subsonics) signaled early, tightens causally through calculations risking damage; agency in broadcast forecloses persistence path. Cost legible in toil ("worked through the night") altering tactics. Minor abstractness in tricksters' motives slightly mutes peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of counter-manipulation emerges via particulars (frequencies sowing discord → counter-pattern); final image (charts ordered, silence ringing) non-literally reweights cosmic interference premise with human resilience cost. Subtext in amplification of natural tensions avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (harmonic resonances, whispers weaponized); rhythmic modulation accelerates in calculations ("pencil scratching"). No dialogue; diction biased to interpreter's cosmic attunement without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; no loops, but minor overwriting in "cosmic tricksters" refrain slightly drifts register in peak broadcast beat. Propulsion strong, metaphors coherent (seeds on ground, second skeleton). Closure image clear without artifacts.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: subsonic cosmic manipulation via campus radio transformed through interpreter's charts and counter-frequencies; risk in precise reversal heightens ingenuity without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from harmonic premise.</comment>
