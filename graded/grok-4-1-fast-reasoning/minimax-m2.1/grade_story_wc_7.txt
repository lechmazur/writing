<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines in chef's hands "remembering the language of pruning," tying gift to motivation; earned change via seed-tasting forecloses commodified path with felt cost of carrying flame. Minor backstory summary early slightly abstracts conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensory build to alignment peak delivers CR closure in "seed now dissolved... part of her own synaptic landscape," reweighting rebellion premise with undeniable personal cost. Orientation anchors immediately at door; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains via "rusted... weeping orange tears" and "withered garden," mirroring internal ruins-to-beauty; final transformation charges image, fulfilling 9+ test. Sensory filter (tasting plant histories) selective and POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (embody seed's wisdom vs erasure/commodification) signaled early via pull, deepens accumulatively to tasting/pruning agency that forecloses prior life path. Cost legible in "refusal to let her gift be commodified"; one tightening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rebellion theme emerges organically from seed survival and pruning, resonating in final kitchen image without overt moral; last line's "soup spoons and pruning shears" borders echo but integrates as voice. Complexity lingers in stubborn persistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with synesthetic perceptual signature ("taste memories... flavors she had only ever tasted in dreams"); rhythmic diction modulates to peak intensity without elision issues. Distinct texture elevates under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel via sensory propulsion; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures in peak tasting beat. Propulsion peaks cleanly in "worlds exploded across her consciousness."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synesthetic chef + knowledge seed premise synthesizes fresh angle on oral wisdom vs institutional erasure; risk in accumulative tasting arc inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via ruin-cultivation.</comment>
