<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's interiority embodied in tree climbs and tears during forgiveness; contradictory peace-with-hollowness drives micro-choices like repeated ascents. Final realization earned via prior causality of tending and mercy. Minor slip: abstract "forgiveness was not a gift to the offender" borders diagnostic without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from forgiveness reflection to scallop-pattern notice to peak climb realization. Orientation anchored early in grotto/garden. Closure as CR reweights cycle premise with conceptual cost in final tending image; hairpin/tree constrain final poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ash tree and cloud-sea constrain climbs for clarity, charging final descent/golden light image. Sensory mist/vines selective via caretaker bias. Umbral grotto micro-setting evolves with light break, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contentment source) signaled post-forgiveness; tightening via scallop notice narrows to highest climb under Accumulative lens. Agency in ascents forecloses completion-seeking path with ongoing-tending cost felt in final hand-on-leaves. Escalation coherent via density, not multi-reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of cycle-as-contentment emerges from tending/forgiveness particulars, reweighting via CR without statement. Final hairpin-gleam image non-literal answer to hollowness. Resists tidy moral; ambiguity in "purpose continuing" lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with lyrical perceptual signature (mist-drinking vines, wind-lullaby). Rhythm modulates from descriptive calm to hushed realization. No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "clouds passing beneath her feet" advances setting/embodiment/escalation). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative purposeful (gray sea, vineyard hush). Propulsion peaks clean in final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: liminal grotto + hairpin/scallop motif transforms forgiveness/cycle tropes into textured realization. Risky lyric ascent structure heightens stakes organically. No close echoes; particular mist-garden anchors universal presence.</comment>
