<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Claustrophobia embodied concretely from "tightening her chest" through final choice, with contradictory impulses (flee vs. loyalty) acting simultaneously; earned renunciation of return path with dissolution cost; minor abstract interiority in Elara's voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with sensory deepening to CR closure ("She made her choice... ocean... library"); orientation anchored early; single tightening via fleck touch shifts perception/options with legible cost of boundary dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Facility, cables, tides constrain entry/urgency and charge final image (ocean as library); sensory hierarchy (claustrophobic narrowing to bioluminescent pulses) reflects POV; micro-setting (codex/flecks) guides pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve vs. stay) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through revelations narrowing options; agency in hand-on-codex forecloses return with felt cost; one tightening sufficient, pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cables as memory emerges organically from particulars, reweighted by CR ending image (guardians of hush); resonant non-literal answer to connection/invisibility without moralizing; Elara's voice integrates subtext via prior setup.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (claustrophobic bias in spatial dread); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates intensity purposefully; no dialogue, but internal voice coherent and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion syncing tension (short sentences in revelation); minor repetition ("pulsed") purposeful for cables; no loops/artifacts dulling closure; rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cables as ghosted voices/memory transforms trope; risk in consciousness dissolution heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from early Elara obsession.</comment>
