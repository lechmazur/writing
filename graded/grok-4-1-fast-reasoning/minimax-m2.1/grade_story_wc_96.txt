<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority in tin as "second heart" and sharing private poems earn the relational shift; Delphine's pianist confession mirrors Mira's condition, forcing micro-choices under institutional pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through revelation density to Charged Poise closure; final image of "luminous and incomplete" library reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost of fragility against "indifferent stars."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rusted beams and moonlight constrain open-air intimacy and charge final "fractured light"; selective sensory filter (silver glow, soft exhales) mirrors internal blooming without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of forging meaning tightens via deepening revelations (personalities, hands remembering); poem read aloud forces stance crystallization with felt relational cost under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resistance emerges implicitly from joint creation; final cathedral image offers non-literal answer to anarchy, reweighting particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias in noticing Delphine's "precise" fingers; dialogue subtextual ("books remembered") advances stakes naturally, distinct voices intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric rhythm; no loops, varied syntax propels to closure, minor overwriting in metaphors like "architects of something small but whole" fits taught poetic texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of molting poet/pianist forging "small cathedral" in prison transforms tropes; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars without gimmickry.</comment>
