<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory abilities root motivation consistently, intensifying via fossil interaction to compel purpose realization. Interiority particular through heat-mapping embodiment, avoiding stock phrasing. Final change earned by prior mapping causality, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to CR closure in "She had found her voice" line, reweighting documentation to voicing with conceptual transition cost. Orientation anchored early in cave/algae/Sleep. Single scene tightens meaningfully via fossil float.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elm leaf fossil as micro-setting constrains realization choice and charges final image, per 9+ test. Sensory details (algae pulse, heat residues, saltwater float) selective, POV-biased, integrated into action. Atmosphere tensions post-Sleep transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping anomalies for purpose) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through fossil emotion density to stance crystallization. Float agency forecloses passive role with felt transition cost. Minor abstractness in stakes prevents 9+ agency drive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of voicing transformed world emerges organically from sensory particulars and fossil image shift, resonant non-literal answer in final permanence line. Subtext in emotional residues avoids moralizing. Complexity lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with sensory perceptual signature; diction/rhythm modulate from exploratory to revelatory. Prose texture distinct in heat/emotion phrasing. No head-hopping; elision of Sleep details paid off in purpose reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety; metaphors coherent (e.g., "photographs made of warmth"). Minor repetitive "heat signatures" phrasing in mid-section, but purposeful for accumulative texture, not loop. Propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-hibernation sensory cartography and impossible fossil transforms tropes organically. Elm anomaly turn inevitable from world rules. Bold conceptual risk in "factually mystical" reweights premise without gimmick.</comment>
