<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to renegotiate entry roots in her linguistic expertise and intensifies via discoveries, with internal shift from adequacy to inadequacy shown in scene. Contradictory impulses emerge when methods feel inadequate against absences, but embodied emotions remain conceptual rather than visceral. Final realization at "the rescue mission was not to save knowledge... but to rescue humanity" feels earned by prior causality without strong micro-choices under acute pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of discoveries builds from shifted geography to fragments and gaps, culminating in CR closure ("she understood... rescue humanity from its fear") with conceptual cost of confronting forgotten knowledge. Orientation anchors early (Elara descending ramp three days post-time traveler). Single continuous scene with legible progression; no shard violations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Labyrinthine shelves, empty gaps, nautilus chamber constrain choices (tracing spines, investigating omissions) and charge final image (passages narrowing to doorway). Sensory hierarchy via POV: linguistic "vibration of accumulated words," "unheard symphony" motif mirrors internal states through action. Specificity purposeful, no white-room; mountain's sigh evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renegotiate via gaps) signaled early, tightens accumulatively when fragments reveal failed bargain, deepening to diary translation narrowing options. Agency in investigating/understanding forecloses prior inadequacy with conceptual cost felt at "courage to encounter what has been forgotten." Escalation coherent under lens, pressure from shifting geography forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge in absences/loss emerges organically from gaps, flowers as unlearned lessons, time traveler's rejection; final CR reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in "places where knowledge had been removed to prevent certain kinds of rescue" invites ambiguity on understanding's fear. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: botanical/linguistic lens filters "each pressed flower... a word in a language older than alphabets." Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, diction purposeful (e.g., "unheard symphony" motif). No dialogue or head-hopping; compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action/thought (e.g., "traced her fingers along spines... approached them with the reverence of a surgeon"); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language dense but pattern-taught ("symphony," "ice cracks") without muddle in closure beat. Minor register elevation consistent with voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes linguistics, botany, infinite library of unlearned lessons into fresh angle on knowledge/fear; "botanical diary" transforms trope via absences. Risk in poetic accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight at crystalline resolution. No derivatives; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
