<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's grief anchors motivation, with contradictory impulses in preserving bureaucratic losses versus magnifying kindnesses shown through her reverent handling of Pearl's file. Final micro-choice to document "with a reverence that bordered on prayer" is earned via prior interior build. Flawless under pressure for single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to button discovery as pattern break, culminating in CR closure where documentation reconfigures her purpose with conceptual cost of systemic erasure. Orientation anchored early in file room post-emancipation. Cost legible in final prayer-like act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>File room's "high windows" and "accumulated dust patterns" constrain examination, charging button as micro-setting that mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Sensory selection (metal weight, softened edges) reflects POV urgency. Final image recharges dust/file integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving unrecorded kindnesses) signaled early, deepens via button discovery narrowing options to honor Pearl's gaze. Agency in turning button forces stance crystallization; felt cost in "magnify small kindnesses that official histories dismissed." Minor abstractness pre-discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of small kindnesses amid emancipation's orphans emerges organically via button's "thread of continuity," reweighting premise in final documentation without moralizing. Resonant CR answers "systems that pretended to know what was best" through particulars. No tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close voice stable, perceptual signature in projecting onto "metal until the meaning becomes visible." Rhythmic modulation peaks at button ("compass needle pointing toward a story"). No head-hopping; elision of backstory taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("pressed flower... compass needle") slightly muddles peak button beat without obscuring closure. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear in sequential examination. Read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-emancipation file room and Civil War button transforms orphan trope via archivist's grief, inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric reflection heightens stakes without gimmickry; button's "insignia of an infantry regiment" feels organic.</comment>
