<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory betrayal, grief, pride, and relief layer through embodied recall of mother's trembling hands and pendant; final endurance of "protected vulnerability" earned via micro-choices like silence and secret visits, revealing values hierarchy with ongoing cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as present anchors (sitting by icicle patterns, phone call) interleave backstory density, tightening to Charged Poise closure; final image of melting ice and "not fixed, but I am here" reconfigures wound with legible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (moss creeping racks, drip patterns on walls, puddle mirrors) filter through POV healing lens, mirroring internal states; moss garden and thawing ice charge final image, constraining reflection choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grafting meaning onto confession wounds signaled early, escalates accumulatively via place discovery and phone micro-turn deepening realization; agency in endurance forecloses isolation path, with cost felt in "unfixed" presence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of patient, quiet healing emerges organically from moss/water images shifting from decay to forgiveness; final "simply stay. Simply witness" offers resonant CR reweighting family shame without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (decay as forgiveness patterns); rhythmic, lyrical diction modulates from hush to charged poise, prose as character reflecting watchful patience under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and purposeful lyric figures (honeyed hush, moss grafting); minor "quietly" motif repetition taught early pays off without loops, propelling to clear closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of viral confession, tech-decay moss reclamation, and lyric healing; abandoned data center frame transforms wound-processing trope via nature's patient logic, risking quiet stasis payoff.</comment>
