<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concretely embodied in the seashell's warmth and gift as "wound," with contradictory impulses (healing echoes vs. personal isolation) compelling the final step into the song.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as perceptual density tightens to the melody's swell; Charged Poise closure in "stepped into the heart of the song" reconfigures her quest with aloneness as felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details like "starlight shifted, casting silver shadows" and canyon bounces selectively constrain her listening at the nexus, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncover echo truth escalates via humming crescendo and new future voice, narrowing to readiness choice; visible cost of "infinitely alone" crystallizes in closing step.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of trapped frequencies emerges organically from shell voices and nexus hum, with final image between "sound and silence" offering resonant repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias for "layered frequencies" sustains close third-person POV; rhythmic modulation peaks in swelling melody without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel from whispers to swell; minor figurative density in reflection ("wound that never fully healed") purposeful, not obscuring peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of perceptual fantasy and echo souls as "made" victims transforms mimicry trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
