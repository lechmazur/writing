<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, embodied in hush as shawl and spirit's tiredness; final pause before last knot reveals contradictory grief-impulse acting in scene, earning personal unmasking with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from knot-sighs to spirit-shimmer and hush-breaking tide; CR closure lands on-page in reflection-image, reweighting restoration premise with undeniable personal cost felt in "her own reflection... as a child."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prism shards and starlight constrain reveal and charge final image, mirroring internal states through fractured rainbows; sensory hush and light filtered via Mira's restorer priorities, vivid and purposeful without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of spirit-release signaled early tightens accumulatively via visible spirit-stir and luminous presence, narrowing to final knot with agency in needle-drive; cost legible in personal grief-reveal foreclosing emotional denial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of breaking-to-reveal emerges organically from masks/net/spirits, resonant CR in final voices-tide answering binding/unmasking question without moral; recharges prisms/light particulars non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature in hush/light diction; rhythmic modulation builds lyrical pressure to closure, elisions (fishermen secret) paid off in revelation without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm (short sighs amid long accumulations); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (frost-knot, heat-shimmer) enhancing peak without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mask-restoration/net-unbinding into personal unmasking, risk-taking lyric accumulation transforms tropes; final child-reflection turn inevitable from prior light/silence particulars.</comment>
