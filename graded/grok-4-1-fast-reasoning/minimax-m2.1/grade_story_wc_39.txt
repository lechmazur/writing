<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like reaching for a jar but choosing to listen, reveal contradictory impulses; final purpose shift earned through causality. Granddaughter's arrival applies secondary pressure effectively. Minor epiphany phrasing slightly abstracts peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from routine to music box discovery; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with legible cost in the handover's "gentle reluctance." Orientation anchored early in dunes/loft. One tightening via realization suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Feral loft and dunes constrain routine and discovery, charging final image as enduring studio; sensory details (clinking jars, swollen wood) selective and POV-biased toward sounds. Atmosphere of salt/sand mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sound collection vs. deeper purpose signaled early, tightens via box's melody forcing endurance of pure hoarding; agency in listening/handover forecloses isolation with felt relational cost. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of sounds-as-stories emerges organically from jars/box to generational translation; resonant CR in final purpose reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in handover gesture carries ambiguity of loss/gain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature attuned to sonic textures stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation heightens dawn/box moments. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual in handover.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (e.g., clinking jars into wind chimes); no loops, metaphors coherent and voice-motivated. Propulsion peaks in box melody unraveling chest.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-collection quirk into redemption arc transforms vagrant trope; music box reprise risks lyric intensity, heightening stakes organically to inevitable closure insight.</comment>
