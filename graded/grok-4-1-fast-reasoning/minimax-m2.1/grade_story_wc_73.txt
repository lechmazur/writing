<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dice rolls and hypotheses reveal rigorous yet daring traits under isolation, earning shift from escape to exploration; minor label-speak like "balancedly daring nature" slightly abstracts interiority without embodied contradiction in pivotal insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dice patterns deepen knowledge, culminating in on-page CR ("The infinite staircase was not confinement but boundlessness") with vertigo cost of misperceived years; orientation anchored early, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Infinite staircase pressures endless climb and landings for proofs/dice; chipped die as micro-setting charges final pocket image, mirroring perceptual shift; sensory focus on steps and paper selective via math bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand structure) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via chipped die's "dismissed formula," narrowing escape to conceptual rupture with foreclosed physical approach; cost felt in trembling realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of perception-as-reality emerges organically from dice imperfection aiding truth, resonant non-literal CR reprices confinement via final steps without moralizing; imperfection motif charges without checklist force.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with math-perceptual signature (angles of incidence, quantum-like); rhythm modulates insight builds; no dialogue, but diction purposeful without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density integrates proofs/dice into action; varied rhythm propels to closure; minor paraphrase around "rolled the dice" (twice close) nudges down but no template loops or muddled figures touch insight beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math-probability paradox with perceptual prison, transformed via chipped die's "deeper truth"; risk in quantum conceptual pivot feels inevitable from early proofs.</comment>
