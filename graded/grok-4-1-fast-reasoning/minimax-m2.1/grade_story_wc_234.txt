<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength in embodied interiority and earned change via columella handling; minor diagnostic slips like "palette of resolve" reduce contradiction immediacy without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup to CR closure ("The shell doesn't hold the secret. We do."); cost legible in mindset shift from extraction to acknowledgment, reconfiguring options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ember nexus and columella constrain sharing and charge final image; selective sensory weave (coals breathing, pearl-white flickers) mirrors internal density without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing presence density) deepens via Sera's prompt and spiral insight, tightening attention with felt cost of past "wrongness"; lens-consistent without causal force required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from spiral/ember returns to CR ("density of presence... by depth of attention"); resonant non-literal answer in final cheek-press avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (logarithmic intimacy); rhythmic diction modulates reflectively, dialogue subtextual in Sera's lean and hand-grasp.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; purposeful spiral recurrences avoid loops, no artifacts dull closure image of columella warmth seeping.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical science and shell geometry transforms reflection trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens intimacy stakes inevitably.</comment>
