<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's dutiful curiosity and embodied listening (e.g., feeling the hearing aid's lightness) earn her final run; Vera applies light pressure as client. Internal conflict subtle in routine vs. impossible message, with micro-choice to assure despite doubts. Minor slip: final motivation shift to "protect vulnerable voices" borders on unearned epiphany without stronger prior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from static to whisper ("Mom... Come find me") to CR closure in mist-run realization. Orientation anchored early (atrium, Elena's job). Cost legible in forgotten photo and plunge into mist; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium and twilight glass-to-mercury constrain choices (shadows pool, mist thickens for final run). Hearing aid as micro-setting charges pulses/whisper beat. Sensory filter (moth wings rhythm) POV-specific; no white-room, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trace Margot's thread) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pulse-to-voice shift narrowing routine to urgency. Agency in persistent dialing to message, costing photo abandonment. Escalation coherent under lens; minor abstractness in stakes until whisper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hearing silent calls emerges via hearing aid particulars, reweighted in CR ("dead... called to be heard"). Final mist image answers without moralizing; no thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with Elena's perceptual bias (frequencies between beats). Voice rhythmic/poetic yet controlled; Vera's whisper natural/subtextual. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "shadows pooled like spilled ink") propels without loops; metaphors coherent (glass to mercury). Rhythm varies for hush-to-run; no artifacts in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pulse-tracking hearing aid premise fresh, incidental heroism via routine transformed organically. Risky CR closure inevitable from setup; no template echoes.</comment>
