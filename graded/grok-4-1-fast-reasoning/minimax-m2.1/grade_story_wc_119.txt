<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied irony in hands folding wrappers precisely as before; letter response micro-choice reveals hierarchy of trusting flow over past, earning endurance with felt cost of foreclosing old world.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with density of prophetic patterns tightening to Charged Poise closure in final arrivals image reconfiguring orchestration as mutual; orientation anchored early in lighthouse/island; cost legible in "stepping back" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse beam and sea currents as micro-setting constrain choices (isolation channels flow) and charge final image; sensory selection (surf as old world sounds) POV-biased and purposeful, mirroring internal transposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transposing life signaled early, escalates accumulatively via letter tightening (past pulls vs. new flow), narrowing to renunciation; cost visible in sealed response and arrivals forcing stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of espionage-prophecy similarity emerges organically from particulars like microdot-to-fortunes shift; final image offers resonant non-literal answer to orchestration question, reweighting secrets' paths without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (spaces between words, light on faces); rhythmic control modulates reflective intensity; purposeful compression of fortune-writing beats legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "transposed into a new key" motif propels theme/prose); minor repetition of "wrote X and did not know Y" pattern-taught without obscuring; rhythm varies naturally, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spy-to-prophet frame transforms tropes via specific flow-directing logic; risk in lyric accumulative arrivals image heightens conceptual stakes inevitably.</comment>
