<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied via bare feet sensing hum and toes curling; motivation intensifies from waiting's fatigue to resolve at kneeling moment. Minor slip in overt epiphany phrasing ("meaning was not something you found...") borders therapy-speak but anchors to stone cue without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hum density builds to "chord of possibility" tightening, yielding Charged Poise closure as she rises with "earned" confidence, cost felt in reclaiming rebellion's shape amid fear. Orientation anchored early; one meaningful cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bare feet and stone circle constrain perception/choice, charging final barefoot exit image; sensory details (hum in grates/feet, slanting orange light) selective via POV urgency. Environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (create meaning in lull) signaled early, escalates via hum's shift forcing stance crystallization; agency in kneeling/palm-pressing forecloses passive waiting with felt cost of carrying purpose forward. Accumulative deepening reweights without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of created meaning emerges from circle's hum evolving from memory to possibility, resonant in final "thunderous serenity" image reweighting rebellion without moralizing. Particulars (glasses from stars to horizon) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (grandmother's patterns, star-margin bias); rhythm modulates from contemplative to resolute without filter excess. Voice texture distinct in syntax reflecting resolve's build.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; minor "confidence" repetition purposeful across "awkwardly" to "earned." No loops or artifacts dull closure image; propulsion aligns with hum's intensification.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi rebellion with pre-colonial mystic circle and barefoot embodiment transforms tropes; risk in quiet resolve (not violence) heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
