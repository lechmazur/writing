<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's contradictory impulses—fear of buried grief versus compelled return via telepathy—act in scene through embodied scars and micro-choices like clutching the hourglass, earning the closure acceptance with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of discoveries (ivy, tunnel, handprints) builds to CR closure in chamber where brother's echo reconfigures denial into awakening, with legible grief cost in "scars... evidence of love so fierce."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tower's cold stone, frost-rimmed hourglass, and hidden tunnel constrain choices (crawl despite scars) and charge final handprint image; sensory details like bare feet and coffee rings filter through Maya's recovering awareness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confront self-blame) signaled early via ivy; accumulative deepening through tunnel discovery narrows denial, forcing endurance with cost in scarred palms against brother's prints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reopening wounds for healing emerges organically from particulars (scars, coffee rings, handprints); final hourglass melt and meteor offer non-literal CR repricing past as "displaced miracle" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (plant voices, frost migration); rhythmic prose modulates from suspended dawn to charged hush, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punches in tunnel crawl, breathing paragraphs at revelations); no loops or artifacts, purposeful metaphors like "meteor hush" propel without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of accidental plant telepathy, coffee-ring vigil, and plaster handprints transforms grief trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens closure ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
