<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait embodied in persisting through cold water and tide despite sentiment critiques; interiority concrete via "reading absence like scripture," but final vocation realization edges toward unearned epiphany in "This was the moment she had been building toward."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from wading to inkwell discovery to note-placing; CR closure via final image of carrying the story with conceptual cost of pavilion's "long forgetting" legible in last lines; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pavilion micro-setting constrains via rising tide forcing exit and charges final image; sensory details (kelp "widow's veils," wet limestone) POV-filtered through shore expertise; purposeful economy integrates with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of wresting abandoned dreams signaled early via pavilion pull; textural escalation tightens through inkwell inscription and note-placing amid rising water, foreclosing prolonged stay with felt physical cost; agency in method coheres pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interlaced absence theme emerges organically from pavilion decay and inkwell message, reweighted in CR ending ("letter never sent") without moralizing; subtext in residue of intention charges quiet resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature ("shore's slow surrender"); rhythmic modulation builds to hushed intensity; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "broken tooth" propelling rhythm; minor overwriting in stacked images ("bruised sky," "hushed blaze") slightly muddles peak reflection but no loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh "archeologist of abandoned dreams" premise transforms erosion trope via inkwell's unfinished message; bold textural synthesis feels inevitable, risking lyric mode payoff at tide's rise.</comment>
