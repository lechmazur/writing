<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Characterization excels in embodied patience and loss-rooted motivation, with Elena's micro-choices in clock work revealing values under adaptation pressure; Mira applies subtle secondary pressure via screw revelation. Internal conflict emerges in simultaneous grief and discovery impulses during screw handling. Final acceptance earns stasis with visible cost of prior life's foreclosure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of fog/clock/screw images to Conceptual Repricing closure: "she saw more clearly than before," reweighting loss as gain with undeniable emotional cost in final hand-on-screw image. Single scene oriented early (shop/fog by para 1). Lens holds cleanly without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog and workbench constrain choices (occluded views sharpen attention), with recurring fog charging final lift image; clocks/tools tactile and lived-in, mirroring internal fog via selective POV filter. Sensory hierarchy favors touch/sight amid loss, evolving causally as fog clears.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (adapting sensing post-loss) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via screw revelation narrowing grief options; agency in patient work/endurance forecloses mourning path with felt cost in reconfigured clarity. One deepening suffices under lens, charging closure poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of veiled sensing emerges organically from clock lives/screw birth particulars, final image offering resonant CR answer (attention unveils miracles) reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences/gestures avoids platitudes; earned via struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with Elena's perceptual signature (occluded fog as sensing metaphor); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates gently, consistent idiom in sparse dialogue. No head-hopping; compression purposeful and pattern-taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm/syntax propelling insight beats; purposeful fog repetition accrues without loops, metaphors coherent (fog as veil). Zero scaffolds/artifacts; final line recharges motifs crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of water clocks/lost smell/birthing screw transforms loss trope into inevitable CR on veiled miracles; bold lyric risk heightens stakes via fog constraint without gimmickry.</comment>
