<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chimera twin interiority shines in "two rivers sharing a single current beneath ice," embodying contradictory mercy/curse with micro-choice to press card and step forward, earning closure renunciation of separation at felt cost of eternal duality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from card glimpses to memories altering; Charged Poise closure in "both trapped...impossibly free" lands with legible conceptual cost of recaptured inseparability, orientation anchored early in fog/ship.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rotting planks and rippling card constrain choices and charge final press; fog thinning mirrors internal reconfiguration, sensory hierarchy (grey light, current turn) selective via Mira's bias toward gardens/memories.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture garden/brother) tightens via memory alteration and voice clarification under Accumulative lens; agency in stepping forward forecloses isolation with felt cost of blissful trap in final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant unity emerges organically from palimpsest memories and garden lure, final "names waited to be remembered" reweights premise without moralizing, resonant via card/ship particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature particular in "double exposure" memories; rhythm modulates from descriptive to charged poise, diction controlled without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; figurative "veil being lifted" purposeful in peak beat, syntax varies for propulsion, final line recharges fog/ship motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Chimera twin on drifting carnival ship synthesizes surreal aberration into inevitable garden quest; risk in Accumulative lyricism heightens trapped-freedom stakes without gimmick.</comment>
