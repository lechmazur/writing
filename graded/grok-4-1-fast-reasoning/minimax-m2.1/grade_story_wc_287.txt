<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren's wistfully pragmatic trait drives sharing the gauge and honest "probably," earning the final planting as endurance with cost; girl's tears apply crucible pressure without stock resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density (rose, gauge, harbor); orientation anchors in first para; closure as Charged Poise in "something was already stirring" reconfigures loss with patience cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rosebush branches and harbor moonlight constrain waiting/pruning choices and charge final stirring image; sensory oars rhythm mirrors father's hands, filtering through Maren's grief bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (instill hope in grief) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via girl's climb and planting micro-turn narrowing to shared endurance; cost legible in foreclosed mourning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of renewal-through-patience emerges organically from rose roots remembering; final gauge-to-moon reflection offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable with perceptual signature (measurements/wild growth); dialogue natural/subtextual ("keys... heart that's closed"), distinguishing adult wisdom from child's silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short declarative peaks in sharing); high density integrates motif/action; minor overwriting in "quivering hush" repetition but no loops or muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lockmaster talisman, fire-escape rose, and grief-planting transforms vignette tropes; risk in code-switch petal image ("红色叹息") heightens specificity without gimmick.</comment>
