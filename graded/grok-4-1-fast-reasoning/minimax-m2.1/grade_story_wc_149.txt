<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory mournful elation acts in scene via her solidification and smile, earning the near-closure of her penance through prior causal service; gardener's ink-stained fingers and eyes remembering loss reveal character under pressure. Backstory anchors to present bead-handling without flattening stakes. Final hand on glass reveals values hierarchy with binding cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of ghostly vignettes builds to Charged Poise closure: Elara's hand through glass shifts debt balance with centuries-long swim cost legible in "mournful elation" line. Orientation anchored by opening greenhouse/ashen-veil. Single scene, no shards, lens unambiguous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Propagation chamber constrains Elara's bead-pressing choice and charges final image of silver bark/new growth; endless night presses glass, mirroring isolation. Sensory hierarchy (frost/ferment/chill) filtered through ghostly POV. Alchemical details evolve with events, tactile via ghost-touch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt repayment) signaled early, tightens texturally as scions bloom and venom blesses gardener, narrowing Elara's binding options. Agency in pulsing bead and solidification; cost felt in "swimming through winter-cracked fields." Single decisive deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of growth's binding cost emerges via bead/venom passing, reweighting fire-debt in final image without statement. Resonant non-literal answer: gardener's tears as "ancient grief and older joy," charging closure. Particulars (alchemical roses, silver bark) build complexity, no tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (light-imprisoned fruit, smoke-trailing dress) modulates rhythmically to peak solidification. Stable third-limited focalization on Elara, seamless to gardener's tears without head-hopping. No dialogue; compression taught early, paid in closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: each line advances texture/stakes (e.g., "loving venom" pulses action/meaning). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (glowing fruit/luminous coffin). Minor figurative density in opening beat purposeful, pattern-taught without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ghost bride alchemically transforms trope via debt-bound service and venom-blessing; synthesis of gothic orchard/ghostly ledger feels inevitable. Bold lyric risk heightens resonance in "crystalline moment" without gimmick. Fresh inflection: bead's warmth reconfigures centuries' arc.</comment>
