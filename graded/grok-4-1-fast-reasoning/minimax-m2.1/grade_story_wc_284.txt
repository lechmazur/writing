<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like reading snow codes despite scars, earn the closure gesture; embodied emotion in "burned face unreadable" reveals flaws without labels. Minor reflection slips in convalescence block slightly blunt pivotal handoff momentum.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from snow signals to ally emergence; on-page Charged Poise closure in pillbox handoff reconfigures courage stake with legible scar cost at "smiled despite the scars." Orientation anchors early; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Snow drifts and mist constrain choices (e.g., reading spiral/cross/line signals path despite danger) and charge final image ("mist seemed to brighten"); selective sensory hush mirrors spy priorities. Micro-setting as body/scars integrates flawlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver proof, reclaim courage) signaled early tightens accumulatively via snow danger cross and exposed climb; agency in handoff forecloses hiding with scar/identity cost legible. Single deepening suffices; no major reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of dormant courage melting emerges organically from snow/pillbox particulars to final chest stir; resonant non-literal close in spring mist reweights breakage without moralizing. Subtext in ally's vouchsafe implies relational fix.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward cipher/snow reading; poetic rhythm ("wind spoke in hushed tongues") modulates with hush to brighten cadence. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("not alone... to help") advances alliance cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm/syntax; no loops, clear propulsion in snow code beat. Minor overwriting in mist repetition voice-motivated, charges closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Snow codes as cipher transform spy trope freshly; prudently daring climb + pillbox cipher yield non-obvious synthesis inevitable at handoff. Bold seasonal hush risks poetic without gimmick.</comment>
