<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied (pressure in teeth, certainty unexplained on touch); curiosity as hunger drives micro-choices under inversion pressure; final renunciation earned via echoes' warning, foreclosing exploitation with responsibility as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to CR closure where "responsibility settle[s] like a second skin" reweights resilience principle with conceptual cost; orientation anchored early (pilot, orchard planet, inversion); one tightening via artifact touch reveals echoes/truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (ascending water spirals, grinding arches like bells) filters through pilot bias, constrains navigation (follows currents to tree), charges final descent image; floating arches evolve causally with inversion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (source of resilience) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via discovery/escalating echoes that force renunciation; agency in following flows/touching artifact narrows options; cost legible in "carry only the knowledge," charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of resilience as protected principle emerges organically via arrow's revelation/prior pilots' choices; final image ("ordinary miracle... survive its own transformations") offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting curiosity as guardianship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (pilot instincts carve focus, resonance calls across systems); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity (whirling silence to ordinary sounds); purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short inversion beats vs. flowing descriptions), metaphors coherent/purposeful ("crystalline question marks," "fingers of clasped hands"); no loops, strong verbs propel to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: gravity-inverting orchard planet + arrow as renewal key transforms exploration trope via specific pilot curiosity/past echoes; risk-taking in surreal physics heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via inversion logic.</comment>
