<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied persistence and pride flaw drive micro-choices like unpacking tools despite failure; ribbon-handling reveals fractured maternal bond. Interiority concrete via craft details, but epiphany's "accidental wisdom" edges toward diagnostic summary, softening contradiction depth at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density (pears, light-shift, shards) builds to CR closure where mended eye and daughter's silhouette reprice vows with relational cost ("feisty heart stuttered, then soared"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory progression (amber to moonlight, rotting pears amid shards) mirrors repair, constraining choices—pear litter scatters quartz pieces; orchard-rafters charge final image as "constellation of leaves." POV-filtered via craftswoman's eye, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend eye/breach to reclaim daughter/wisdom) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via grinding persistence narrowing to admission ("tools alone" insufficient), forcing ribbon-offering with embodied cost (aching knees). Closure charges poise without decisive antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Deciduous vows" motif emerges organically from pears/orchard, reweighting via ribbon's undecaying tie as non-literal answer to persistence's limits. Final image resonates without moralizing, though realization paragraph articulates theme explicitly, muting pure subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-POV, perceptual signature craft-specific (shard-fitting precision); rhythm modulates from descriptive entry to terse closure ("heart stuttered, then soared"). Compression purposeful, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short closure punch vs. flowing builds); metaphors cohere (vows-to-leaves) without muddle. Minor scaffold in reflective block ("promises that had burst... dropped away"), but interleaved with action, no closure touch or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cathedral orchard as decaying vows crucible transforms redemption trope via quartz-mending craft; daughter's moonlit return risks quiet poise payoff, inevitable from persistence arc without hedging.</comment>
