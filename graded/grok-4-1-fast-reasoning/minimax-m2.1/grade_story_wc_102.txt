<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Embodied emotion peaks in breathing shifts from shallow to mourning-to-acceptance, earning the healing choice; interiority concrete via salt-tongue grief and marrow-pull, though one epiphanic summary ("unused love... waiting") slightly abstracts pivotal realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from memory-echo to tendril-reveal to capture-transformation; on-page RR closure via tendrils flowing "back into the world as something new" with emotional cost legible in Mei's "rhythm of healing"; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory weave (wisteria density, firefly thoughts, mist-thick scent) filters through spiritual POV, constraining sight via viaduct stones and charging final exhale image where wisteria leans and fireflies pause.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release unused love) signaled early and tightens accumulatively via breathing-reveal narrowing to apparatus-capture; agency in exhale-gathering forecloses retention with mourning-cost, though deepening relies more on perceptual shift than trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of love-residue release emerges organically from tendril-image and camera-translation, answered non-literally in final flow-home reconfiguration without moralizing; resonance reweights premise via viaduct-exhale.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (light-residue, shadow-questions) with rhythmic modulation under stress; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged closure diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and integrated sensory propulsion; figurative pattern (light-gleams, tendrils) coherent without muddle, though opening simile-stack ("held breath", "liquid pearl") borders density-overload in low-pressure setup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spiritual photography and unused-love tendrils transforms tropes via camera-obscura mechanics and spark-pilgrim frame; risk in lyric accumulation heightens closure ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
