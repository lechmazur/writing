<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority shines in embodied details like trembling hands deciphering the final chime, revealing contradictory impulses between routine absorption and unprecedented intervention. Final choice to offer naked truth is earned via prior unease buildup. Geologist's response tests her motivation without headcount overload.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of chimes and mirror builds to Charged Poise closure where researchers' certainty flaps like loose sail, with conceptual cost of embracing "maybe" legible in dawn image. Orientation anchored early; single scene progression fits defaults. No lens ambiguity; cost undeniable in final shard vessel.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Wind chimes as micro-setting constrain her process via encoded doubts, charging closure; lighthouse wind and fog mirror internal threadbare cloak. Sensory selection (salt/regret breeze, chime tones) purposeful, POV-biased toward moral cues. Final beam illuminating doubt motes recharges environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (absorb doubt into liveable certainty) signaled early, tightens via final cracked bell's ancient-killing note forcing her agency in unscripted offer. Accumulative deepening reweights to nuance embrace; geologist's coral vision pays visible cost. No abstract stakes; pressure coheres to ending reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of nuance vs. certainty emerges organically via chimes/mirror progression, culminating in resonant final image of raw chime music and "honest world of maybe" without moralizing. Protected vulnerability motif shifts from her cloak to their collective stance. Counter-readings linger in persistent grief cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (moral radiation, musical ciphers); rhythmic modulation peaks in her "outgrown coat" speech carrying subtext. Sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors consistent (flapping sail, dust motes) without muddle, though minor figurative density in opening risks slight opacity. No loops/artifacts; propulsion clear to final image. Read-aloud ear strong, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh conscience-for-hire premise transformed via inventive chimes/shard mechanics; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry. Non-obvious synthesis of doubt-as-atmosphere feels inevitable in hindsight coral vision turn.</comment>
