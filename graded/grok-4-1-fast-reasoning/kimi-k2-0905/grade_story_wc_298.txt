<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in narrator's hesitation over mother's hum memory, compelling surrender that alters trajectory; Lira's reckless idealist traits force mutual vulnerability, earning final witness role. Interiority particular via whistling soul holes and leaking memories. Final renunciation of full patching earned with relational cost on Lira sagging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of orchard images builds to barter tightening, yielding CR closure in sprout's hum reweighting soul-patching premise with ledger cost. Orientation anchored early in catacomb orchard. Single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard constrains via roots tightening ankles during hesitation, charges final sprout image mirroring internal reconfiguration. Sensory vivid (damp earth, candle smoke, glowing fruit), POV-filtered through apology-brushing bones. Micro-setting (skull-cradled trunk) evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (soul patching via memory barter) signaled early, tightens in hum trade foreclosing easy forgetfulness with Lira's hollowing cost. Agency in narrator's nods and carrying her; micro-turn at her sagging narrows to deliberate gaps. Pressure coheres accumulatively without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of deliberate soul gaps emerges via barter events, resonant in "weaving new cloth, leaving deliberate spaces" realization without statement. Final image (humming sprout) non-literally answers patching question, reweighting memories as orchard ledger entries. Subtext in Lira's scars-as-doors habit layers ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV stable, perceptual signature in inlayed meanings and dusky metaphors biases noticing (roots as wires). Voice rhythmic, modulates from urgent to poised; dialogue sparse but subtextual ("some holes must remain"). No head-hopping, elisions taught via card burn.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring emotional cadence; metaphors consistent (mosaic grout, ledger roots) without muddle in peak barter. Minor overwrite in orchard descriptions risks density dip but pattern-taught pays in closure glow. No loops, clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard bartering transforms soul-repair trope via bone-root ledger, inevitable in hindsight from early Star card. Bold synthesis of tarot, memories, post-uprising decay risks surrealism but coheres under textural lens. Fresh final sprout hum charges premise without retreat.</comment>
