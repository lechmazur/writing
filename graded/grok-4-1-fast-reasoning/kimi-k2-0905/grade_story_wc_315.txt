<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in trust vs. revision tension, embodied in pulse drumming and breath clouds; handover choice earned via prior signal conflicts, with felt cost in foreclosed vigilance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through pattern density to CR closure in buckle handover and bark etching; cost unmistakable in "lighter by one buckle but heavier by one choice."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor constrains descent and post return, charging final etching image; sensory selectivity (leaf rhythm, moonlit canopy) mirrors pattern-seeking bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of network preservation tightens accumulatively via stolen signal and mirror-self recognition, forcing renunciation agency with legible cost in revised oath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trust's revision emerges organically from particulars, answered non-literally in etched "releases" reweighting vigilance as threat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with pattern-perceptual signature; rhythmic modulation peaks at handover snap, radio voice subtextual and apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels with purposeful "soundless echo" motif; minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but pattern-taught avoids muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-folded self and buckle relay transforms watcher trope; older pilot twist inevitable from pattern anomalies.</comment>
