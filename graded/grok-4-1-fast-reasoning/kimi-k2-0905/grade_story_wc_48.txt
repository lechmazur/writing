<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict peaks when Lira accuses "You left me mid-knock," forcing contradictory impulses of hoarding vs. rewriting to act simultaneously, earning her renunciation of the shell with embodied cost (heat spreading, sentences rearranging).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as cameos densify into vortex of voices, delivering Charged Poise closure when shell becomes lighthouse ("polishing its ridges"), reconfiguring hoarding to release with legible cost (pockets empty, hopes internalized).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Seashell fragment as micro-setting constrains collecting (hopes fold in) and charges final image as "private lighthouse," with mist's sensory details (salt, wet paper on eyelashes) mirroring her perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to collect hopes tightens accumulatively through cameos to Lira's accusation and vortex, her agency in offering shell ("Take your shapes") foreclosing hoarding with visible cost in internalized hopes rustling like pages.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of releasing hopes emerges organically from cameos folding into shell then dissolving inward, final image of shell on windowsill reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("fog curled into quotation marks around her ankles") stable in single POV, modulating rhythm with pressure; Lira's dialogue carries subtext of abandonment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel through mist beats, though minor figurative density (e.g., "angular, something that scraped") risks slight opacity in peak vortex without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of writerly abandonment via mist-born cameos from deleted characters, transformed in shell's evolution to internalized lighthouse guiding "tomorrow's unread stories."</comment>
