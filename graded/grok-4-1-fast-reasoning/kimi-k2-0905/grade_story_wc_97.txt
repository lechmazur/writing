<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (eternal waiting vs. forward motion) act vividly in the film-loop realization and final chord, earning the exit choice with the cost of forsaking "maybes"; interiority particular via clock-winding ritual and embodied "steely longing."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density builds to Conceptual Repricing closure: clock ticks freely post-loop, reweighting waiting with undeniable opportunity cost in "Onward" board and new chime; orientation anchored early, one tightening via film entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Surreal settings (shaft, tidal arbor, film platform) constrain choices—ladder ascent, fog dissolution—and charge final image; sensory selectivity (ozone/cedar, celluloid edges) mirrors emotional narrowing, no spatial incoherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (waiting vs. composing arrival) signaled early, deepens via loop-rehearsal epiphany driven by her agency (trading chime, resolving chord), foreclosing loop-safety with legible cost in real-night confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of waiting-as-rehearsal emerges organically via particulars (frozen chime to ticking freedom), final image resonantly reweights "surprise fate" without moral; ambiguity lingers in "unplanned encore" without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual bias (compasses as fears, cloud-roots tugging); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure, elisions taught early (surreal hatch) pay off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., "sprocket holes rimmed with moonlight"); varied rhythm propels without loops, figurative pattern taught early avoids muddle even in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of piano/film/loop transforms waiting trope into "rehearsal" with inevitable hindsight payoff; bold sky-garden risk heightens stakes organically.</comment>
