<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through embodied pursuit of dream; contradictory impulses in risking unnamed memory for cipher; final saturation as earned change with cost, compelling higher stakes in dawn coaxing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to RR closure: decisive snap transfers image to shelves, restoring voices with felt cost (palette cracks, airy saturation); orientation anchored early in library/archipelago; one tightening at dream sighting suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (causeway tide licks, shy horizon risks memory trade) and charges final image (coral shelves pulse); sensory hierarchy via POV (light/salt focus); micro-setting like sand-book pages glimmers under polite address, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream) signaled early, tightens via agency in painting corridor to coax boat, foreclosing darting evasion; cost legible in implosion and saturation; escalation as density cadence under Accumulative lens to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of longing decoded emerges organically from particulars; final image (hush containing colors/cipher/sunrises) offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting absence to brimming; no moralizing, ambiguity in luminous returns lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (light as heat lightning, neon seaweed); rhythmic poetic compression taught early, modulates under climax stress; no head-hopping, inference matches knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm passes read-aloud; figurative heavy but coherent/pattern-taught (light-painting metaphors consistent, no muddle); minor density drag in setup sentences offset by peak clarity at "light imploded into the lens."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of librarian painting light to photograph dreams transforms tropes; risk in poetic elision heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via cipher payoff; no derivative echoes, bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
