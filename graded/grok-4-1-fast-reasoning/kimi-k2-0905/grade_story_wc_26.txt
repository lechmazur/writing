<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Embodied shadow as "second heart" and contradictory impulses (consider dropping stone) act simultaneously; final internalization earned by lifelong dusk cataloguing and footage comparison, with visible self-vanishing cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density tightens from stone warming to metamorphosis under colliding lights; RR closure lands on-page when Mira locks heartbeat and shadow in vault, reconfiguring hope as unshareable with personal erasure cost ("became the last dusk itself").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recurring river stone constrains choices (set between projectors) and charges final image as "tiny planet"; orchid-walls and vault integrate tactilely into action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve unshareable hope) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via glimmering stone and shadow's whisper; agency in threading reels and pressing stone forces trade-off, with erasure cost unmistakable in pulse-recording and vanishing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of unshareable hope vs. commodified dreams emerges organically from stone's evolution and mother-daughter silhouette; final image ("violet afterimage") offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting premise with loss/lightness cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in precise shades ("exact shade of violet") and textures ("surface rippling like water"); rhythmic lyricism modulates with intensity, elisions purposeful and legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figuratives ("continents of silver regret and oceans of gold hope") taught early as voice pattern, propels via varied syntax; zero loops or scaffolds, closure image crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shareable dreams world with stone as memory-holder-planet transforms preservation trope; risk-taking in lyric compression inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes via unshareable vanishing.</comment>
