<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between past velocity and present decay act vividly in ghost confrontation; final acceptance of shared erosion is earned via prior fragment releases with embodied cost in ribs' cold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through density build to on-page CR in fractured stillness; cost legible in dissolved images and ghost's wave from bench.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Obsidian mare and rising cloudwater constrain mounting/anchoring choices; lagoon's violet glow and mirrored tiles charge final dissolving fog image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of negotiating eroded ambitions tightens texturally via ghost's accusation and wheel-breaking; agency in shared reading forecloses pure ambition with emulsified dreams cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Eroded ambitions theme emerges organically from particulars like ticket stubs and undeveloped squares; final image reweights velocity/decay without moral, lingering in weary wave.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in reversed-name hisses and jittering legs; stable first-person perceptual bias modulates rhythmically under pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm in "clicks like a cracked vertebra"; no loops, varied syntax propels to closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carousel-ghost negotiation transforms regret tropes via camera wheel's latent images; risk in surreal chronology heightens stakes organically.</comment>
