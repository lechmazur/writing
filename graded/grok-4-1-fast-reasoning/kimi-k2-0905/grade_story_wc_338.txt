<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional character-particular interiority via map-trusting vs. video-omission tension; embodied hush "curl[ing] inside her ribs like warm smoke" grounds empathy; entry choice earned by prior quieting with cost of unfilmed silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observation density builds to CR closure; map tear aligning with "henge’s fallen lintel" shadow anchors pivotal reconfiguration with conceptual cost of inverted known/unknown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rain and fresco vault constrain via erasure/rinsing and peeling layers mirroring realizations; disciplined "stormlight" beam charges bench closure image indispensably.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of empathetic silence interpretation deepens through footage ghosting and self-quieting agency; drowned projectors and unfilmed threshold make cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Silence-as-inverted-map theme emerges organically from torn parchment, peeling fresco, and fluttering knit; bench realization offers resonant non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "omission here was a scream wearing silence"; rhythmic modulation sustains close third POV through pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (no muddle in peak realizations); varied syntax propels to "every map eventually reopens at its tear" without loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of maps/footage/silence as self-reopening threshold; bold lyric inversion feels inevitable, heightening stakes in final knitting image.</comment>
