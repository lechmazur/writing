<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's curator traits drive micro-choices from tool use to communal presence, earning shift with embodied curiosity ("dust between her ribs"); contradictory impulses peak in borescope failure yielding witnessing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via rumor density to communal silence as Charged Poise RR; closure cost legible in "mystery not solved but absorbed," reweighting options without opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Courtyard mosaics, fountain hush, and desert cold constrain shift to presence and charge final crescent; sensory hierarchy (pulse over visuals) reflects Mira's ear-priority bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove listening heals) deepens agency-driven from solo probe to communal endurance under Accumulative lens; borescope-to-silence tightening forecloses solving with absorption cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Listening-as-healing emerges via locket echo and offerings, final image reweights premise non-literally; "key we already are" resonates as CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("sand waits for wind") biases toward object-stories, rhythmic control heightens pulse beat; stable single-POV elides nothing unearned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density weaves action-atmosphere (e.g., "plum to peach"); varied rhythm propels dawn-dusk arc, zero loops or muddled figs in peak silence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mailbox-heartbeat transforms mystery into communal healing proof; risky Accumulative lyricism synthesizes curator lens with sandstorm poise, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
