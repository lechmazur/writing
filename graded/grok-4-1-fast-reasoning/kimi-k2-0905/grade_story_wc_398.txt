<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength in concrete interiority via sensory memory triggers like crushed leaves and scorched paper; motivation to nurture understanding compels graft decision with felt cost of nineteen years' wait. Minor weakness: internal conflict leans reflective summary over simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal realization beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from letter discovery to CR closure; orientation anchored in first paragraph. Decisive image of regrafting decision and new note lands on-page with legible cost in "risk tasted suddenly like hope," reconfiguring destiny premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like saffron light on calloused hands constrain choices by charging pavilion as memory crucible; recurring vines mirror internal shift and charge final breathing image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reviving "impossible" love tightens via letter-triggered deepening under accumulative lens, narrowing to graft agency with emotional cost of family verdicts. Escalation coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mismatches as strength emerges organically from vine parallels, reweighting premise in final CR image of "second draft" without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in stars swelling with fruit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct vitner perceptual signature in biased noticing of soils, tannins; rhythmic modulation heightens reflective pressure, prose as character in syntactic flow matching contemplative state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; figurative pattern of wine/vine metaphors taught early without muddle. Minor overwrite in sustained metaphors during peak realization slightly dulls pace before closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost love via unheard-of tempranillo-chardonnay graft transforms trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes through grafting parallel to hearts.</comment>
