<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied noticing of "porches leaning one degree closer to the sea"; contradictory impulses in collecting trifles yet leaving absences unfilled earn the final renunciation. Mission refines through pressure without tidy epiphany. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from bay walk to crawlspace center; CR closure lands on-page as compass stills and houses sigh, with cost in "some absences, once named, need no filling." Orientation anchored early; no shards or transitions violate defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orris shard and compass as micro-settings constrain choices (pressed to sill reveals vision; crushed at center stills pivot) and charge final image of restored houses. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (violet grounding mutations); details evolve causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore arrhythmic houses) signaled early tightens accumulatively via Morse-led descent and orris-crushing; agency forecloses filling path with felt cost in pocketed tissue as new absence. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise at emergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of conversational homes emerges organically from displaced objects' sanctification; final image ("hushed blaze of recognition") resonantly reweights premise without moral, embracing ambiguity of unfilled absences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature ("house heartbeat," "grammar of what had been removed"); rhythmic modulation fits lyric texture, purposeful compression taught early via poetic elisions paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and read-aloud rhythm; figurative coherence (e.g., "violet flare that did not illuminate but deepened the shadows") purposeful in peak crawlspace without muddle or loops. Minor density in metaphors touches non-closure beats only.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of creeping normality into sentient houses via orris-sanctified absences; bold lyric risk (Morse-flickering streetlights) heightens stakes organically, transforming haunted-house tropes through grounded particulars.</comment>
