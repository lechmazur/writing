<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's expertise in sounds and walks drives micro-choices like identifying the stranger and leading to the door, with embodied tension ("pressed herself against a rusted wall"). Woman's motivation clear via inheritance but slightly told; earned change in Mira's realization of maps' limits forecloses prior competence with conceptual cost. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak whisper beat prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: stranger's clink → identification → collaboration → sound-key reveal → door opens into chamber revelation (CR closure). Orientation anchored in first paragraph (port labyrinth, storm). Conceptual cost legible in "her maps had been incomplete," reweighting premise without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Labyrinth's corrugated corridors, rust, vibrations constrain navigation and amplify whispers, charging final chamber image. Sensory hierarchy via Mira's ear (metallic whisper cuts hum) reflects expertise; storm aurora guides choices purposefully. Environment shapes climax mechanics without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover war secret) signaled early via maps/stranger; causal tightening at sound-lock reveal narrows to whisper challenge, forcing collaboration. Agency in Mira's lead and joint action; cost in incomplete maps realized on-page. No reversal but sufficient deepening under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet voices enduring via acoustic network emerges organically from whispers, coins, storm resonance; final line ("by sound") offers non-literal CR repricing without moralizing. Subtext in "calculated spontaneity" and grandmother's legacy charges closure image. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with Mira's perceptual signature (walks, vibrations, whispers); dialogue natural/subtextual ("Looking for someone?" tests). Rhythm modulates with tension; distinct voices (Mira's low pitch vs. woman's clear whisper). Clean free indirect without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "short strides... hesitation" advances plot/character/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Purposeful "whisper" repetition taught early pays off acoustically. Minor overwriting in aurora reflections but no peak-beat muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shipping labyrinth as whisper amplifier during storm transforms storage trope into acoustic machine. Risky acoustic premise follows implications to war-network reveal; inevitable in hindsight via sound motifs. Non-obvious moral calculus elevates.</comment>
