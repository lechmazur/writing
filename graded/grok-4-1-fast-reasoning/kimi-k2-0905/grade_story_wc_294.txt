<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Jonah's motivation to unpack looping grief drives concrete micro-choices like fanning notes east-west and trading the ouguiya, earning the realization that borders must be marked to walk away; contradictory impulses (grief as bad GPS vs. calm ritual) act in scene. Mara's arrival forces relational crucible without stereotypes. Final renunciation feels compelled by prior causality, with visible cost in the reduced collection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from solitary ritual to shared spiral and fire, culminating in Charged Poise RR where trading relics reconfigures past loops into circulation ("fewer by one but finally in circulation"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words (circus train, Jonah's folder). Cost legible in final image of parted ways and sighed fire.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Circus train's rust drip, iron floor, and brass railings constrain the spiral ritual and charge the fire's manners; recurring vines/posters mirror dying loops. Sensory hierarchy (hush of fields, match strike) reflects Jonah's perceptual calm under grief. Final "iron, popcorn, unopened roads" recharges setting with forward poise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths circle back) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via Mara's shared stories and joint spiral, forcing stance crystallization in promises and trade-off (bill for charcoal tee). Agency in arranging/igniting forecloses looping path with felt cost. Coherent pressure under textural lens, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of breaking circles emerges organically from spiral motif shifting to parted relics, offering non-literal answer ("some circles... broken by walking calmly forward") that reweights grief without moralizing. Subtext in traded stories and fire respecting edge embraces ambiguity. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature ("polished calm... perceptively calm") biased toward dusky textures; dialogue natural/subtextual (pivot tables vs. beer trucks) distinguishes voices idiomatically. Rhythmic control modulates from hush to flame glow without leakage. Elision of backstories taught via cues, paid in ritual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "territorial markers for memory" advances character/atmosphere); varied rhythm passes ear test. Frequent figuratives ("dying fireworks," "moth wing") coherent/voice-motivated, no muddle in peak spiral-fire beat. Minor repetition ("polished calm") purposeful, not looped.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of circus-train ritual, foreign notes spelling sentences, and startup relics transforms ghost-father trope into textural map of unreachable places; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens closure charge. Non-obvious angle on grief as rerouting feels inevitable from spiral's rust-to-sand arc.</comment>
