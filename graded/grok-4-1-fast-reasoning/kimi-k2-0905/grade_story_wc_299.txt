<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices culminate in earned shift from appraiser's failure to resonant purpose, shown in mic-patching sequence; contradictory impulses between factual ledger and memory hum effectively under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from public failure cue to Polaroid discovery and mic echo, landing Charged Poise RR/CR in reflection on internal applause with felt emotional cost; orientation anchored early in trailer scene, single shard coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quarry trailer micro-setting supplies surplus mic/PA and dusty envelope that constrain patching choice and charge final echo image; sensory details like diesel/paper smells and starlit water selectively filter through roadie POV, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of purpose after job-loss public failure tightens via agency in recognizing van → patching/speaking into foreman offer, with accumulative cadence shift reweighting options; visible cost in foreclosed isolation path legible in chest resonance line.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of internal resonance emerges organically from grille cloth motif and echo return, reweighting loss-to-purpose in final image without overt moralizing; minor explicitness in "purpose after loss" line slightly undercuts subtext density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct roadie perceptual signature in musical syntax/rhythm modulates intensity from blurred ledger to echo thrill; sparse foreman dialogue natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied rhythm and zero loops; metaphors like "pulse thudded like a kick drum" cohere without muddle, charging closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie-appraiser arc with Polaroid/mic echo transforms loss trope into inevitable internal reconfiguration; risk in accumulative reflection pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
