<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's precognitive curse concretely constrains his rock placements, revealing helpless witnessing as a core flaw that earns the momentary lift. Interiority ties embodied actions (barefoot on slick rocks) to Mira's promise without stock epiphanies. Final touch of dissolving eel forecloses the "understand" path with felt conceptual cost, showing hierarchy of surrender over control.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through rock placements to CR closure: realization of patterns consuming creators, with legible cost in empty pouch and fading constellation ("another star in the geometry of absence"). Orientation anchored early (tidal bluff, no-friction world). Persistent curse constraint shapes tactics; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>No-friction slick rocks constrain precise placements ("remained perfectly still"), while aurora and tide guide sequences; recurring painted rocks charge final eel-air migration image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (eel herder notes sinuous slips, magnetic fields). Details evolve causally (resonating air equations).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfill Mira's promise via patterns) signaled early, tightens accumulatively at ninth rock's singing dust, forcing surrender realization. Agency in precise placements narrows to touching eel, paying visible cost (dissolves into light). Pressure coheres under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of surrender to unseen patterns emerges organically from rock sequences, curse visions, and Mira's words reweighted at end ("patterns consume their creators"). Final image (eels in air, promise "broken by understanding") offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Particulars (golden ratios, spaces between) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (geometric noticing: spirals, ratios, interference patterns). Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, compressing under resonance buildup ("shimmering equations written in light"). No head-hopping; purposeful elision of "why" taught early, pays off in CR.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, sound (dust "sing—a sound like whale song crossed with the ringing of crystal"); figurative language purposeful and pattern-taught (sacred geometries). No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts in closure beat; varied syntax propels to final chord.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of no-friction surrealism, precog eel herder, and mathematical eels-air migration transforms tropes organically. Bold premise fully committed (friction's absence enables sky-swimming); risk in CR closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitable hindsight from early star dust pulse to dissolving eel.</comment>
