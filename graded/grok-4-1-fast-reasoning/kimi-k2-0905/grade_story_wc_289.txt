<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like kneeling to place the twig where the thread dissolves, reveal a keeper of secrets yearning to rejoin; earned change via releasing ghostwritten lines through doves. Minor flaw in epiphany feeling slightly unearned from prior contradiction, but closure choice aligns with motivation. No safety-hedging; flaws complicate via unaddressed heart.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from projection to weaving galaxy, culminating in CR where twig crumbles and she walks lighter, reweighting the premise of connection via telling with legible cost (nest's weight lost). Orientation anchored early in temple/lily pond post-rain. Single scene, no shards; closure image ("I am here" echoed back) pays off deliberate poetic disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: wet marble/incense air, chime-releasing pontoon constraining hesitation, projection's red thread mirroring internal search and charging final red dot. POV-filtered details (prismatic light flinging rain) evolve causally, subtly guiding twig placement and release. Recurring lily pond tilts mirror at climax, recharging stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rejoin via finding thread) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through twig-weaving reversal that narrows to release, with deepening realization foreclosing isolation at "world answered back." Protagonist agency in placement triggers pressure; cost visible in crumbling nest and lighter step. One tightening sufficient, charges Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of connection via telling emerges organically from particulars: ghostwritten sentences floating as scarves, doves returning letters, graffiti addition answering "Tell me the truth." Final image ("hush of color: We know") offers non-literal resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting prior secrecy with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature: biased toward color/memory weaves ("rose bleeding into gold"), modulating rhythm with intensity (short sentences at laugh/doves). Purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping or withholding. Prose texture reflects whimsical mind without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety and high density propel: varying sentence openings, integrated imagery ("feathers turned into paper airplanes") advance image/atmosphere. Minor overwriting in weaving beat ("palette of every letter... folded into sentences") with dense figuratives risks coherence but pattern-taught as prismatic motif pays at closure. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dulling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms ghostwriter trope into magical realism where temple breathes vows into skin, twig births galaxy of returned letters; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens resonance without gimmickry. Inevitable hindsight: projection thread seeds non-obvious closure echo ("We know"), committing fully to prismatic premise.</comment>
