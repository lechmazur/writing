<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between father's perceptive eyes noticing blood-fed roses and mother's pacifist path, embodied in grafting choices; final planting earns continuity with felt cost of accepting violence. Minor epiphanic summary in "she understood now" at close slightly softens but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of weaving/grafting building to CR closure in final planting image where roots pulse, reweighting chaos into continuity with conceptual cost legible in "braiding them into something stronger." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene fits defaults perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cracked dome, thorny roses, and blood-soaked earth constrain grafting and charge final planting; sensory details (rose scent amid ruin, amber sunset) filter through Mira's priorities, evolving with night's work to mirror transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of weaving continuity tightens accumulatively through grafting scrap into stems, foreclosing vengeance path with cost in hybrid rose's canvas-patterned permanence; agency in patient tending narrows options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transforming violence into peace emerges organically from rose-grafting particulars, resonating in final image uniting hunter/pacifist without moralizing; counter-reading of forced harmony lingers via blood-bright blooms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with distinct perceptual signature (roses blooming on blood spots, canvas like mother's hands); rhythmic lyricism modulates from quiet pressure to charged dawn poise, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("engraved quiet," "inculcating plants") taught early as texture; rhythm varies read-aloud, propels via image-stacked sentences; zero loops obscure closure's pulse-hearing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of horticultural philosophy grafting literal scrap into living memorial transforms grief tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via irreplaceable rose-weaving, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
