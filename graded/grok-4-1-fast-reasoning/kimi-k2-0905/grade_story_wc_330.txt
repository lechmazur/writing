<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority peaks in "throat ached with a lifetime of swallowed words," revealing contradictory disbelief and drive; micro-choices like kneeling compel the earned singing with visible cost of internalized promise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure: fragment dissolves "into the final chord... sank into his chest," reweighting silence with solitary persistence cost legible in final walk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Pool "mirrored the sky so perfectly he stepped onto the surface expecting to fall upward" constrains choice and charges climax image; sensory details like "vines threading down like green notes" evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to interpret silence tightens accumulatively to kneeling and singing, narrowing options with embodied cost; agency in purposeful wrong turn forecloses doubt under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence as "unopened mouth" emerges from particulars like wooden neigh and memory-notes, resonant CR in final image reconfigures premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in carpenter's notices ("wooden nostrils flared"); rhythmic lyrical voice modulates hush to singing without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (hush, gleam) taught early; rhythm varies in climax "silver dust settling onto the pool," propels to charged closure without loops or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of circus decay and memory-song transforms tropes; carpenter's "carving no wood, yet every footfall left a carousel note" risks poetic boldness heightening stakes organically.</comment>
