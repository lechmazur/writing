<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garnet's motivation roots deeply in the "cradle of sparks," driving micro-choices like deceiving Voss with a false surge; contradictory obedience vs. rebellion acts simultaneously in that beat. Final unmasking earns change through prior risks. No unearned epiphanies; embodied in heart-drumming tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: sundial codes → graphite lockpick → generator bridge → chain-room relay → barge release as DC closure with discovery-risk cost legible in Voss confrontation. Orientation anchors in first paragraph. Single tightening via Voss suffices; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Blackout and fort mechanisms constrain every choice, from moth-wing footsteps to copper coils; quill holder as micro-setting charges final raised-candle image. Sensory hush and cool iron filter through Garnet's rebel bias. No white-room; evolves with rekindled lights.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silent revolution stake signals early, tightens via Voss reversal narrowing options; agency in graphite coaxing and false report forecloses exposure path with on-page cost. Causal escalation coheres to barge-drift payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obedience-to-invention theme emerges via sparks/light motifs shifting from internal cradle to fort-wide beacon, reweighting tyranny in unmasking image without statement. Subtext in conspirator winks invites ambiguity on costs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: rebel lens on "murdered torch" and drifting swans. Lyrical rhythm modulates tension; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("aim them at the chain-room"). No head-hopping; diction fits inventive worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but figurative density ("bruised violet," "tongues of flame") borders overwrite in Voss beat without harm to closure. No loops/artifacts; strong verbs anchor propulsion. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis: graphite quill as lockpick/spanner/beacon transforms ministry relic into revolution tool, risking bold steampunk world without retreat. Fresh cradle motif heightens stakes organically.</comment>
