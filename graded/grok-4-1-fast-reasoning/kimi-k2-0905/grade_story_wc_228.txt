<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied memory ("tasted salt though no blood") and micro-choices like entering the cleft, earning the final transference; contradictory aloofness vs. engagement acts in the shell-copying beat. Final renunciation forecloses return with felt cost of empty hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern of shattering/reflection to hidden preservation; orientation anchored in first paragraph; CR closure in wedging shell/canvas reconfigures loss with conceptual cost of "temporary eternity" legible in final emergence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cave network constrains via dim plankton light for painting and fissure for hiding, charging final image; sensory details (mineral breath, salt sweat) filter through painter's bias, evolving with journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving quay deepens accumulatively through shell discovery and self-portrait realization; agency in wrong turn and hiding forecloses paths with cost of abandonment, legible in empty-handed bus departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of art's temporary eternity emerges organically from shell's impossible mural to hidden canvas; final image resonant reconfiguration answers premise without moralizing, reweighting demolition via preserved perfection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (artistic synesthesia like gulls as saws) with rhythmic modulation; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in charged closure image, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (read-aloud flows from short shocks to breathing lists); coherent metaphors like "cathedral veins" propel without muddle; no loops, even in cave progression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of self-discovered painted shell as eternal quay transforms artist-loss trope; risk in impossible familiarity ("his own brushwork") heightens stakes organically to inevitable CR.</comment>
