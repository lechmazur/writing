<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation in Milo's desperate search and trembling hands with the reed; internal conflict via fractured vision realization shows contradictory impulses. Rosa's cunning subtly pressures via rearrangements. Minor unearned epiphany phrasing like "this was what he'd been searching for" slightly undercuts peak choice cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: plant arrangements build pattern to vision reveal tightening, culminating in CR via spiral garden planting with imperfection cost legible in "rasping wheeze." Orientation anchored early in courtyard post-phoenix. Time jumps legible via "three days," "fourth morning."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Courtyard micro-setting constrains via discarded plants enabling communication; ash, reed, marble eye charge final spiral image. Sensory hierarchy (heat-warped reed singing, fogged goggles) reflects artisan priorities. Phoenix ash cyclones evolve causally to colored rain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (color via phoenix fragments) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through trade and discordant vision, narrowing to imperfect beauty acceptance. Cost felt in "screaming hues" and deliberate smashing foreclosing perfection path. Minor abstractness in stakes declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of broken beauty emerges organically via reed fractures, smashed glass, spiral; final planting reweights premise non-literally with "we are most alive where we are broken." Subtext in silent plant dialogue avoids moralizing. Resonant CR in travelers' echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Poetic voice with perceptual bias (Milo's colorless world) modulates to fractured hues; minor head-hopping in "Rosa watched... as she realized" disrupts focalization. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("Trade you"). Rhythmic control in lyric beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short punches in vision reveal). Minor overwriting in stacked figures like "veined with hairline fractures that caught the light like frost" risks muddle in peak beat, but no loops or scaffolds obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phoenix myth into artisan barters and plant semiotics; reed-to-vine transformation risks bold, heightens stakes via imperfection cost without gimmick. Non-obvious moral calculus in trading wounds inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
