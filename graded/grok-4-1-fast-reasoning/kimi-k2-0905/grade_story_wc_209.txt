<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and embodied emotion culminate in earned realization ("melt inside her, a slow drip of old grief"); micro-choices like pinning postcards and painting panes reveal values under seasonal pressure. Contradictory impulses in waiting versus acting build to closure renunciation with visible cost of leaving. No safety-hedging; flaws in eluding the hush drive inevitable persistence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising from postcards to vines blooming to painted panes; closure as Conceptual Repricing ("become the night") reweights premise with conceptual cost of transformation legible in mailing postcard and departure. Orientation anchored early ("amber pavilion in autumn"); one meaningful deepening (moonflowers uncoiling) suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pavilion's copper ribs and amber panes constrain choices (painting directly onto them) and charge final image (glass singing with indigo vines); sensory details like "frost settle on her eyelashes" and "perfume of rotting leaves" evolve causally with seasons, mirroring internal thaw. POV bias filters ginkgo trees and snow as cathedral elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding night blooms) signaled early and deepens accumulatively through winter's pressure to moonflower opening, narrowing to realization with felt cost (grief's "slow drip"); agency in arranging branches and painting forecloses inaction path. Escalation coherent under lens with one decisive intensification at vines' uncoiling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of shadow-rooted bloom emerges organically from particulars (postcard message to painted vines), reweighting via final image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer ("dark remembers what the day forgets") ties to arc. Ambiguity lingers in open question to travelers, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (branches as "lead, the sky the colored glass") modulates rhythmically with intensity; stable close-third POV biases toward artistic hush. Compression and elision taught early (postcards' layers) pay off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in varied syntax ("moonflower vines uncoiling... buds shut tight like small fists"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—indigo veins glow coherently. Rhythmic control heightens seasonal cadence without overwriting in peak (vines opening).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artist reckoning seasons as cathedral glass transforms artist-muse trope; risk-taking in accumulative lyric structure heightens stakes via temporal constraint, inevitable in hindsight at "painted panes kept blooming." Bold, non-obvious premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
