<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in resisting own burden until grotto tightens, compelling confession with embodied cost (finger cut, blood drop); micro-choices like tilting burner reveal values hierarchy; voice specificity via fractal perceptions elevates without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sheets/threads builds to confession's pattern break, yielding RR (Charged Poise) as space unfolds with cost (hollow where burden was); orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Bronze tiles, pool, etched floor constrain choices (needs flame, orientation) and charge closure (starlight shaft, petals peeling); sensory hush presses like whalebone, mirroring internal density; POV bias filters recursively without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weave lattice vs. grotto seizing) signaled early, tightens via resistance and sputter, forcing agency (confession); cost unmistakable in blood-flame flare foreclosing entrapment; lens escalation via density reweighting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of balanced burdens emerges organically from weaving others then own, resonant in forgiving reflections and hollow release without moralizing; final weave rising reweights premise non-literally; ambiguity in fractal infinity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in recursive/metal imagery (e.g., "every direction felt like forward"); rhythmic modulation builds pressure to violet flare; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; figurative coherence (folding, calcifying) pattern-taught without muddle, though minor density saturation in descriptive beats slightly slows propulsion before confession.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh fractal-weaving premise transforms grief collection into recursive lattice with bold risk (boundary-less grotto, blood rite); synthesis inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via shingled hush's evolution.</comment>
