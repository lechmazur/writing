<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority via patchwork body parts under pressure, with contradictory impulses (obey calls vs. realize self as offering) culminating in earned dissolution at "She stepped into the center."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as motifs density-build to CR closure ("she breathed it in, becoming the place"); cost legible in "stitched seams loosened"; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Censer foot and dish constrain choices (placed at center, moonlight tilts it) and charge final image ("crumbled to green dust"); sensory hierarchy reflects navigator's map-biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reverse geography of loss) deepens via calls' instructions narrowing to self-sacrifice; agency in "spoke into the censer foot"; cost unmistakable in body unravelling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of loss-as-geography emerges implicitly via shifting dunes/rooftops; resonant CR in "folds into a country you can finally walk across without bleeding," reweighting without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (geographic metaphors like "veins begging for a heart") with rhythmic modulation under stress; stable close third-person, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to closure; purposeful figurative pattern (bronze ringing, mercury weeping) taught early without muddle, though peak-beat density borders overwrite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of body-as-map and reverse migration transforms tropes; risk in lyric escalation ("dunes began to shift backward") heightens stakes organically.</comment>
