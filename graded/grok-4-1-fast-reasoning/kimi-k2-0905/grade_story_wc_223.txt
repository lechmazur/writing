<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the lace-noose vow (benevolently ruthless preservation), earning the final shared walk with Kestrel; Mara's crisis-actor past roots real choices like spelling "Adel." Kestrel's unrehearsed line reveals growth from staged to authentic. Flawless under pressure, no safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds from walking sentences to chess-words interplay, culminating in Charged Poise closure—the shadow-only final sentence with gallery satisfaction and carried board (missing pawns as living gaps). Orientation anchored early (palace clocks, gallery, chessboard). Cost legible in "useless now" rifle and eclipsed truths.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gallery's "stone mouths" and "iron and lilac" constrain via whispers responding to walks, charging chessboard reprise; lace, boot, knight mane tactile and lived-in. Sensory hierarchy (taste, carved sharpness) mirrors Mara's priorities. Micro-setting (chess squares, lantern edges) guides every choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve gestures vs. patrol erasure) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Kestrel's entry/kick to shared spelling/chess extension till dawn; agency in micro-choices (knight pickup, muzzle placement) forecloses violence with relational cost ("first real thing"). Escalation driven by their invented rules, pressure coherent to poised end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of small gestures' luminous absence emerges via chess hierarchies and walked names, reweighted non-literally in final eclipsed sentence and internalized penumbra. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "gaps only the living could fill." Protagonist arc inextricable from history's ruthless benevolence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (footsteps as wingbones, stone vowels); voice rhythmic and biased toward archival patterns. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Tell me the name"), goal-driven. No head-hopping, compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: varied syntax accelerates from whispers to overlapped steps; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors (e.g., "moat of letters" purposeful). Minor figurative density in opening fits taught lyric pattern without obscuring peak chess-walk cadence. Read-aloud rhythm flawless to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess-as-city, walked alphabet histories, and gesture-archiving transforms interregnum tropes; risk in "nomadic penumbra" internalized as moving eclipse heightens stakes organically. No echoes, bold closure word-shape inevitable from prior patterns.</comment>
