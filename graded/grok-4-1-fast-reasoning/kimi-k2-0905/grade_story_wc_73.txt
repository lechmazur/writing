<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's grim optimism drives micro-choices like prime-leap counting and blood-smearing, earning the closure renunciation; contradictory climb-panic impulses act in the faltering-staircase beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from dice rolls to blood-ripple CR, with legible cost in self-erasure; anchors clear at opening line, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Staircase constrains all tactics (e.g., palm-press shivers wall), dice charge final image; sensory hierarchy (clatter, cool stone, velvet air) filters through math-biased POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture texture) tightens via chipped-dice edge-balance reversal, agency in blood-sigma act forecloses climbing-path with self-loss cost on final convulsion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Regret-as-recursive theme emerges organically from dice asymmetry and sigma blood, resonant CR in staircase-forgetting reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with math-perceptual signature (prime counts, sigma symbol); rhythmic compression peaks in "heart ticking like a gear with a missing tooth."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel to closure; no loops, purposeful metaphors (rusted hinges laugh) integrate without muddle in peak blood-ripple beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh math-dice-staircase synthesis transforms infinite-trap trope; risk in negative-step count heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via blood-key lodged dice.</comment>
