<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—mute preservation versus cracking heart sync—act in calibration and comet beats; final wordless wedge to boy earns renunciation with cost of empty pockets and perpetual silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from ice insertion to comet refraction; CR closure lands in shrinking iceberg and descent, with legible conceptual cost of wonder's fragile frequency ("iceberg shrinking to a pearl of memory").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bluff wind and kinetic ribs constrain calibration choices; iceberg fragment as micro-setting charges comet glow and final after-image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to preserve wonder deepens texturally via calibration density to comet plucking; agency in micro-adjustments yields cost as ice melts, charging endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final wedge to boy offers non-literal answer to wonder's preservation, reweighting silence from absence to resonant cavity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature of metallic shimmer and oscillations persists under comet pressure; rhythmic compression in "ribs rocked, kinetic energy spiraling upward" heightens without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; metaphors like "bow across an infinite viola" cohere and propel high-density calibration without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ice refracting comet into "ribbons of unseen hues" synthesizes tuner, sculpture, and sky into inevitable frequency of wonder; risky lyric risks heighten closure charge.</comment>
