<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Bell ringer's motivation to discover connection's texture drives her question and song leadership, earning transformation with embodied contradiction in tracing the lens; collectors apply vague secondary pressure but remain indistinct archetypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from arrival/question to dismantling/song spiral, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure when she leaves the lens behind, reweighting preservation into creation with legible conceptual cost in the final offering image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Carbide lamp lens functions as micro-setting, handled across beats to fracture light forward and charge closure image at spiral's heart; golden shadows recur selectively to mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming lost sounds tightens via bell ringer's gong-like question pausing collectors, forcing agency in spiral/song that forecloses mourning with felt cost of abandoning bells and fragments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformation over mourning emerges organically from question/dismantling/song, answered non-literally in lab's reconfiguration and lens offering; resonant final image reweights silence as music without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with sound-biased perceptual signature; prose rhythm modulates from descriptive arrival to propulsive song, with purposeful poetic compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory action with motif recurrence like golden shadows; minor paraphrase loops in lab naming and questioning phrasing slightly dull mid-beats but don't obscure closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh post-grid sound ecology synthesizes loss into artificial pilgrimage bridge; risk-taking in lyric transformation of lab via broken chimes/spiral feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
