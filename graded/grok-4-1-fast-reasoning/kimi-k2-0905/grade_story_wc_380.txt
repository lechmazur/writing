<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miren's motivation rooted in sister's deletion drives all actions, with embodied emotion in "lingering tremor in her hands" revealing cost. Micro-choices like whispering date and laying flowers show values under pressure. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pier gravity to chamber memories emerging "like minnows," culminating in CR closure ("now she knew where to look") with legible cost in crumbling flowers and dissolving gravity. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph. Single scene with fluid movement fits scope; pattern taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Salt crystal chamber and gravity pockets constrain steps ("pulling her steps into strange arcs") and charge final image ("gravity here felt kinder"). Sensory details selective via POV urgency, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting as recurring object elevates to 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover memories) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to chamber climax where memories prove intangible, forcing endurance with cost ("fingers passed through"). Escalation via density reweights options; one deepening sufficient. Agency in ritual choices drives to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memories sinking "into places where the world's rules grow thin" emerges organically from particulars, reweighted in final image of "sister's laughter settle into her bones... as ballast" without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer to deletion's fate; ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature: biased noticing of "salt crystal... bent light into slow, breathing rainbows." Rhythmic control modulates with pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "flowers... began to absorb... petals regaining the bruised purple"); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwriting in metaphors like "memories emerged like minnows" risks coherence in peak beat but pattern-consistent. No loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of beached whales carrying deleted memories via gravity/salt logic feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in world rules heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation of tropes (whale carcass, lost sibling) through specific physics and ritual. Final reconfiguration ("gravity remained, a gentle distortion") elevates.</comment>
