<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's blindness creates embodied struggle, paralleling drone's "Morse of fear" in jitter; micro-choices like water ripples earn her final patch as healing reconfiguration with village cost felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via spectral shifts to Charged Poise closure: drone's "perfect silver arc" reweights chaos-to-balance with legible deadline cost in "seven minutes" warning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Suspended drippers and rain barrel constrain diagnosis/climax choices, evolving from "jagged rainbow" to "moving halos" to charge final flight image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (village seeds) tightens accumulatively via jitter reversal, forcing agency in ripple fix; cost unmistakable in Col's clock warnings narrowing to harbor departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of decoding feedback emerges via repair-self parallel, final "tiny artificial star" reweighting blindness premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with tactile/perceptual signature ("magnetic calm," refracted light); minimal dialogue natural, Col's reports goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm accelerates to "shot toward the harbor"; coherent metaphors (iron filings, rainbows) taught early, no loops dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Blind refraction repairs transform artisan trope ingeniously; drone-veins/ripples synthesis inevitable, risking synesthesia for fresh closure charge.</comment>
