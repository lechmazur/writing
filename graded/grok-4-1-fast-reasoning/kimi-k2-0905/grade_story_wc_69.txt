<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's embodied rage as "distant drone" subtracted via rosette reveals contradictory impulses acting in scene; final voice sacrifice earned by prior grief-tinged choices with personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds from syllable collection to city heartbeat rearranging; CR closure via crumbling rosette reconfigures hatred as subtractable noise with legible silence cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Velvet library and rosette constrain listening choices (drinks lamplight, accepts scale); stained-glass nave charges final dust-circle image mirroring internal harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake of unlearning hatred tightens via root-tone lack forcing voice sacrifice, narrowing options under accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in permanent silence and rosette's crumble.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of harmony via subtraction emerges from rosette's pure intervals and books exhaling banned lullabies; final image reweights premise as "note that did not belong" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with sonic-biased perception ("frequencies anger forgets," "moth wings") stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from humming to dawn hush without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion (spines loosening scents) with varied rhythms; zero loops or scaffolds, figuratives coherent in peak subtraction beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zither rosette as absence-vessel transforms choir-harmony trope into acoustic unlearning; lyric risk crystallizes inevitability in dust circle without gimmickry.</comment>
