<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character motivation rooted in celestial charting evolves convincingly to ritual participation, with embodied emotions (chest ache, bones vibrating) and earned change via feather inheritance; internal conflict subtle in observer-to-partner shift but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak rite.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to Charged Poise closure in final ascent and paper bird ignition, reconfiguring belonging with felt cost (torn atlas, internalized rhythm); orientation anchored early, one continuous scene holds without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains choices (unflooded corridor, catwalk valve, moon-pipes) and charges final image (descending photons); sensory details (silver bubbles, cedar-ozone scent) filtered through astrologer's priorities, mirroring exile without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn belonging before sunrise) signaled early, tightens via ritual deepening under Accumulative lens, forcing agency (exhale into pipe) with legible cost (potential stranding, atlas torn); single intensification suffices but lacks micro-reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal belonging emerges organically from feather rite and copepod illumination, with final paper bird offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting exile; no moralizing, ambiguity in "promise to return" lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (celestial-water fusion) modulates rhythm under pressure; stable single POV, purposeful compression taught early pays off in closure image; ghost's pulsed dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, varied rhythm passes read-aloud; figurative language coherent and pattern-driven (inverted rainfall, luminous respite) without muddle, though occasional long sentences slightly slow peak catwalk climb.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrologer-birdman rite in drowned orrery transforms tropes via specifics (copepods as fireflies, breath flares); risk-taking in lyric ritual heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at paper bird ignition.</comment>
