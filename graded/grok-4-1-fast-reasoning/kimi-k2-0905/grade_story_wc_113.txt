<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority rooted in liminal musician's trap ("trapped between the pit and the stage") drives micro-choices like clutching the program and descending, earning final embrace of disruption with embodied cost; minor slip in tidy epiphany layering but impulses contradict in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as water-damaged images densify pattern to CR closure ("sheet music... transformed into something new" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of eternal disruption); orientation anchored early, one tightening via hidden door suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Flooded setting constrains choices (wading debris, water parting) and charges final image (receding water reveals stage); sensory hierarchy (ripples, pulsing ink, lantern flickers) reflects musician's acoustic bias without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unravel code tightens accumulatively via page revelations and descent, forcing renunciation of expected harmony; agency in following ghost culminates in playing "spaces between" with felt cost, legible in final emergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unsung power in disruptions emerges organically from ink images shifting to embrace "water-damaged pages of life"; final non-literal image reweights premise without moralizing, resonant via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (acoustics-through-water, between-notes) modulates rhythmically under pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible to charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful metaphors (ink "bloom[ing]" to flip-book) cohere without muddle, propelling to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost trope via water-damaged program code and between-spaces for pit musicians; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
