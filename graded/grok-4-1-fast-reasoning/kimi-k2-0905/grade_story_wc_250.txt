<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of silent empathy via tears "slid to the corners of her mouth," earning closure's endurance with visible cost tied to child's loss; interiority concrete and contradictory without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds to helix CR; "folded the reflection back onto itself" lands on-page reconfiguration with emotional cost in tears and dimming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt dock planks and shutters from "wrecked barges" constrain weaving choices and charge helix image; sensory hierarchy (ripples, fog) filtered through guardian's perceptual priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of teaching darkness tightens accumulatively via adjustments to "final adjustment"; agency in dimming lantern forecloses brighter path, crystallizing cost on skin and tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emergent theme of darkness cradling light reweights via "nursing it like an ember it had forgotten"; resonant CR answers silent empathy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in light patterns; "air seemed to fold inward, spiralingly calm" teaches lyric compression, paid off rhythmically at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or artifacts; high density in "starlight dripped through the gaps, sketching a slow helix" propels multi-job across character/action/image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guardian weaving starlight into darkness via mirror/shutters feels inevitable; bold lyric risk heightens stakes in helix recognition.</comment>
