<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait embodied in wince at gull and palm against inscribed stone, compelling higher-stakes direct inscription at dome; final endurance of sealing personal confession earned via prior note rituals with felt cost in lighter inkwell.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as note placements densify pattern to dome's void, yielding CR closure in final realization that separations are foundations; cost legible in "weight now lighter by exactly the amount of a confession."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Water lapping ankles and wet marble steps constrain descent and wading choices; recurring arches/ribs as code of hollows charge final coping emergence, filtered through Mara's professional gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ritual documentation vs. salvation duty tightens accumulatively through escalating fissures to direct inscription, narrowing options; agency in spatula pries and lime seals forecloses with inkwell's depletion as visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interlaced absences emerge as theme via filled crevices shifting to personal bruise on stone, resonant non-literal answer in final image reweighting separations as foundations needing care.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("code of hollows," "hush of arches") stable in single POV, rhythm modulates from descent echoes to hushed blaze cadence without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "suture... thread made of light" coherent and purposeful, no loops; rhythm propels from "boots kissing wet marble" to final rung-as-sentence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveyor embedding confessions transforms ruin trope; risk in lyric accumulation of absences heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight via dome eye-void.</comment>
