<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied details like "trembling hands" and "salt on his lips," with contradictory stubbornness compelling descent and final acceptance; minor abstraction in epiphanies like "unpaid debt to the departed" borders on unearned without full micro-choice friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via escalating discoveries (catalog, book, repair); Charged Poise closure at "Accepting, he positioned himself at the circulation desk" reconfigures life with legible cost (tethered ankle, own name in book).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via "pulse blooming within the glass" guiding to northeast aisle and dome bezel; barnacled marble and silt evolve tactilely, charging final "column of chased stillness" image through POV-mortuary filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revitalize lens) deepens accumulatively through catalog guidance to paper boats burning memories (visible cost); agency peaks in repair, narrowing to acceptance with entrapment trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of rest's address emerges organically from soul-books to signals scattering "like new constellations"; final image non-literally answers via undertaker's self-burial, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (funeral parallels in "spines aligned like processional candles"); rhythmic modulation builds to closure poise, purposeful surreal compression taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops; figurative layering ("fire translated grief into light") coherent in peaks but dense enough to slightly blur propulsion in discovery beats without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original underwater soul-library synthesis transforms tropes via undertaker's mortuary lens; bold surreal risks like "books breathing underwater" heighten stakes, inevitable in hindsight at self-naming closure.</comment>
