<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via hands' precise folds mirroring past craft; final departure earns change from preservation obsession with visible cost in abandoning tools. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "lesson she had learned about withering and blooming" borders unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through figure placements culminating in CR closure where final origami reconfigures grief with emotional cost in departure image ("carrying loss not as a burden but as the material"). Orientation anchored early; pattern taught without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Observatory's chambers constrain placements, eyepiece/curtains charge discoveries; tactile vellum dissolution and curtain glow evolve to final constellation image. Sensory hierarchy craft-filtered (vellum edges, candlelight sparks); no white-room, all purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (grief transformation) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via coordinate-moments recalling daughter, tightening to final figure's departure choice foreclosing preservation path. Agency in placements/endurance legible; cost felt in "change from preservation to celebration."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformed memorials emerges via jewelry-to-origami shift, resonating in final constellation without overt moral. Borders Thematic Echo in closing "essential truth" articulation, pulling from peak resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature: craft-biased noticing (folds' precision, vellum pliability); rhythmic texture modulates subdued intensity without drift. No elision or head-hopping; diction coherent to grief-poet voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, motifs like coordinates integrate without loops; minor paraphrase in repeated "coordinates led not to a location but to a moment." Elevated figurative layering purposeful for accumulative mode, no muddle at closure constellation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of soul-tracking observatory and origami memorials transforms grief tropes; coordinates-as-moments inflect non-obviously from tattoo stencil to constellation payoff. Risky lyric structure heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
