<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Serene poise and ink-stained embodiment ground motivation; reversal via puppets earns final commitment to "letter with questions," revealing elitism flaw with patronage cost, though epiphanies lean conceptual over fully contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from stick ignition to puppets' life reversal; CR closure lands in ash-ink manifesto-writing on dome with finger-burn pain as legible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dome's rusted panels and ghost receivers constrain writing visible to satellites, charging closure gallery image; moonlight half-lit motif mirrors internal tension purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant ethical neutrality stake deepens accumulatively via puppets' subversive retelling narrowing to "hold space for smoke"; agency in reversal and burn forecloses elitist path with felt patronage regret and physical pain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of friction between truths emerges via smoke/puppets reversal; final manifesto quotes thesis directly ("We are all puppets..."), docking for explicit articulation replacing pure image-resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with calligraphic perceptual signature ("syllables reversing like calligraphy strokes undone"); rhythmic syntax modulates contemplative intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied syntax and integrated sensory images; dense figurative language ("smoke curl into equations of regret") fits textural lens but borders overwriting in reversal peak without stronger sparsity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic-real stick-reversal in radar dome yields inevitable CR on ethical ambiguity; risk-taking in puppet visions heightens stakes organically.</comment>
