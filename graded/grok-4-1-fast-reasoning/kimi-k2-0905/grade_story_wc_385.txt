<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in mother's disappearance compels descent and closure choice; interiority concrete via tasting blood memory and embodied curse of grief. Minor abstraction in epiphany ("unfinished departures loop") slightly dilutes contradictory impulses in pivotal cocoon moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory echoes and motifs densify to nexus discovery and closure via earned farewell song. Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page ("cocoon dissolved into motes... her voice; the cliffs absorbed and released it"); conceptual cost of freeing loops legible in fading echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharp (scent of wet copper, taste of iron, reed notes); serpentine nexus constrains descent and charges shell fusion image. Final rim song under starlight mirrors internal release via environmental absorption.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finish echo to avoid trapping) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via questioning echo and mother's words, foreclosing looping path. Agency in progressive singing bears cost of confrontation; minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of completed goodbyes emerges organically from echoes/moths/particulars; final image ("song... fade into open sky") reconfigures premise without moralizing. Moth-silk cocoon reprise shifts meaning from entrapment to release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (sound as taste/silk); voice modulates rhythmically, lyric compression taught early via shell whispers. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual in old woman's lines advancing closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels descent; purposeful "reed-blown" motif avoids loops. Minor overwriting in canyon webs ("braided into webs... tightened... loosened") risks coherence but ties to closure without obscuring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic folklore (moths weaving voices, shell nexus) transforms echo trope via perceptual rules; risk in lyric structure heightens closure resonance. Cocoon reveal feels inevitable from patterned echoes.</comment>
