<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spinner's wistful fingers-to-bead sacrifice reveals contradictory impulses toward memory and connection; crushing "the grit of ancient resin" embodies earned muteness with visible cost on pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as puzzle assembly deepens to portal's "bargain," yielding resonant reconfiguration of silence with swallowed name's cost legible in final stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bamboo grove and lichened trunks constrain box discovery ("foot struck something half-buried"); orchard's renewal charges closure image of "trees grew younger."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to bridge distance escalates via voice-bargain, agency in bead-swallow foreclosing speech; orchard's "exhaled a chord" makes cost visceral under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Silence-as-thread reconfigures memory's maps without statement; golden sap beads offer resonant answer to sacrifice's cycle, reweighting orchard's hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("shuttle clacked like a second heart") biases toward tactile hush; rhythmic control heightens sacrifice without distance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("yarn itself wanted to speak"); coherent metaphors like "cooling iron" avoid muddle in peak bead-crush beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Puzzle-becomes-portal and voice-to-thread synthesize fresh memory cartography; risk of lyric sacrifice heightens stakes in "messages waiting for the next puzzle."</comment>
