<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between janitorial duty and spiritual kneeling act in scene, earning the final chest-opening renunciation with embodied grief as "soft meteor." Interiority particular through meteor lullaby and visionary empathy. Final change credible via nightly build.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of nightly reflections builds to Perseids vision as RR/CR, with cost in lantern's transparency and traded glow legible on-page. Orientation anchored early in dome arrival. No shards exceed scope; visionary ellipsis motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lantern glass as micro-setting constrains choices (tracing paths, touching fleck) and charges final shard image half-buried in pine needles. Sensory hierarchy biased to cosmic dust motes and warm fleck. Dome evolves from rusty silence to open welcoming.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of orbital litter guilt tightens accumulatively to vision's meteor question, forcing vulnerability trade-off; cost felt in wept realization and dome-left-behind. Agency in nightly whispering forecloses isolation path. One deepening via charcoal fleck suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Meteor's primal question—"being small enough to burn was the same as being brave enough to change"—reweights premise non-literally in transparent lantern and heart afterimage. Theme emerges from particulars without moralizing. Counter-reading lingers in open door legacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable with perceptual signature in star-sigh whispers and iron dialects; rhythm modulates from hush to vision pulse. Compression taught early via lantern hoarding, paid in traded glow. No head-hopping; diction biases cosmic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "dust motes drifted like miniature galaxies" weaves action; rhythm varies read-aloud. Figurative cluster in vision ("black water," "shattered nursery") coherent and pays off without muddle. Minor metaphor density in peak but pattern-integrated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor premise synthesizes observatory abandonment with meteor empathy non-obviously; lantern's dying-star sigh transforms trope boldly. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens fragility stakes, inevitable in yellow heart afterimage.</comment>
