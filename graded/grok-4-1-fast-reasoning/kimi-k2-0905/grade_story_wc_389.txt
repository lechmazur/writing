<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when Elara laughs at the warning lyric ("The dawn you shape will cast shadows sharp enough to cut") while hovering over enter, earning her erasure-choice with embodied cost; interiority particular via oil-stains and fever-backstory anchor. Flawless single-POV execution elevates to exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as static densities build to portico manifestation and CR closure; Elara's dissolution into transmission delivers undeniable conceptual cost (self-erasure haunting futures) in final beat. Orientation anchors early; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Observatory dome and pressing clouds constrain timing as "storm peaked," charging final image; lightning "stuttering flashes" mirrors internal fragmentation purposefully. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's bias toward static over world below.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (broadcast shadows for new dawn) tightens accumulatively via hovering hand after self-warning lyric, forcing agency with erasure-cost legible on page. Protagonist endurance reconfigures options without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from portico glimpses and final girl hearing "Elara's final laugh," reweighting shadows-as-light premise without moralizing; resonant CR answers allegiance question via particulars. No tidy binaries or echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature via "cobalt glass shards in her mind"; rhythm modulates with pressure (short peak sentences at key-hit). Purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at dissolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (clouds "like curious children") without muddle in peak broadcast beat. Rhythmic variety propels to closure image without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio-ghosts as collapsed futures transforms prophetic trope; self-erasure risk heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via early static allegiance. Bold lyric structure coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
