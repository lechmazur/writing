<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solid interiority via embodied iron taste and contradictory impulses to hide yet share song with Mr. Blackwood; final escape earned by trust-building balancing acts. Minor summary in "night after night" dilutes some micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density tightening from chip-hiding to constables' raid; CR closure in dust motes/sky-quilt reconfigures preservation with erasure cost legible in abandoned chip.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Skylight dust motes constrain initial balancing and recharge final image as unfinished cadence; sensory selectivity (camphor, iron) mirrors POV urgency perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of song-preservation tightens accumulatively via loft-building alliance and raid evasion; agency in migratory release forecloses static hiding with conceptual cost in fragmented dispersal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of migratory survival emerges from pigeon-carried measures without statement; sky-quilt image resonantly reweights erasure premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in musical metaphors ("slow arpeggios," "oil-drop eyes") sustains under pressure; stable close-third POV with purposeful compression pays off in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Figurative density ("dust motes in slow arpeggios") risks overwriting in opening beat, dulling propulsion; "learning to trust again across learning to trust again" loops redundantly. Rhythm varies effectively elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pigeon-sheet melodies and meteorite-lullaby etch fresh synthesis of smuggling/memory/sci-fi; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
