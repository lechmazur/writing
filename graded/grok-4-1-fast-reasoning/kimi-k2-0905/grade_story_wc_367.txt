<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivation rooted in geas via cracked laugh compels escalating choices like pressing wick against lens; contradictory impulses (steer night vs. birth sunrise) act simultaneously; final shift to reader earned by wick's consumption with embodied cost in her chest's afterimage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as image density builds to CR closure (lighthouse dissolves, Lirael sows prophecies) with conceptual cost legible in "dew that had never known ink"; orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emerald lens as recurring object constrains choices (turns autonomously, thins to membrane) and charges final image; sensory details (groaning whale, salt air sliced) filtered through herald's priorities; post-print world evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape dawn via shadows) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via laugh echoes and wick ignition narrowing to erasure of stars; agency in shadowed laugh and helm-turn forecloses paths with on-page cost (wick vanishes).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of stories reborn from print's death emerges organically via drifting jellyfish headlines and final "shadow the first letter"; resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing; complexity in prophecy's accidental burden lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (print-as-ash, light-as-ink) modulates rhythm under pressure; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in charged poise; diction reflects herald's shadowed routine.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with metaphors (green fire corridors, black flame) purposeful and pattern-taught, propelling via varied rhythm; minor mixed vehicle ("whale remembering harpoons forged from obsolete type") slightly strains peak clarity but no loops dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-print apocalypse with lighthouse as story-sail transforms tropes via geas-laughter; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes to CR without gimmick; inevitable hindsight from routine's breakage.</comment>
