<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivation rooted in brother's death and moon-syncing compels thoughtful micro-choices like gloves and lullaby, earning change with felt cost in heavier heart. Guards and Seris apply pressure via named fears, revealing flaws without stereotypes. Minor slip: internal conflict more harmonious than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from drawer pull to knots/rope cast, culminating in CR closure where mist lifts and forgiveness widens space via absence, cost legible in "palms empty yet heavier." Single scene oriented early (parapet, Greyreach Bay); one tightening via ritual hush suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Storm-worn parapet in mist constrains (stone bites skin, wind forbids chains) and charges final image (wider stone, lifted mist revealing coastlines). Sensory hierarchy (salt/regret in coat, moon pulse in stone) reflects Kael's priorities; evolves causally with thunder/mist/rope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exchange without victory, recycle mistakes) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fear-naming, lullaby, knots tightening to rope cast that forecloses grievance path. Agency in Kael's pauses/humming; cost in untethered rope vanishing without splash, altering cannons' aim.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as "space widened by absence" emerges organically from knots/rope, drawer pull reprise; final image ("two coastlines no longer aiming cannons") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting mistakes into wisdom without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV on Kael with perceptual signature (objects remember rhythm like moon/tide); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Seris's question, Kael's futures/not ledgers). Rhythmic control modulates hush to silence, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors coherent/pattern-taught (mist as dungeon wall, ink as squid grief) without muddle in peak (rope cast). Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; no loops, scaffold, or overwriting touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ritual knots/ moon pulse transform prisoner exchange trope into fresh forge of mistakes; bold lyric risks (drawer pull as borrowed bone) heighten stakes coherently, inevitable in hindsight via widened parapet.</comment>
