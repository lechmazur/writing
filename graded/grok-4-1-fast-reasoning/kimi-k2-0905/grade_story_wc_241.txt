<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's interior contradiction—refusing to see her father fully yet following his scrawls—manifests in embodied micro-choices like sitting with the lantern and annotating pages, earning her final openness. Flawless single-POV execution with flawed renunciation at closure. Minor therapy-speak ("widen perspectives responsibly") tugs from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scrawls → book → mirrors realization builds density to CR closure ("She bet on herself") with emotional cost legible in scratched pane and unlit candle. Orientation anchors by para 2; one tightening via diary suffices. No slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens via scents (wet stone, clover melancholy) mirroring internal thaw; lantern as micro-setting constrains choices and charges final image ("scratched: 'For the next exception'"). POV-filtered details evolve causally with rain pausing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interpret riddles responsibly) deepens accumulatively via discoveries narrowing refusal-to-see blind spot; agency in subway traversals forecloses isolation with openness cost felt in leaving annotated pages. One tightening charges poise without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of lucid contradictions emerges via particulars (scrawls as mirrors, clovers shifting from trap to guide), culminating in non-literal CR repricing "refuse to see" without moralizing. Final image reweights premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual bias toward scents/fractures, rhythmic control modulates from melancholy density to charged cadence ("not lighter, but wider"). Stable close-third POV; purposeful compression taught early pays at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("The rainwashed library... clung"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figs in peak (diary read). Minor register elevation in places but voice-consistent; closure image crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gambler-riddles inheritance transforms trope via clover/scrawl lattice; risk in lyric accumulative closure heightens nuance without gimmick.</comment>
