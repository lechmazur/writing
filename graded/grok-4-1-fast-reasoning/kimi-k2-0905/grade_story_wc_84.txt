<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pilgrim's perpetually surprised eyes trait shown consistently through reactions, enabling revelation without antagonism; Mara's motivation rooted in grandmother/parents concretely anchors pursuit, culminating in earned pull of lever with embodied heart-race.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of star images building to Charged Poise closure when printed map sings her name, reconfiguring belonging with felt emotional cost; orientation anchored early in observatory at dusk; single tightening via printing suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sandstone walls glowing amber and broken astrolabe constrain drone landing and printing under dying light, charging final stargazing image; sensory hierarchy (visual stars, tactile iron lever) reflects pilot's bias; dusk evolution mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding belonging signaled early via tracking, tightens accumulatively through chip reveal of parents' frequency, forcing stance crystallization in printing/pull; agency in lever-pull forecloses aimless search with emotional cost legible in song of names.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of frequencies calling missing pieces emerges organically via chip's dancing stars shifting to personal song, resonant non-literal answer in final waypoint realization without moralizing; subtext in pilgrim's explanations layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in drone-pilot details like visor/tablet; dialogue natural/subtextual ("It prints belonging") advances revelation; rhythm modulates with intensity, prose texture distinct in star/light motifs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative stars/light without muddle in peak printing beat; varied rhythm, no loops; minor repetition of "surprised eyes" contained but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Type foundry chip printing living star-maps transforms printing trope into frequency-beloning premise, fresh synthesis inevitable in map's song; risk in surreal mechanics heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
