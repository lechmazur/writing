<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion culminate in shadow confrontation, where contradictory impulses (teaching others vs. own resentment) act simultaneously, earning the final mutual acceptance with visible cost in the crumbling cellar memory restacking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory density builds to shadow's emergence as tightening, yielding Charged Poise closure when Lira's palms meet shadow and it disperses, with cost in the pin's final snap and box abandonment legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Music box as recurring micro-setting constrains choices throughout and charges final image of its silence; sanctuary's breathing walls and reality shifts mirror loosening, filtered through Lira's sensory priorities without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of convincing ghosts tightens via balance demand into personal shadow pressure, driven by Lira's agency (angling box, confronting shadow); cost unmistakable in metabolized bombs and forsaken box under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal release emerges organically from cellular memories and good/harm balance, answered non-literally in silhouettes against forgetting horizon; shadow's blade-sharp question crystallizes complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (vibrations slipping into skin) modulates rhythmically under stress; stable single POV with purposeful surreal compression taught early pays off at closure; shadow's dialogue carries subtext naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, coherent metaphors (jagged pins plucking air); minor overwriting in ghost strawberry beat slightly muddles peak pressure but does not touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cellular memory as pacifist tool in shifting sanctuary transforms war-ghost redemption trope; bold surreal risks heighten stakes, with box's damaged wheel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
