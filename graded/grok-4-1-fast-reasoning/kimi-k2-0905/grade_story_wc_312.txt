<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's earnestly naive traits constrain his lukewarm magic into earnest endurance, earning the final legacy shift; contradictory impulses emerge in clinging to "brittle devotion" despite fizzling spells. Dolphin encounter reveals internal limits under external pressure. Closure renunciation (death) feels motivated by prior micro-choices like counting drops.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via accelerating drip density and pattern breaks (bell rings, then cracks), culminating in CR closure: ocean persists post-death with conceptual cost of fragile belief. Orientation anchored early under viaduct. Time jumps taught via "seven days... years passed" without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct and dawn constrain ritual (bell hanging, light striking), charging final epitaph drip; sensory details like "salt-crusted metal pulse" filter through mage's priorities. Evolving seabed-to-ocean mirrors stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuild via devotion) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through rate-doubling and wave arrival, narrowing to brittle endurance; agency in daily ringing forecloses personal life with aging/death cost legible in "beard turned white... didn’t wake."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brittle devotion theme emerges organically from drip mechanics and legacy handoff, reweighting premise in final CR image ("a drip... every 47 seconds. And every time it does, a fish is born") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward rates/memories; voice rhythm modulates from precise counting to lyrical expansion, consistent under stress. Dolphin dialogue carries subtext ("rebuilt the sea, but not the faith") distinguishing idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("47 seconds. 46. 44") teaching pattern; varied syntax propels without loops or muddled metaphors. Minor register elevation in poetic beats fits mage voice without obscuring closure drip image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of belief-as-physics via dripping rates transforms ocean-vanishing trope; risk in accumulative legacy closure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from naive mage's arc.</comment>
