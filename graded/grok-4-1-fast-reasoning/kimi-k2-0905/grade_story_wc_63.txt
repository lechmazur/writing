<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between village duty and brother's claim act in the pause (fingertips on pendulum), culminating in earned carving of "r" with visible cost (arms burning on wind). Interiority concrete via rake handle's letters and fishhook. No safety-hedging; flaw of diligence drives mutual absolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via inscriptions to CR closure in pendulum's "for-give" knell and brother's field glinting, reweighting debt-measuring premise with undeniable conceptual cost (ridge widening someday). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene with one tightening at pause; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ridge and pendulum constrain choice (hush of pause) and charge final image (obsidian glowing, rake bob clacking retreat). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (salt-machine oil reverie). Details evolve causally (waves thicken post-modification).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forgive brother vs. village clock) signaled early, tightens texturally at pause with agency (carve/lash handle), foreclosing precise time for slackened vow; cost legible in thickened waves and burning arms. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Forgiveness theme emerges from particulars (letter-by-letter carvings to swinging "for-give"), reweighting debt vs. balance in final image of retreating sea and slower villagers without moral. Subtext in villagers' fear vs. seed buckets.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("searing reverie of salt and machine oil") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates with pressure (short sentences at pause). Stable first-person; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (wood dust drifts onto escapement); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language coherent and pattern-taught (obsidian teeth grinding bone to blade turned away), no muddle in peak (carving beat).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock-as-guilt-meter and rake apologies transforms tropes; carving "r" turn inevitable from particulars, risk of lyric compression heightens stakes. Non-obvious moral calculus of mutual absolution.</comment>
