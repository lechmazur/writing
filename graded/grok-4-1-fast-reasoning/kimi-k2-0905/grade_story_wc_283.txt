<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in choosing to unscramble via buttons against the Abbott's declaration; final inversion of "hourglass heart" earned through embodied micro-choices like laying out buttons and restrung spiral, with visible cost of prophecy leak reweighted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from jar quiver to silence spill and button spiral; CR closure lands in final image of widened horizon and jar crack for villager, with conceptual cost of reassembly legible in "every ending is fabric awaiting reassembly."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber warehouse constrains via buttons as witnesses and glowing silence; recurring jar and buttons charge final spiral image, with sensory hierarchy (resinous beams, iron-sage wind) filtered through POV's quiet focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unscramble prophecy) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via uncorking silence that reveals button stories, narrowing to spiral rethreading; agency in restrung choices forecloses fear-path with felt cost in pocketed buttons as reminders.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of shedding/fastening emerges organically from button particulars, reweighted in ending image of "garment we button together"; resonant non-literal answer avoids moralizing, with ambiguity in prophecy counter-pattern lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in textured metaphors ("sand measure out lives like a miser"); stable close third-person POV with rhythmic control heightens silence's hush, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric rhythm; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("dusk’s first blade slid between cliff and horizon") purposeful for tone, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image of glowing warehouse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of buttons as prophetic witnesses transforms prophecy trope; risk-taking in accumulative silence/button pattern heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via spiral's counter-pattern.</comment>
