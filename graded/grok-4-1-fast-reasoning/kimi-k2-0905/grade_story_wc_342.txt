<comment>Prosopagnosia reframed as precise filter drives micro-choices in painting; contradictory impulses peak in realizing "she has been painting her own face after all," earning identity reconfiguration with sanctuary's loss.</comment>
<question>2</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via coin-guided strokes amid vibrations; CR closure in final notch stroke and explosion reconfigures limitation into enduring memory, cost legible in library's last breath.</comment>
<question>3</question>
<grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Curved trunk walls and root-wrapped texts constrain brushwork; vibrations and knothole sun charge painting, mirroring internal urgency in "candle flame dance across her wet paint."</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sky-mirroring stake tightens texturally with siren countdown, forcing accelerated fractal strokes; endurance forecloses completion, cost felt in partial sky's "final flicker."</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Negative space/sky reweights face-blind premise through coin-to-absence progression; final white point as "absence" offers resonant anchor without moralizing, lingering conceptual cost.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature fixates on "shoulders carry invisible weight," fractal diction embodies precision; rhythmic compression heightens stillness-to-explosion pressure seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>High density in "each stroke calculated using the coin's measurements" propels without loops; varied syntax matches urgency, zero artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>

<grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Face-blind sky-painting via reversed Orion coin transforms disability trope organically; fractal negative-space realization risks lyric density, heightening stakes inevitably.</comment>
