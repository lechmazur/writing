<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mapkeeper's motivation rooted in massacre backstory anchors choices like projecting silence image; embodied actions (clutching hush, scoring dome) reveal hierarchy of values. Jalen applies pressure via reckless whisper absorbed by stone. Minor slip: poetic interiority occasionally abstracts emotion over visceral contradiction at Warden beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from augury cracks to dome carving; orientation anchored early via echo chamber veins and caves. On-page RR closure: final crack meets beginning, beings fold with felt cost in strangled song. One tightening via spiral/fork/circle progression narrows to hush bloom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cave micro-setting (stalactites chiming, mineral lace trembling) constrains breaths/actions; ice cracks as recurring tool charge final dome scoring image. Sensory hierarchy reflects silence urgency, narrowing to vibrations/marrow threat. Warden's fossilized chords evolve causally with hush projection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (carry map via hush) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Jalen warning/Warden tremor to dome ritual agency; carving severs paths with vibration betrayal cost legible in flickering voices. Endurance forecloses noisy escape with marrow-spill risk. No reversals needed; density coheres pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence preserving stories emerges via particulars (tidal ridges, stolen voices); final "We were here" whisper reconfigures premise non-literally with memory-cost resonance. Subtext in hush bloom shifts from prayer to weapon. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in post-sky healing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature: silence-patterned noticing (cadence of footsteps, stone heartbeat). Poetic diction/rhythm modulates with intensity (short breaths at pool, scored lines at climax). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual; Jalen's "breathed" words advance via absorption.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety propels (e.g., staccato chisel lines vs. flowing descents); high density integrates image/action. Figurative density in dome beat ("radiant static... strangled by absence") borders overwriting but pattern-taught via hush motif, no muddle. Minor synonym churn in silence variants ("hush, repose") subtracts slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: silence augury vs. devouring beings transforms tropes via ice-crack geometry as tactic; hush bloom as grown weapon risks bold ingenuity. Final stone-crack sigh reweights premise inevitably from survival to legacy.</comment>
