<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction shines in "each footfall blissfully aberrant because the left belonged to the sister who loved heights and the right...prayed for depth," compelling the final recitation; interiority particular and mythic without epiphanies; closure renunciation of separation earned through collected fragments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from porthole to maze center; CR closure in "name too large for one throat but singable by two," reweighting fusion with sinking ship's conceptual cost legible in polite submersion; orientation anchored immediately, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Carnival ship and body-as-setting (sister's face bulging beneath skin) constrain path through rotting plush and mirror-maze, charging carousel roof finale; sensory hierarchy (mildew chord braiding ribs) mirrors mythic urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture name for unity) signaled early, deepens via shard-gathering tightening that narrows to card placement; agency in following/pursuing forecloses separation with ship-sinking cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of fused identity emerges organically from particulars like emerald-matched iris and shared lung; final "garden...not a place but a tense" reconfigures premise non-literally, lingering ambiguity in buoyant sinking without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("sound braided itself into the twin’s ribs like a rope") stable in single POV, rhythmic control heightens mythic texture under pressure; purposeful compression taught early, paid in phosphor vines.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("fog...thickened into pages, turning the bay into an open book"); figurative language patterned and coherent, no loops or muddle touching closure image of emerald lily.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Bold mythic-carnival synthesis transforms chimera trope into fresh garden-as-tense CR; risk of poetic density pays off in inevitable hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
