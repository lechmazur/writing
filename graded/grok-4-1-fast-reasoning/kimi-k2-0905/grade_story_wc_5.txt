<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (almost sparking smile vs. steadying breath) act in the final beat, earning stasis of guardianship with the cost of never leaving; micro-choices like breath-freeing the page reveal patience rooted in grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density (steps, breaths, etchings) tightens to RR closure: scarecrow/orchard beats map the route, with legible cost of stillness as listener in "He knew he would never leave."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Subarctic crater orchard constrains choices (frost-stiff fingers, silence for flash-paper) and charges closure image of trees as "living score"; micro-setting like "rusted pruning shears as compass roses" mirrors internal mapping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to translate heartbeats escalates texturally via fusion and rhythm-mapping, forcing renunciation; cost unmistakable in orchard's hum demanding "stillness requires a listener," crystallizing endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief translated via patterns resonates non-literally in final image: her heart "skipped in recognition," reweighting memory's map with conceptual cost of eternal guardianship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in rhythmic noticing ("counting beats like mile-markers") sustains under pressure; voice modulates from deliberate pause to charged poise without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("while the world holds its breath") taught early as pattern; figurative layering coherent in sealing beat, though dense metaphors slightly thicken propulsion there.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical heartbeat-mapping in crater orchard transforms loss into "vast gramophone"; risk of lyric stasis heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via starlight-plate fusion.</comment>
