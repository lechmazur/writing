<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional: Mara's contradictory inheritance of heroic lies versus quake within drives micro-choices like tracing log discrepancies and angling sundial, earning final renunciation with embodied cost ("lighter and ancient"). Interiority particular and embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of omissions (logs to sundial scratch to journals) tightens to CR closure where tide-soaked realization reconfigures life with new weight, cost legible in "sediment" image and public mission.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sundial and canal constrain choices (coordinate angling, beaching) and charge final image (closed into crate); reeds/bunker mirror internal upheaval purposefully, sensory hierarchy POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. lies) deepens accumulatively via salvage discoveries narrowing options to dismantle; agency in beaching/salvage forecloses inherited path with legible cost in tremor to statues.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of lie-dismantling emerges organically from particulars (dent, smudges, confessions); final barge-turn resonant reconfiguration answers without moralizing, reweighting myths via "wake spreading like a sentence."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (reading ink-smudges "like wind"); voice rhythm modulates serene-to-quake, purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density/propulsion with varied rhythm; "serene upheaval" motif purposeful without muddle, minor figurative density in peak revelation integrated and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of salvage-myth via sundial/log palimpsests transforms trope; radio-silence/beach risk heightens stakes coherently to public-dismantle poise.</comment>
