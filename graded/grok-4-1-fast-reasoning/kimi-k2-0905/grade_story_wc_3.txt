<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (methodical persistence amid cracking voice and blurring eyes) act in scene; final step onto new plank earned by causal chain of her micro-choices like humming lullaby, with visible emotional cost in laughter amid grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as analogical patterns (clangs to glyphs, filings to words) build density to CR closure: arbor extends via etched equation, reconfiguring absence with conceptual cost legible in "velocity over distance is home."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor's iron leaves, humming planks, and filings constrain choices (seed planted in rail joint, quiver into glyphs) and charge final image (new plank forms, horizons extend).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reestablish meaning post-severance) signaled early tightens accumulatively via her agency (transcribe, plant, hum, etch), narrowing to arbor tilt and voice with unmistakable cost in tilted symmetry forcing reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of translating loss into presence emerges organically from particulars (mother's report to final glyph-sentence); ending reweights premise non-literally—"haunted ambitions are just love that hasn’t learned how to change shape"—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (everything rendered as cuneiform signs, e.g., clangs = "sky"/silence="void") stable in third-limited POV; rhythmic control modulates from methodical to resonant laugh at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels (each image advances pattern); figurative language consistent in lyric mode but minor overload in sprout sequence slightly muddles propulsion without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi (magnetic arbor, living mercury) with mythic translation (knowledge seed, haunted ambitions literalized); risk-taking in analogical physics heightens closure inevitability.</comment>
