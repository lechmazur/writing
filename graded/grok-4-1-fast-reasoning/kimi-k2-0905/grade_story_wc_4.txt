<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through embodied acts like soles purple with blossoms and bee sipping salt; motivation to transmute pain drives micro-choices like key into photo heart. Final sharing earned by ritual buildup, revealing whimsy-calmed flaws without safety-hedging. Minor epiphanic whisper ("collective healing begins") borders diagnostic but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from individual photos to spiral dove on corkboard, culminating in Charged Poise RR as grandchildren witness transmuted ghosts smiling. Orientation anchored early (lavender field, factory ruins, Saturdays). Closure cost legible in "pain not erased but folded into beauty sharp enough to cut fresh gratitude."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy vivid and selective (iron/honey air, purple soles, diesel wind); lavender field/factory constrain ritual as witnesses, mirroring internal ache. Recurring tools (map case, tweezers, key) charge final dove image, evolving with photos. No white-room; spatial choreography clear through kneeling, pinning, standing back.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmute pain via photos) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through arcs aligning into dove, narrowing to sharing under lens. Agency in rotations/whispers forces trade-off: solitude to witnessed vulnerability. One deepening sufficient; cost felt in lingering grief stitched to present, charging final exhale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of pain-to-masterpiece emerges organically from photo rituals and final dove/share; subtext in arcs as "method for sailors to remember they are small and still belonging." Ending image reweights premise without moralizing, folding collective ache into gratitude. No tidy binaries; ambiguity in whimsy lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (arcs, spirals everywhere); voice modulates rhythmically from calm setup to charged close. Whisper to bee/factory natural, goal-driven. No head-hopping; diction biased toward transmutive whimsy, consistent under low stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud (short bee breath to long quilt sentence); density high, multi-job lines like "pinned the image... lifted another." Minor overwriting in opening figuratives ("vines climb... fingers tasting") borders density penalty but pattern-taught, pays off in spiral. No loops; propulsion clear to closure chuckle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of photo-archivist ritual transmuting factory ghosts into dove via arcs; tropes (haunted ruins, healing art) transformed by silver key/photo mechanics. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight. No derivative templates; bold whimsy integral.</comment>
