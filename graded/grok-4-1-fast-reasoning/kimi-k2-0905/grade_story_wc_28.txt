<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between preaching universal knowledge and releasing memories act simultaneously in visions and tesserae arrangement; final renunciation of self-righteousness earned via mother-with-book image, foreclosing radical past with felt isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective cycles build density to CR closure in completed mosaic ("constructing empathy's armor"), reconfiguring memory/mercy stance; cost legible in her departure and stolen stone, with early anchors waiving orientation test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tesserae as recurring micro-setting constrain choices (collecting 49, guided arrangement) and charge final infinite-arms image; shattered sky and plaza evolve tactilely through starlight work to citizens' additions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mercy in remembrance/forgetting signaled early via visions, tightens accumulatively through methodical collection to deepening realization ("empathy's armor"); agency in mosaic creation forecloses judgment-free holding with departure cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mercy via forgetting emerges organically from burning-book vision to infinite-arms mosaic, offering non-literal resonant answer in viewer-choice positioning that reweights prior self-righteousness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with tactile perceptual signature ("fingers reading history in shattered glass"); rhythmic compression suits accumulative mode, modulating from trapped cycles to charged poise at dawn.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax in peak arrangement beat; no loops or artifacts, purposeful metaphors like "arms of steel" integrate without muddle, though minor reflection density nudges from 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-fire memory maps and Iron Cradle legend transforms radical trope through tesserae-forgetting mechanic; risk in lyric CR heightens conceptual stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
