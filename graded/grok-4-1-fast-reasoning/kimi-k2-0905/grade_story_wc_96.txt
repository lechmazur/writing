<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lark's embodied molt ("new skin still trembles") and micro-choices (showing tin, bluffing Rourke) earn final change to "co-conspirator"; distinct voices in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds to Charged Poise closure in sealing tin and deceiving Rourke; cost legible in ashes of selves; orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted library constrains rebuild and hiding; "punctured ceiling" and stove charge final spiral nest image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (beauty from anarchy) tightens via collaborative spiral under siren pressure, bluff to Rourke forecloses exposure with agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Paper cranes reweight anarchy motif in final image, emergent without statement; resonance from burning selves.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("words arrive jagged"); dialogue subtextual ("taste the bones"); stable close-third POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density ("flames bloom green, luminous fracture"); varied rhythm, no loops or muddled metaphors in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Molting poet and crane-wings synthesize fresh resistance frame; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes.</comment>
