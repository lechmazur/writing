<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Posy's motivation as generational translator is vividly embodied in micro-choices like trapping the dune's sigh, with internal faith conflicting against lacking the great-grandmother's voice; the closure act of emptying jars earns her weightless exhale. No major flaws touch the earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of captured sounds building to RR closure in the music box's projection ("We are still becoming"), with conceptual cost legible in reweighting her quest; orientation anchors immediately in loft/Posy/dawn; single scene fits defaults perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Feral loft's salt-bleached arches and dune collapse constrain her solitary practice and charge final holographic projection on curved ceiling; sensory details (apricot salt, gull-cries) filter through her poetic bias, evolving with jars' glow to mirror redemption.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reviving box via sound-gleaning signaled early, tightens accumulatively through child's unexpected voice deepening the generational pressure; one meaningful cadence shift in box's click forces stance reconfiguration with felt faith-cost, legible on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-bridge emerges organically from jarred voices and box's "We are still becoming," reweighting prior particulars without moralizing; subtext in pennies as "invitations" invites ambiguity on redemption's permanence, resonant via final shared hum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in poetic syntax ("kelp-stitched blankets," "apricot salt") modulates with intensity, stable close-third POV; no dialogue to judge, but internal voice coherent and biased toward sonic/textural noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety propels via varied openings and lengths, but dense figurative layering ("wind slithered... flute," "ribs like a cat") in every sentence risks overwriting in jar-emptying beat, slightly dulling propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of sound-jars and holographic forgiveness transforms vagrant-poet trope into fresh memory-economy; risk-taking in lyric accumulative drive heightens conceptual stakes, with box's message feeling inevitable from jars' buildup.</comment>
