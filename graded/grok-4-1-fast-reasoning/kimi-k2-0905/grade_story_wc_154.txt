<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (guilt from mistranslation vs. urge to translate) act in decryption beat; final shared birthday/scar choice earned with embodied cost in sternum ache opening outward.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via personal notes discovery to CR closure; cost legible in "lotus-hearted ache remained... petals held dew instead of blood" reconfiguring anxiety from shrapnel to sediment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurring coral fragment constrains choices (tapped by boy, aligned on cast) and charges final lighter pocket image; mist/droplets mirror internal gyres purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (graft meaning onto guilt-wounds) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via birthday/spiral recognition forcing confession; cost in staying as morphine pulls boy under, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final "coral back into my pocket, lighter now" offers resonant non-literal answer to translation-as-healing, reweighting shared anxieties without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in linguistic lens ("syllables pool like rainwater in coral cups"); rhythm modulates with pressure, elision of backstory taught early and paid in present decryption.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; figurative pattern (spirals, tides) coherent without muddle, though dense metaphors slightly thicken peak decryption beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of war translator decrypting child-cast confession with coral-reef memory; risk-taking lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes.</comment>
