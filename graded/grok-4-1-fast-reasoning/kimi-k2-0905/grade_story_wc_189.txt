<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under relational pressure, like shifting the lantern to invite observation; daughter's inherited "watching sideways" earns change with cost in prior fracture. Contradictory impulses in tangential avoidance vs. direct offering of cicada act simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solo observation to shared brittle-star moment, landing Charged Poise closure in cicada handoff and "pause is a cocoon" with felt relational/emotional cost legible in "warmth passing from hand to hand."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (drips as "syllables," phosphorescent "limestone ribs") filters through POV bias; grotto and cicada constrain choices (ledge placement, palm-up offer) and charge final "shared heartbeat" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciliation via tidal patience) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through daughter's arrival and merged shadows narrowing to handoff; agency in lantern shift and cicada offer forecloses fracture path with visible pain-navigation cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of tidal time/texture emerges organically from particulars (anemone hearts, silt layering); final "difficult conversation... tidal, advancing, retreating" reweights premise non-literally with resonant ambiguity, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in tangential noticing ("moonlight fractured on wet stone"); minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Listen to the pool hold the ocean"), rhythmic control modulates to charged poise without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (tidal metaphors taught early); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops/artifacts; minor simile density in peak ("grotesque" shadows) purposeful without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chronicler profession and cicada-as-transition transforms reconciliation trope via oblique nature observation; "every pause is a cocoon" feels inevitable, risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes.</comment>
