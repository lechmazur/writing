<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's acoustically perceptive trait and motivation to unbind the bowl root choices in embodied interiority, with contradictory impulses between family tradition and reimagining shown in whispering the story then improvising the resonator. Final renunciation of leaving the bowl earns closure via prior micro-choices under pressure. No stock phrasing; traits particularize perception throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from planting/whispering to tremor/root/resonator, culminating in Charged Poise RR as hush lifts and seedling unfurls with felt cost of tradition's reimagining. Orientation anchors by para 2; single scene coherent. Closure image ("seedling’s first leaf unfurled, green as a new question") makes before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse/shipwrecks constrain choices (wire from rigging, glass echoes teach letting go) and charge final image (greenhouse "kept breathing unfinished music"). Sensory hierarchy acoustic/embodied via POV; details evolve causally (droplets as applause). No white-room; lived-in tactile use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbind bowl via music/life) signaled early; Accumulative escalation via pattern break (hush widens to lifts) driven by agency (unfinished notes to resonator), narrowing to renunciation with visible cost in leaving humming bowl. One decisive deepening sufficient; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in unfinished emerges organically from particulars (unfinished harmonic, root through bowl, green leaf); final image reweights tradition without moralizing, offering resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in silence as invitation; no tidy binaries or platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (drips as "minor seventh," note "wobble on purpose"); rhythmic control modulates with intensity, syntax reflects acoustic bias. Purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short punchy silences, flowing harmonics); metaphors coherent/integration purposeful ("sky still wore the color of old pennies"). Zero loops/artifacts; propulsion peaks clean in resonator beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-burnt acoustic ecology transforms tropes (ruins as listeners); risk in lyric unfinished structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via seed-to-leaf arc. No templates; voice/setting cohere uniquely.</comment>
