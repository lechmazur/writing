<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene (fear vs. trust in "planks yielded like memory"); final release earned by prior collections with cost to doll/memory. Interiority concrete via embodied tasting; micro-choices reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences builds to CR closure in "released the flavors... painting the inverted sky"; cost legible in "stretched sky in every breath" and empty doll.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Trellis and doll constrain choices (stepping, trading, wedging); root-chandelier garden charges final release image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (escape contraction via silences) tightens accumulatively through membrane break and time thinning, forcing release agency with cost to stored flavors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of "audible colors" and "stretched sky" reweights contraction theme non-literally from particulars, embracing ambiguity of ordinary hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in silence-tasting; rhythmic control modulates from hushed ascent to spiraling release, POV stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; minor simile density ("thick as honey yet weightless") in opening risks overwriting but pattern-taught as hush motif pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inverted gravity and silence flavors feels inevitable; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
