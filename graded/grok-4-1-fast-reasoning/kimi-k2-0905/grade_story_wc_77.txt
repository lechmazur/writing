<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied (words "clog like sawdust," clutching clasp for heat); contradictory impulses act in pinning photo over speaking; final forgiveness earned via prior micro-choices under advisor's urging, with cost of advisor's silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds to pinning photo as decisive micro-turn opening corridor (beat linkage); CR closure lands on-page with clasp snapping and mirrors dissolving to salt, cost legible in "unfrightened heart" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Funhouse micro-setting (warped corridors, twitching strips) constrains path and charges final mirror panel; recurring clasp as tool enables pinning choice; sensory hierarchy (candied apples/wet copper narrowing to luminance) reflects urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trick fear) signaled early, textural escalation via density to child confrontation forces renunciation; agency in pinning and offering note forecloses dread-path with on-page cost (clasp relinquished, mirrors collapse).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of forgiving reflection emerges organically via mirrors/motifs shifting from distortion to recognition; final image ("light I finally recognized as mine") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("roadkill...jeweled beneath headlights") biases toward repulsive allure; rhythmic compression modulates with intensity, stable first-person focalization; purposeful elision (dream dictionary mechanics) taught and legible to CR payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pinned...watched the paper bleed light" advances plot/atmosphere); figurative coherence in luminance/mirror pattern pays off without muddle; no loops, propulsion syncs to surreal beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of carnival psychodrama via "photographically cursed" booth and clasp reversal; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
