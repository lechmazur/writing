<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in fragment's tingle warming ribs and sighs costing brushstrokes, earning realization; minor abstraction in epiphanic traits like "heart over-exposed" limits 9+ contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in mural's glow and fragment dissolution, cost legible in "each brushstroke cost her a sigh"; orientation anchored early in fog-drowned orchard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains via fog scattering beams and living wall enabling display, charging final private dawn image; selective sensory fog, plaster, cider smells integrate purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rediscovering joy tightens accumulatively through fragment pulse to wall painting, agency in whispering passphrase and pressing palms forecloses path with embodied sigh-cost; minor abstract stakes early.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of joy as undeveloped film emerges organically via returning light/fog images shifting to "refilling the ruined orchard," resonant non-literal ending reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("paints with light") stable in single POV, rhythmic modulation peaks in "noon and twilight rubbed shoulders"; purposeful compression taught early, legible closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but figurative overload in painting climax ("arc of the hose, her grandfather’s conspiratorial wink") risks coherence without obscuring closure; no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of muralist magic, Lantern Lattice ghosts, and film-memory in fog transforms loss trope; risky daydream folds heighten stakes organically to charged vermilion cheek.</comment>
