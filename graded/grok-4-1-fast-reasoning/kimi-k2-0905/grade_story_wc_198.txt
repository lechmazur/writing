<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory endurance (hush now vs. endless tomorrow) acts in micro-choices like fingering shifts, earning final erasure with throat-raw cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of notes/overtones peaks in backward-erasing note as charged poise RR, reconfiguring prophecy with perpetual-duty cost legible in final line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism atrium constrains choices via chimes forcing "altered fingering"; dew evolves causally, charging closure reflections.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (hush prophecy) tightens via echoes/prophecy pushback, protagonist agency in diminished chord/trill forecloses death clause with raw-throat and duty cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distorted dew-face reflections offer resonant non-literal answer to fate's spaces-between, reweighting negative-space motif without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Musician-biased perception ("reed flutter like trapped moth," "notes folded into overtones") signatures voice; stable close-third distance modulates rhythm under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motif repeats ("dewdrops form," "in mist") borderline template cadence across beats slightly dull propulsion; figurative density coherent and voice-driven elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Saxophone prophecy-bargain via negative-space music synthesizes fresh musician-fate angle; risk of lyric hush heightens stakes organically.</comment>
