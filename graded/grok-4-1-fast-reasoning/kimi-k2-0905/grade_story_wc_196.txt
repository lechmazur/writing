<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rowan's contradictory impulses (stipend lie vs. admitted hope) act in scene through dust-brushing and button-placement micro-choices, earning the final renunciation of abyss for hallway with visible emotional cost. Interiority particularized via uncle memory cued by button. No safety-hedging; flaws (broken heart) complicate and propel closure act.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust density increases to button-file linkage, culminating in Charged Poise CR where sealing the box reconfigures unknowns as navigable hallway ("the unknown was no longer an abyss but a hallway"). Orientation anchored early (file room, archivist). Cost legible in "click travel through her ribs," foreclosing isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>File room and dust constrain choices (sweeping reveals patterns guiding file-open), charging final snowflake image mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (dust as "sailors read wind"). Evolving details (halos to script) mirror emotional arc without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (magnify kindness) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via button-uncle-Marcus deepening that forces button placement, foreclosing inaction with vulnerability cost ("pursue if inquiry ever made"). Agency in envelope-note act narrows cynicism option. Coherent pressure to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (archives as futures via kindness) emerges organically from dust-file acts; final snowflake ("each flake a small kindness accumulating") non-literally reweights premise, inviting ambiguity without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable; irony in her own foster past charges resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (dust as "ridges the way sailors read wind") modulates rhythmically under rising density, stable third-person limited POV. Custodian nod carries no leakage. Compression taught early via patterns, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propulsion (e.g., "light unfurl across its dents like sunrise") varies rhythm without loops or muddle; metaphors coherent, voice-motivated. No scaffolds; read-aloud ear confirms natural cadence supporting accumulative build to "cold unfurl against her skin."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dust-pattern "divination" and button-to-foster-link synthesize fresh angle on lost histories, transforming trope via tactile archive poetics. Risky lyricism heightens stakes coherently; button's "marching orders" inevitable in hindsight, no hedging.</comment>
