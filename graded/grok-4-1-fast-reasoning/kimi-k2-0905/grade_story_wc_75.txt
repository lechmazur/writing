<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aurelia's arc from cataloguer to participant peaks in shaping "H" for home, earned by contradictory impulses of preservation vs. immersion shown in her cracked composure and micro-choices like photographing loaves for portable archives.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of images (honey jars to woven bees) builds to CR closure where opera glass fades to clear, reweighting observer role with felt cost of abandoning her lens; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto's waterfall roar and limestone alcoves constrain isolation while charging final image of flowers in cracks; sensory details like candlelit dough filter through Aurelia's priorities, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing arts tightens accumulatively via Chen family's kitchen takeover, forcing her stance crystallization; cost legible in foreclosing detached observation for hands-on survival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of culture as shared lifeboat emerges implicitly through bread and bees motifs, with final "H" loaf and fading lens offering non-literal resonant answer to mutual rescue without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in opera glass scans; sparse dialogue like grandmother's line carries subtext and advances pressure naturally, rhythm modulating to charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action and image propulsion; purposeful repetition of bread/bees builds texture, but minor figurative density in reflective beats (e.g., "frozen waterfalls of memory") slightly dulls peak momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto baking amid displacement synthesizes climate migration and cultural persistence into fresh, inevitable CR; risk in lyric accumulation heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
