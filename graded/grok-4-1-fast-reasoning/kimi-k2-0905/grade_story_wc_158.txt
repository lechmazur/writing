<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via shell memories and postcard handling; contradictory exhaustion and tugging longing act simultaneously until peeling the postcard earns sleep as alliance, not surrender.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density of dew-reflected centuries tightening to conceptual repricing closure: peeling postcard releases petals that photosynthesize longing, with cost of leaving centuries behind legible in sealed film at apex.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Nautilus cathedral's spiral stairs and dew-planetarium constrain ascent and charge final glow; limestone drinks voice and iridescent details mirror internal states through tactile perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Insomnia stake signaled early deepens via rising wind and postscript reading, forcing peeling choice that forecloses circling war with felt cost of bloom's perpetual watch over his rest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of pain-to-beauty emerges implicitly via petals seeding battlefields; final descending image reconfigures armistice as poet-mailed treaties without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tasting syllables and coral bruises; rhythmic modulation builds from shy breeze to swelling tide, POV stable without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering taught early; no loops or scaffolds, rhythm varies read-aloud from clipped ascent to expansive chorus multiplication.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shellgram poet, petal-postcards, and bioluminescent armistice transforms insomnia trope; risk of sustained lyric density pays off in inevitable hindsight closure.</comment>
