<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and dye-particular, with contradictory impulses in claiming vs. channeling stories; final purpose shift earned by heart-pulse visions without tidy rationalization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from wing alignment to painting dissolution; CR closure legible in palm-press memory with porosity cost felt in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tea house window and wing scales constrain alignment choice, charging ghost-images; mist-vapor shapes mirror internal porosity without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (story magnetism) deepens decisively via projected visions narrowing to channel realization; agency in brush-stroke forecloses collector path with transformation cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of narrative porosity emerges implicitly from wing-to-pigment evolution; final folded-map image reweights vessel/catalyst binary with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with dye-master perceptual signature in pigment/light patterns; rhythmic modulation heightens visionary pressure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel insight accumulation; minor motif repetition ("valley-mist wonder") borders loop but serves taught lyric pattern without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh donor-heart story-magnetism synthesis transforms transplant trope through dye-logic; risk in dissolving wing heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
