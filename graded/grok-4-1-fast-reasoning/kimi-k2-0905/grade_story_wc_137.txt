<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when memories surge and Mara staggers but rights the telescope, choosing to listen; final renunciation of proof for tenderness is earned with embodied cost in her "crowded with tenderness."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (memories, whale song, jasmine) builds to Charged Poise closure; tile's midnight lift and transcription tightening reweights skepticism with legible cost of unpublishable trust in the tide pool moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower, astrolabe, and ocean constrain choices—starlight triggers memories, walls turn porous; recurring whale exhalations and final misted glasses charge closure image, filtering through Mara's evolving perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Skepticism vs. participation stake signaled early tightens when Mara aligns forgotten patterns despite surge, forcing endurance; cost felt in abandoning "proof" for "hollow space," charging whales' answering bass.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of participatory connection emerges organically via tile's "participation: feel, connect"; final notebook raise and whale response reweights premise without moral, resonant via calf breach image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual bias shifting from "refused to believe" seams to porous borders; rhythmic texture modulates from doubt to syncopated stride, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density in lines like "ink flowed into shapes that were not digits but staves" propels without loops; figurative coherence (tuning fork tower, salt galaxies) peaks at closure unmarred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic tile as time-ocean keel with whale symphony transforms skeptic trope; risk of lyric memory-entanglement pays off in irreplaceable tide pool forfeiture.</comment>
