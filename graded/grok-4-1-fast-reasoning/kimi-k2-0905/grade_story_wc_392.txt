<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in journal-triggered memories act simultaneously with present grip on lantern; final rebellion earned by prior causal buildup of personal/father parallel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via discovery density ("tally marks" to journal) tightening to charged poise closure; "each step a small rebellion" images legible cost in guilt foreclosure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel darkness and concrete grooves constrain discoveries, charging final "darkness less absolute" image; body/lantern as micro-setting anchors tactile progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake deepens accumulatively through journal revelation narrowing to personal entanglement; agency in closing journal and walking back crystallizes stance with guilt's "gravity" cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Entangled memories emerge as theme via particulars, final lantern reprise non-literally answering control with guidance; reweights premise without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature ("tunnel like a throat," memories "hit like a train"); rhythmic modulation under stress via shortening sentences sustains pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density in "Carved into the surface, barely visible, were tally marks—hundreds of them, grouped in sets of seven"; propulsion matches scene without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"The water remembers" twists engineer guilt into fresh drought-power synthesis; lantern's historical reprise risks bold resonance without gimmick.</comment>
