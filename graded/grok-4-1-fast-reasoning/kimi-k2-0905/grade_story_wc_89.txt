<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in fighting skin's glow to stay flesh for ritual ("ribs brightening like lanterns, but I fought the change"), earning the merger choice with relational cost; shadow's warning adds crucible pressure. Interiority particular via tastes/memories; no labels dilute embodiment. Final renunciation of separate forms seals arc holistically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual densities scents/memories to RR closure as merged entity rises with cost ("one of us had to die into the other’s form"); orientation anchors in first paragraph (barefoot arrival, orchard, post-phoenix). Steps link causally without gaps; fortune guides payoff seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard constrains ritual (oldest apple tree's roots for bowl placement) and charges final image (blossoms burn gently); sensory bias via protagonist's scents/memories filters vividly (ghost pepper oils sting palms). Micro-setting (porcelain bowl, feathers) integrates tactilely; moonlight permanence mirrors theme without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforge bond) tightens accumulatively via spice beats to merger escalation, agency in inhaling shadow foreclosing separation with legible cost; phoenix scream forces crystallization. No reversals needed; density reweights options perfectly under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Paradox of love/fire emerges organically via spices bridging death, resonant non-literal close ("love can be both furnace and forge") reweights fortune without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "two voices in one chest." Particulars (cardamom toast scent) ground thematic irony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature biases to scents/tastes (e.g., "branded...with the taste of her sorrow"); syntax/rhythm modulate intensity (short breaths in climax). Shadow dialogue natural/subtextual; no head-hopping, stable intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "poured...shaped it into the circle she used to draw"); metaphors cohere (fire/pomegranate/seeds) without muddle, rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor figurative density in ritual but pattern-taught; zero loops/scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic sister-phoenix ritual via spice-caravan memories transforms tropes; merger turn inevitable from particulars, risks cosmic scale boldly without gimmick. Final "sang the lullaby backwards" inflects uniquely.</comment>
