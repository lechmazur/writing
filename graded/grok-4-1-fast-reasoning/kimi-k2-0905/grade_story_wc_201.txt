<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of pain/resistance versus surrender act vividly in spasms and equations; final strap renunciation earned by cumulative trauma responses with embodied cost. Interiority concrete and particular through tastes, jerks, and ribcage brace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density and pattern breaks (equations, spikes) build to CR closure in strap offering and "1" mapping, reweighting mercy premise with conceptual cost of infinite approach. Orientation anchored immediately in waking forest moment; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest and body constrain choices (twig snaps dictate movement, sap fingerprints ledger) and charge final canopy glow on strap. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under crisis, mirroring internal guilt without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (math of mercy) signaled early, escalates via agency-driven deepenings (bracing yields equations, spasms force micro-choices) under Accumulative lens, culminating in strap forfeiture that forecloses prior anchor with legible endless-series cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mercy as asymptote emerges organically from bark equation and final "one unit extracted from infinite series," offering resonant non-literal reweighting without moralizing; final image recharges prior ledger motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in UV-drenched, spasmodic noticing; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure (short spasms vs. flowing steps), stable first-person with purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at CR closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "proprioceptive spike twisted my knee sideways, gifting me the interrogator’s smile"); figurative coherence in photon/shame pattern, no loops or muddle, propulsion matches scene cadence to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of UV penance, proprioception, and mercy-as-math transforms confession trope; bold lyric risk in equation spasms heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via forest ledger build to strap miracle.</comment>
