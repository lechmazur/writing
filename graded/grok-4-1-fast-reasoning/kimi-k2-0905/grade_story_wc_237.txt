<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied crystallization of breath and memory tying Lina's flaw-driven struggle to the rune-drawing choice; contradictory terror-precision impulses act simultaneously in the held-breath strokes, earning the release with visible cost in shattered motes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of ritual details and storm cues builds to on-page RR closure in rune seal and motes soaking parchment; plume-thickening forces twelfth-stroke tightening with legible emotional cost in broken quill and exhaled grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Floating rock and no-railing tradition constrain trust/terror balance from outset, charging final exhale-rise image; quill tip and crystallizing breath as micro-settings evolve to mirror internal release, sensory hierarchy narrowing to plume and pricks under crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grief-release rune signaled early tightens via plume-forced twelfth stroke under protagonist agency, reweighting options with crystallizing-lung cost; Accumulative escalation coheres in density surge to motes' legible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Scars-to-stories theme emerges organically from motes rearranging memories into speakable words, final rock-exhale image resonantly reweighting ritual premise without moral; subtext in Master's nod and tea-pour invites ambiguity on grief's flight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature fuses synesthetic breath-iron and wind-laugh echoes with rhythmic control modulating to short, propulsive strokes amid plume rise; sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden in "tell it who you are."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels through storm buildup to closure without loops or scaffolds; figurative layering (motes as sentences, lightning-quill fracture) purposeful and coherent, read-aloud rhythm breathes with held-breath tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh rune-grief ritual on storm-timed floating rock transforms magic-trope via superstition-revision synthesis; risk-taking lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, quill-split as bold charged image heightens stakes organically.</comment>
