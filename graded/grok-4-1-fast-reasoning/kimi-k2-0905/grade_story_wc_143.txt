<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inspector's interiority shines in embodied contradictions like voice cracking on field notes and heart syncing with anemones' pulse, driving micro-choices under time pressure. Final endurance to fire shutter earns closure with felt cost of witnessing extinction. Minor diagnostic edge in "curiosity was just another form of mourning" but anchored in grandmother's camera touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from prep to bloom to folding, culminating in Charged Poise closure as shutter clicks confirm "last possible second" with extinction cost. Orientation anchors immediately in summit and Earthrise. Single scene causality tight, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sensory details like "vitrified regolith... shattered glass" and terminator wind constrain timing, charging final fossil imprint. Earthrise frames shot, mirroring stakes. POV-filtered lunar specifics (feldspar vein, electrostatic whispers) evolve with action, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture last bloom) signaled early, escalates via wind-triggered folding narrowing options to final shutter bursts. Agency in outlasting hesitation forecloses undocumentation path with legible cost in crimson timer and contract expiry. Lens-deepening reweights via anemone heartbeat sync.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity-as-mourning emerges organically from sand grain's weight and ghost engineers, resonant in final Earth-witnessed fossil without moralizing. Closing image reconfigures documentation as resistance, lingering ambiguity on forgetting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in melancholic lyricism (e.g., "bioluminescent regret"). Rhythmic control modulates from anticipatory to peak compression in shutter clicks. No elision or head-hopping; voice biased toward fragile miracles.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer action/image (e.g., "petals curling inward with soft crystalline clicks"). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; figurative consistency in glass/shatter motifs serves lyric mode without muddle. Minor density peak in reflections but purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lunar extinction via chemical sand timers and septennial anemones transforms sci-fi tropes into poignant lyricism. Risky quiet closure heightens stakes through conceptual cost of undocumented miracles, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
