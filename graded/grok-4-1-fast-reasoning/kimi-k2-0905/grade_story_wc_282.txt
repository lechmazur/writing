<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aera's motivation intensifies credibly from mapping residual emotions to yielding her voice, with embodied contradiction in pressing the fossil despite its refusal of shores. Final renunciation of fear ("lighter by the mass of one fear") earned through collapse and raw throat. Contradictory impulses act in the radiant glimpse of alien memories, compelling the sonic outpouring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: emotional density builds via ochre/violet gradients to cold node interruption, culminating in Charged Poise closure as staff floats with undeniable cost (dissolved into rumor). Orientation anchored early in cave and post-hibernation timeframe. No lens ambiguity; fossil's rotation pays off inversion at "the cave’s emotion-heat inverted."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Coastal cave's salt-curtains, tide line, and bioluminescent hush constrain choices (fossil hovers "two hand-spans above the tide line") and charge final image (warm mineral floor). Sensory hierarchy reflects Aera's map-making bias, narrowing to thermal glyphs under crisis. Fossil-as-micro-setting evolves, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (voice of unknown) signaled early, tightens via fossil's interruption forcing trade-off: yield voice or silence bridge. Agency in "opened her mouth" drives escalation under Accumulative lens, with collapse as legible cost foreclosing unvoiced atlas. Persistent environmental pressure (tide/oceans) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of bridging silences emerges organically via transitional fossil, reweighted in staff's floating lighthouse without moralizing. Final image ("a lighthouse without fire") offers non-literal answer to unknown's voice, charging prior gradients with conceptual cost of rumor-dissolution. No tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers in "chosen to stay."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable, perceptual signature in heat-color topographies and "ache older than grammar." Rhythm modulates with intensity (short raw bursts at "sound poured out"). Purposeful compression taught early via glyphs, legible at sonic closure; diction biased to sensory mysticism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (e.g., "veins etched in stone yet flexible as fresh parchment"); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in climax coherent and pattern-taught, enhancing "leaf blazed like a newborn star" without muddling peak collapse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-hibernation mysticism and fossil as era-bridging seed; risk in factually-mystical science transforms trope of last survivor into resonant witness. Fossil's float reconfigures memory into audible coastline, inevitable from early gradients. Bold voice commits to lyric post-human premise without retreat.</comment>
