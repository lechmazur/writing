<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's wistfully pragmatic traits shine in the theft and teaching, with contradictory impulses (fines vs. garden) acting in the lock-picking beat; boy's minimalism applies pressure effectively. Final teaching moment earns change with embodied cost in petal dissolution. Voice specificity avoids stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light/garden motifs builds to Charged Poise closure in rooftop scene, where petal dust and tooth drop make cost legible ("final petal dissolve between them"). Orientation anchored early in harbor climb; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight and roof garden constrain via fire escape/lock, charging final rower image; sensory hierarchy (slosh, mildew, diesel) reflects Mara's priorities. Stairwell mildew pressures stealth without static backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (light to boy) signaled early, textural deepening in basement petal-sharing narrows options via fragile memory over permanence; agency in theft/teaching forecloses exposure risk with felt cost in tooth drop.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of fragile promises emerges via petal/light/oar particulars, resonant in boy's descent carrying "small reflected moon" without statement. Final image reweights hush into forward-pull without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with garden-perceptual bias ("oars in water" rhythm) stable in single POV; whisper dialogue natural/subtextual ("Hold it toward the bulb"). Compression taught early, pays off in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short peak sentences in lock-pick); high density in metaphors consistent/voice-driven without muddle. Minor density slip in repeated "hush" but pattern-taught, no loops dull closure petal image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of illicit garden rebellion into light-reflection metaphor transforms trope; tooth-to-nasturtium drop risks bold closure reconfiguration hinging on prior garden stake.</comment>
