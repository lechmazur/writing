<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Patiently strategic motivation drives micro-choices like the chain-arrow distraction and non-violent waltz, embodied in calm breathing under pressure; interiority concrete via chord humming. Minimal internal contradiction shown simultaneously weakens simultaneity test slightly, but final endurance of chain as "parade ribbon" feels earned with cost. No stock phrasing or epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: decoding → south → vault under Tilt-A-Whirl → timed distraction as wall falls → access and planting. Closure as Charged Poise in seed-scattering and skyward arrow, with legible cost in converging sirens and regime reclaim. Orientation anchored immediately in mirror wall and carnival center.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (cellophane flash, chain scrape like tuning fork, dry earth breath) constrain choices: netting pins guards, booth hides vault. Carnival micro-setting charges final image of arrow flight in mirrors, mirroring liberation. POV bias filters through strategic patience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect vault sans gunfire) signaled early, tightens via guards' arrival forcing non-violent impede; agency in dance pins them as shell falls. Escalation causal under lens narrows options, cost visible in sirens forcing quick plant-and-flee. Moral calculus: resilience over violence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of planting post-liberation emerges via seed motif shifting from hidden cache to scattered promise, resonant in final footprints spelling chord. No moralizing; ambiguity in regime's dusk reclaim lingers. Protagonist arc inextricable from resilience question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with carnival-inflected perceptual signature (chains singing, explosion as bass drum) modulates rhythm under stress; stable close third-person limited. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("Win a prize"), goal-driven halt. No head-hopping; diction fits gritty liberator.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "C, E♭, G, B♭—a minor seventh that spelled 'south'"); rhythmic variety, no loops or scaffolds. Patterned metaphors cohere without muddle in peak (guard waltz); minor figurative density in opener doesn't obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: carnival ghosts/scraps liberate seeds via ciphered chord and cellophane arrow, transforming dystopian tropes through grounded tactics. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure image; no derivatives, inevitable hindsight via patient motif.</comment>
