<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses culminate in the expulsion choice, earned by peripheral talent's costs; the rootlet piercing diaphragm moment reveals flaw-driven struggle without safety-hedging. Micro-choices like embossing leaves externalize the swallowed weight compellingly. Voice-specific blind spots (half-glimpsed failures) drive inevitable sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from sketches to deliberate smudging and stone expulsion as RR/CR; orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure cost legible in "4.7 grams of sorrow" entry and temporary innocence image. No orientation debt; single scene fits defaults seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (anemometer, logbook, rain gauge) constrains choices and charges closure; laurel illustration evolves from touchstone to burial wrap. Sensory hierarchy (pine resin taste, rime creak) reflects oracle's urgent priorities. Weather (snow, aurora) causally mirrors and pressures internal growth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expel truth's weight) signaled early, escalates via agency in外出 and smudging under accumulative lens, narrowing to diaphragm pierce and cough. Cost unmistakable in weighed memories and foreclosed protection. One decisive deepening suffices, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth's burdensome prophecy emerges organically from particulars, reweighted in stone's graphite thunder taste and blank illustration silhouette. Final image answers central question (swallowed fact's cost) non-literally via evacuated innocence. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in peripheral failures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("swaying certainties," margins) biases noticing consistently; rhythmic control modulates from quiet transcription to peak expulsion. Lyrical compression taught early pays off in charged closure without head-hopping. POV stability perfect for lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; metaphors cohere (veins to topographic map) without muddle in climax. Varied rhythm propels from cot to snowfield; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull expulsion beat. Ear-test flawless, specificity replaces generics throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms oracle trope via weather instruments as prophetic margins and seed-to-stone arc; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically. Fresh synthesis of botanical/sci-fi elements feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
