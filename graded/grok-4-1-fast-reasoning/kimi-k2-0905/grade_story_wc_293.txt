<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in hesitation before crushing flake and taking hand, earned by father's fall memory; interiority concrete via embodied violin tension and wind pitch. Final renunciation of "never" shows hierarchy of values with visible cost. Flawless single-POV execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of motifs builds to CR where doorway thins into lens of possibles, cost legible in flake crushed "grinding pixels into luminous dust." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via playing reveals path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Guardrail shadow as doorway constrains step into possibility, charging final image; flake as micro-setting evolves tactilely. Sensory hierarchy musical/visual via POV bias; no generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to sculpt possibility tightens accumulatively through flake warming and pixels shifting, forcing agency in crushing and stepping; cost unmistakable in "hesitated, remembering her father’s fall." Escalation driven by her playing under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of violin alone with glinting square reweights "never" as movable pixel, resonant non-literal answer to amnesty theme; emerges organically from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in refracted futures and tarp arpeggios; rhythmic control modulates from unfurling notes to charged hum. Stable single-POV, purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, rhythm varies read-aloud; figurative coherence in pixel/tarp/music vehicles, though climax density slightly thickens "squares shifting like stop-motion." Zero loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wet-plate pixels, violin recounting, and tarp code transforms "never" into bridge of hope; risk-taking in lyric mosaic heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
