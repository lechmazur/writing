<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong particularity in Marisol's chef-like tasting of memories as recipes reveals interior conflict and embodied emotion; pivotal reversal of her gift feels earned through prior submersion. Minor abstractness in epiphany ("sorrow that could shelter life") borders unearned but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from courtyard patterns to coral submersion; closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly in palm-pressing and light shift, with felt cost of self-submersion legible in "her knees buckled." Orientation anchored early; no shards or transitions violate scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Coral walls and tidal pools constrain descent and charge final image of rearranging sand; sensory hierarchy (taste dominant) reflects POV bias perfectly. "Sand turned to glass... fractured into tidal pool formations" exemplifies selective, purposeful vividness mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sandpapering memories) signaled early tightens texturally via oceanic grief deepening, forcing reversal; agency in pouring memories forecloses erasure path with submersion cost on-page. Climax submersion narrows options under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of transforming (not erasing) grief emerges organically from coral interaction and final sand shift; resonant non-literal answer in "secret ingredient" reweights premise. Slight echo in closing line ("grief could enhance rather than overwhelm") deducts but doesn't replace image pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with distinct perceptual signature (tasting memories, recipe analogies); rhythmic control heightens submersion pressure in "drowning in million-year cycles." No head-hopping or elision issues; voice modulates purposefully from curse to release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but figurative density in peak ("throat... polyp a tiny mouth") risks minor overwrite without full pattern payoff, dulling submersion slightly. No loops or scaffolds; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic memory-tasting chef in fossilized oceanic grief transforms trope organically; risk-taking in lyric reversal heightens stakes via coral exchange, inevitable in hindsight from early patterns.</comment>
