<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Archetypal wise elder (Marta) and eager youth (Jun) limit interior contradiction and specificity; embodied actions like Marta's crooning show traits under pressure, but epiphanies feel told. Final stamping earned by prior coaxing but lacks deeper flaw-complicated choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building motifs (paw prints, howl) to Charged Poise closure at stamping where paths untangle with conceptual cost of hound's internal shift; orientation anchored immediately; one tightening via fractured paths suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ridgeway's shifting contours and cliff constrain navigation, charging final refocus; sensory selectivity (howl, lantern light) mirrors internal states purposefully without catalog; recurring lanterns/ticket punches as micro-setting evolve with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore hound) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through indirect routes to cliff confrontation; Jun's stamping agency forecloses lost-guardian path with hound's whimper as felt cost, legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of internal courage emerges via hound's arc, resonant in final self-chosen duty; undermined by direct articulations like "courage unused simply waits for recognition," bordering thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person collective POV with perceptual bias toward guides' wisdom; poetic diction/rhythm modulates lullaby tone consistently; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual (Marta's "Easy, girl").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies poetically, but minor paraphrase loops on "courage unused" and ticket punch chimes dull density in mid-section; high information integration in action, no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh mythic synthesis of self-discovery via hound/ferry allegory transforms tropes through star-stamping climax; purposeful risk in shifting reality heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
