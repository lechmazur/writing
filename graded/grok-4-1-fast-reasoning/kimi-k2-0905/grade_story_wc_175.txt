<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in "hammering heart" syncing with butterfly rhythm, revealing contradictory loss/completion; motivation to honor histories compels knotting under time pressure, earning final tears without epiphanic overreach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of arriving butterflies tightening stake; on-page CR closure in memorial's lift-off with "silver wire catching sunlight," legible cost in fading knee imprints and empty pocket.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Grotto's "cloud-soil that would dissolve by nightfall" constrains timing of build and charges final lift; sensory selectivity (moss/mineral air, fern roots) mirrors Elara's priorities, vivid without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of timely memorial signaled early, deepens accumulatively with twin butterfly landing then flock arrival forcing fluid adaptation; cost unmistakable in transient dissolution foreclosing permanence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of temporary permanence emerges organically via wire cathedral and migrating stories; final "stories that now migrated across skies" offers resonant CR reweighting oversight without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature in story-reflections ("midwife who delivered three generations"); rhythmic modulation peaks in "spiral[ing] upward in a helix," no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "weightless yet somehow anchoring"; minor figurative density ("constellation of wire and fern fronds," "living shroud") in build risks overwriting but pattern-taught early sustains propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis of wire memorials, monarch migration, and dissolving histories feels inevitable; risk-taking in "grotto above the clouds" heightens ephemerality stakes without gimmick.</comment>
