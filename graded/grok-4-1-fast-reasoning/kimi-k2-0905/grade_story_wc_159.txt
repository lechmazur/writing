<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via foxglove heart embodying regret and duty; contradictory impulses peak in sacrificing Por's kiss, earning final self-offering with visible cost. Minor abstraction in emotions fits lyric voice without unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sacrifices tightens to CR closure where Lira offers silhouette, reweighting preservation with undeniable conceptual cost legible in "bulbs drank her, brightened to sunrise." Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Opal library and glass-orchids constrain choices (petals catch wisps, drawers supply tools) and charge final tube fall; sensory hierarchy (echoes, audible light) mirrors resonance stakes. Body as micro-setting (foxglove heart) evolves with sacrifices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve names vs. bulb dimming) escalates accumulatively through memory trades narrowing her to "translucent silhouette"; agency in selections drives deepening, cost unmistakable in self-erasure charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of preservation's self-erasing cost emerges organically from sacrifices to tube's reprise with child; final "foxglove regret... keeps the sky from forgetting" reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable, perceptual signature sound-biased (wisps like silk scarves); rhythmic control modulates pressure in sacrifice beats, pattern taught early for legible CR closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job images (e.g., "plume of audible light"); rhythm varies, no loops/artifacts dull peaks—sacrifices remain clear despite pervasive figures cohesive in voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinct feelings museum and resonant sacrifices transforms caretaker trope; tube's comet-fall inevitability risks bold lyric fantasy heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
