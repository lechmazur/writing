<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied contradictions like sweat-absorbed veil and throat-clustered atoms, driving the shift from purification to carrying scars; final removal of veil as earned renunciation with cost feels character-particular. Minor abstraction in epiphanies slightly detaches from micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of motifs building to CR closure: realization "to purify wasn't to erase but to carry gently" reweights premise with conceptual cost of shared burden, legible in veil-as-banner image. Orientation anchored immediately; no shards, seamless progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pagoda constrains choices (facets pulse, multiplies guilt) and charges final image as locket/compass; archive's copper tears, luminous dust filter through POV urgency. Sensory hierarchy sharpens crisis navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purify vs. nostalgia's pull) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to librarian temptation beat, narrowing to exit choice; cost in freckled skin and carried pagoda charges ending under lens. One tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of "beautiful contamination" emerges organically from particulars like screaming equations and veil folds; final tribe-building image offers non-literal answer to purification question, reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (moth refusing moon's geometry) consistent, rhythmic control modulates intensity; stable single POV with no elision, diction biased to historian's mythic lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm passes ear test; intentional motif repetition (atoms, pagoda) taught early avoids loops, but minor figurative density in mid-archive ("screaming equations that begged") borders overwriting without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archive quest into lyric memory-as-scar mythos; "walk backward while facing forward" turn inevitable from pattern-avoidance, risks poetic abstraction heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
