<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in kneeling at mother's betrayal ("throat full of salt") with simultaneous impulses to bury or reveal, earning the final choice with marrow-deep cost from prior trades.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>On-page Charged Poise closure in loudhailer reading with legible cost ("crown me or crucify me"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds as traded fragments texturally tighten to reconfigure futures, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Beach debris (shells, urchin spines, kelp) as micro-setting constrains parley choices and charges grammar-building grammar; lagoon's liquid night evolves causally, mirroring internal encryption.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decrypt via trade) deepens via betrayal reveal narrowing to reveal-or-bury, agency in offering "hour of my own death" foreclosing paths with on-page marrow rearrangement cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unburyable truth emerges organically via shells-to-voice arc; final sky-reading image non-literally answers encryption premise, reweighting shame with irreversible social cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (glyphs, marginalia) with archivist bias; rhythmic modulation peaks in "searing reverie drifting down like kerosene," no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figures ("missing teeth want their tongue") coherent across beats; varied rhythm propels without loops, clarity intact at closure image of "burnt ink" pages.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognitive lagoon trading futures for pasts via debris-grammar transforms memory trope; risk in conceptual integrity heightens stakes to bold voice-over-capital close.</comment>
