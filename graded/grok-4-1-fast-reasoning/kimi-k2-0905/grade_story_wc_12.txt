<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Priest's motivation to illuminate assumptions drives all micro-choices, from looping footsteps to final paradox, with embodied contradiction in belief/doubt chords; congregation reactions reveal his impact without deep relationships. Final endurance as anchor feels earned with visible bodily cost. Minor slip: interiority poetic but leans external, slightly archetypal under surreal pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of loops builds to overlap and demon hesitation, closure as Charged Poise when priest enters loop and entity shrinks into Möbius. Orientation anchored early in sanctuary/anchor. Cost legible in priest's slackening and demon's eternal spin.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sanctuary's spatial ribs and echo-fold constrain loops and anchor stress; palette as micro-setting charges final drain into transparent words. Sensory hierarchy favors sound/silence, reflecting priest's perceptual bias. Details tactile and evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert possession via doubt) signaled early, escalates texturally through overlapping loops and tremor, forcing priest's paradox and self-loop with agency. Tightening narrows demon's entry; cost in priest's transformation unmistakable at "body slackened."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of questioning faith emerges implicitly via looped contradictions and demon's trap, reweighting certainty as demon-food. Final image of living silence offers resonant CR without moralizing. Particulars like widow's lullaby deepen subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct surreal perceptual signature in sound-as-skin and null-air pockets; rhythmic modulation builds to closure cadence. Stable third-limited POV, no leakage; elisions (e.g., demon's taste) pay off in hesitation. Voice prose-like for priest's idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with loop repetitions purposeful, not artifact; high density integrates image/action without loops dulling propulsion. Minor overwrite in metaphors during peak ("Möbius strip of intent") coherent but thick; closure image clear/crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of loop pedal exorcism, colorless UV, rhetorical loops traps demon in doubt; risks surreal physics heighten stakes organically. No tropes untransformed; premise commits fully to auditory metaphysics.</comment>
