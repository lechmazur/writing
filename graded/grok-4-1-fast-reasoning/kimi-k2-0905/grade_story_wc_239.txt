<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority particular through cosmic mapping past and naked motivation, embodied in rib-wind and pulse surrender; final memory slide earns reconfiguration with erasure cost. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in kneeling beat, tilting toward archetype over flawed individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dictionary rearrangement to shelves' song and ink ants, yielding CR closure in "pure notation" with conceptual cost of self-puncture at spiral's center. Orientation anchored early in palm-press and arrival; pattern taught without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Temple library's basalt, marble spiral, and definition-mirror constrain walking circuits and charge final inward lane; sensory hush, starlight-dust, and flapping pages filter through witness's priorities, evolving with her circuits.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unravel illusions tightens texturally via spiral rules and memory gravity, forcing renunciation in forehead-press; cost legible in last memory's slide, narrowing to puncture without causal break.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unified spiral/endings emerges implicitly from dictionary braiding and witness multiplication, resonant in final "curve unifies" without moralizing; reweights premise via witnessed/witness collapse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Consistent third-limited POV with perceptual signature of spiraling notice (e.g., letters corkscrewing); rhythmic modulation peaks in silent pulse, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with metaphors (moths, accretion disks) pattern-taught via spirals, propelling to hush-swallow; minor figurative density in walking beats borders overwrite but coheres without muddle at closure kneel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic cartographer in hiccup-library, transforming endings trope via arbitration rules and self-shelving; risk in elliptical walk-inward charges stakes indelibly.</comment>
