<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the ritual—sharing pain while admitting her own suffocation—earning the final reconfiguration with her receiving the boy's breath-memory as cost-laden gift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build from boy's arrival to scar-linking ritual; closure lands as Charged Poise/CR in "his final gift... teaching her that suffocating to breathe... a beginning," with starlight cost reweighting her solitude.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Scorched circle and starlight-filtered roof constrain the ritual and charge the final image, mirroring her internal state without overt symbolism; selective sensory narrowing under ghost-pressure heightens specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake to teach crossing via shared suffocation tightens accumulatively through drowning in boy's moments and scar web, forcing her endurance-choice; cost legible in her rough voice and continued waiting, though slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of dying properly to breathe emerges organically from ritual particulars, reweighted non-literally in the starlight-breath image without moralizing; boy's question "suffocate so I can breathe?" crystallizes resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with biased perceptual signature (breath-pressure, glowing scars); rhythmic modulation peaks in ritual ("web of light that connected their shared suffering"), dialogue sparse/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric repetition ("suffocate," "starlight like frozen tears" bookends crisply); no loops, metaphors cohere (embers, thresholds) without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-tending via scar-ritual transforms bridge-burning trope into suffocation-as-liberation; risk in abstract conceit pays off inevitably at breath-gift reconfiguration.</comment>
