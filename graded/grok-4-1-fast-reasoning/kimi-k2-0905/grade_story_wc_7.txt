<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation shines in tasting glass to map failures, rooting rebellion in chef-specific sensory interiority; micro-choices like feeding blood reveal resolve with self-knowledge cost. Minor slip in abstract "synaptic plasticity" label without full embodied contradiction, but final laugh grounds it. Earned endurance against Ministry forecloses safe paths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from seed planting to vine transformation, landing CR closure in transformed greenhouse and seed dispersal with conceptual cost of defied authority. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (greenhouse, alignment). One tightening at sprouting pop narrows to harvest under time pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse constrains planting (rust flakes grind knees, broken glass tasted) and charges final image (copper bones polished, leaves as stained-glass). Sensory hierarchy chef-biased: tastes/scents dominate, mirroring internal states via volatile molecules. Evolution from decay to beauty mirrors stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (plant seed for memory-rewiring rebellion) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via sprouting and aroma drift narrowing to dawn exposure; Ministry arrival complicates but transformation crystallizes stance. Cost legible in risked capture, felt in Marisol's rooftop watch. Minor abstractness in "rewire collective tongue" slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of beauty as decay's offshoot emerges organically from pruning/harvest, final plate and seed pockets offering non-literal resonance reweighting ruins-to-mercy arc. Subtext in scents evoking unearned memories avoids moralizing. Complexity in rebellion's gentle spread vs. treason warnings lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with chef-perceptual signature (tasting rust, wind rattling bolts); lush syntax/rhythm modulates from reverent to triumphant, heightening pressure in alignment peak. No dialogue; voice diction (e.g., "edible scripture") controlled and particular. Patterned elision of mechanics taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "vines rose fast as clock hands spinning backward" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, openings diverse. Figurative density in peak sprouting beat risks overwrite (−0.4), but consistent taste-memory pattern coheres without muddle or loops. Minor scaffold in repeated "she" proximity, but propulsion intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia chef, synaptic cuisine rebellion, and ruin-gardening transforms tropes organically; "pruned carefully by hands that understood every scar" risks echo but grounds in tasting glass map. Bold premise fully committed, risk heightens stakes via memory-politics.</comment>
