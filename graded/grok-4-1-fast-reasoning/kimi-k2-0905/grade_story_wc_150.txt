<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in the pulsing sundial base and interrupted journeys, with contradictory impulses in kneeling amid fractured skulls despite exiles; micro-choices like aligning the gnomon on vertebrae earn the final renunciation of leaving, foreclosing exile paths with felt hollowing filled at cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as discoveries densify toward resonant reconfiguration; closure lands decisively when "the shadow stretched across the ruins, touching each beam until the wood remembered," reweighting time/faith with her permanence as conceptual cost; orientation anchored early in arrival, no drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard constrains choices via "sunlight speared through ceiling cracks" for mapping and roots knitting "femurs to fig trunks" guiding the root-road; recurring bones/roots charge final chapel image, with sensory selectivity (myrrh exhalation, fossilized petals) mirroring restoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring faith tightens accumulatively through reliquary discovery and roots moving, forcing her stance crystallization; agency in planting rib-gnomon pays visible cost of suspended ancestors resuming only via her blood-watered commitment, legible in dream of seed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of rebuilding faith/time emerges organically from bone-root entwinements and shadow's memory, reweighting interrupted journeys in final image of wanderers following shadow; no moralizing, resonance in "faith return... as breath, steady and shared," charging prior hollows.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical single POV stable with perceptual signature in "roots threading warmly curious fingers," modulating rhythm under pressure; boy's dialogue distinct ("rebuild or rob?") advances stakes naturally; purposeful elisions taught early pay off in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "gates hung open like a reluctant mouth" integrated into action, no loops or scaffolds; minor overwriting in dusk discoveries risks coherence but pattern-taught lyric mode sustains propulsion to closure's "blossoms opened in colors that had no names."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb orchard's bone-fruit roots and shadow-rebuilding sundial transforms diaspora tropes into inevitable restoration arc; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry, premise commits fully to enchanted realism.</comment>
