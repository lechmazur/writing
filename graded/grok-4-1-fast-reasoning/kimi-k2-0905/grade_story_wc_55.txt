<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradiction between ambition and listening, rooted in traits like introversion; micro-choices like cradling the clock reveal values under pressure. Earned renunciation peaks at "courage to bear the emptiness," foreclosing building with felt cost. Minor poetic abstraction slightly dilutes peak embodiment but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early and holds through density build to Charged Poise RR closure: "the weight had transferred... walking inside it." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; reflection ≤20% and anchored to present cues like petrichor. Cost legible in final surrender image; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (petrichor, frost hum) filtered via clockmaker's hush-attuned bias constrains choices like kneeling and placement. Forecourt/crystal charges closure "sun struck the wet brass, igniting... green fire" no one sees. Evolving details mirror stasis without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace via surrender) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to renunciation agency narrowing options; cost unmistakable in "emptiness he once feared" and transferred weight. Quiet escalation fits lens with one decisive intensification at prototype disposal. No abstract stakes or resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of gentle time vs. blade emerges organically from particulars like stuttering sparrow tick to silt-settling realization, reweighting premise without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal answer: hush as internal clock. Resonance from dream-listening friction avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature biased to glacial hush/nostalgia; syntax/rhythm modulate from dense lyricism to sparse closure cadence. Voice particularizes noticing (e.g., "escapements soft as eyelashes"). Purposeful compression taught early, legible payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (hush motifs accumulate purposefully). Minor overwrite in opening density (e.g., stacked jewels/fractures) but serves voice without obscuring cause or closure image. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms clockmaker trope via glacial hush premise into surrender arc; risk-taking lyric hush-measure risks gimmick but heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable particulars like verdigris myth make reconfigurations inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
