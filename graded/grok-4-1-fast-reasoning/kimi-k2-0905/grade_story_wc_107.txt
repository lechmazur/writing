<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied emotion peaks in "heart loosening like the ice outside, a slow internal melting," with contradictory impulses (fear vs. laugh) acting in scene and final abandonment earned by prior grief-warped crafting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via thawing pattern density to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "emotional tectonic shift that did not break her but realigned fault lines," with orientation anchored early in control room scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via chair fuel, tape seams, edge inspection; charges final image as "dripping quickened, rivulets conducting a metallic symphony that echoed her pulse."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Internal stake (grief-thaw) deepens accumulatively through laugh/crash/dome completion, narrowing to abandonment trade-off; cost felt in foreclosed carry-away plan, though textural subtlety tempers peak agency drive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of repurposed grief emerges organically via narration-as-soldering and dome-as-lighthouse; final "whispered an invitation: 'Enter, wonder, argue, forgive'" reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in glassblower's molten/edge focus; rhythmic prose modulates from dramatic narration to soft whisper, heightening internal pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in fire-taking, flowing in narration); thaw metaphors cohere without muddle, propelling to closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glassblower grief-craft in thawing station transforms abandonment trope; narration method risks lyric boldness, heightening stakes via internal release.</comment>
