<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Performer's moral ambiguity shown through past reporting/forging and present narration/whittling compels choices; contradictory impulses act in crow interaction and planting; final endurance earned with visible cost in log entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of whittling/narration tightening to Charged Poise closure; sky's tear and log line ("lightness possible, though not guaranteed") land on-page reconfiguration with conceptual cost of grief's weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Turbines constrain noise/rebellion (shavings snatched, feather lodged) and charge final image; dried bouquet evolves tactilely from cradle to plant; micro-setting (porch rail, wind stream) mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lightness in grief) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via crow's demand, officer's join, louder narration; agency in wooden feather offer narrows options with cost legible in stems planted and performance suspended.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of cultivating grief amid hush emerges organically from particulars; final bouquet dispersal and sky tear offer resonant non-literal answer reweighting "remade hush" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in blank narration ("blade kisses the grain"); stable close-third POV with biased noticing (turbines as giants); dialogue subtextual (officer's question forces reply), voices distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "shavings the wind turbines above snatched"); rhythmic variety, no loops; figurative language pattern-taught and coherent, propels to closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-mandate dystopia via whittling rebellions and crow dialogue; crow's "Whittle me a space where guilt fits like a splinter" turns prior ambiguity into inevitable reconfiguration.</comment>
