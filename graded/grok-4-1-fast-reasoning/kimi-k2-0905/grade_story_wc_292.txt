<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—nervous drumming vs. legacy-driven decoding—act simultaneously, earning her final renunciation of immediate return with the felt cost of an imprinted palm scar. Interiority particular via nail's pulse as second heartbeat. Voss as crucible forces pivotal alliance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from bled-ink stanzas to shield-map assembly to dirigible discovery, landing Charged Poise/CR closure where Mara rechristens nail as stylus despite granted reversal, cost legible in choosing memory over home. Orientation anchored early at plankwalk. One tightening at Voss confrontation narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring copper nail and weather (screaming barometers, spongey dread) constrain choices—dirigible launch only possible at dawn—and charge final etching image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: mildew honest vs. capital's denial. Weather evolves causally, mirroring internal flip.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping erased bravery to reverse exile—tightens accumulatively via decoded route overlay revealing wreck, forcing Voss alliance and dirigible risk. Agency in question to Voss forecloses erasure path; cost in palm imprint and chosen extended stay felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory as reversible jet stream emerges organically from inverted maps and final etching, reweighting erasure premise without statement; nail's verdigris reprise answers "bravery's coordinates" non-literally. Complexity in ministers' hypocrisy lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature: semaphore in ink bleeds, sky as library. Rhythmic prose modulates with pressure (short dawn sentences). Sparse dialogue goal-driven: question topples Voss threat. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (read-aloud flows); purposeful figurative pattern (spongey dread taught early) without muddle. Minor overwriting density in decoding stanza slightly slows mid-beat, but closure image sharp. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather-as-archive, salt-cipher micro-maps, Reversible Exile Act transforms legacy trope; bold risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens closure without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight via nail's verdigris thumbprint confirmation.</comment>
