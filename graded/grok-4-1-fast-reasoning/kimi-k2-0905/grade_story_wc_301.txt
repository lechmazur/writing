<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and embodied emotion, with contradictory impulses (guilt vs. chronicle) acting in descent and stream immersion; final renunciation of accordion earned by mapped sins and withdrawal rawness. Micro-choices like aligning bellows reveal values hierarchy with cost. No diagnostic labels flatten crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from platform graffiti to chamber stream, culminating in Charged Poise closure where accordion release reconfigures forgiveness as "bearing," with legible cost in lost instrument and "lungs lighter." Orientation anchored by ~100 words; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (weeping bricks, mica flecks) constrain choices—pried plank reveals stairs, stream bites and carries accordion—charging final ivy-applauding image. POV bias filters via river chronicler lens; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness via spring chronicle) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through stirred memories and recitation, forcing agency in stream immersion; cost unmistakable in accordion's departure and fractured reflection. Escalation driven by her micro-choices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as navigation emerges organically from map sins, graffiti ("water remembers"), and stream carrying guilt; final image reweights premise without moralizing—"river inside her kept speaking, and she finally answered."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (river metaphors, pulsing world); rhythmic prose modulates under stress, prose-as-character in "wheeze echoing off wet stone." No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, varied rhythm; purposeful lyric metaphors cohere without muddle, payoff in peak stream beat. Minor repetition of "bellows patched with tape" voice-motivated, not looping; no scaffold obscures closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of withdrawal journey, underground spring chronicle, and accordion release transforms redemption trope; risk-taking lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, ivy/station particulars irreplaceable.</comment>
