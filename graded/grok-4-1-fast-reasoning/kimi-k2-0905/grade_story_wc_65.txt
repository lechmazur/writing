<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority peaks in frostbite whitening skin and sequential memory losses (peaches, mother's voice, name), driving contradictory surrender impulses; final choice earned with visible cost, though some realizations border diagnostic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery density builds to Conceptual Repricing in her folding into the blank page and question-mark crack; on-page cost legible in final line's reconfiguration of futures.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen lake and obsidian spire constrain ascent and writing deadline, charging closure via unmarked surface cracking; sensory hierarchy (teeth ache from hum, crystallizing breath) filters through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seed one future pre-dawn) tightens texturally via escalating sacrifices (warmth, memories), forcing renunciation; agency in mid-air writing forecloses paths with legible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of ignorance/constraint as innovation's vacuum emerges organically from particulars, reweighted non-literally in final line ("space where futures grow"); resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice delivers distinct perceptual signature (shadows rewriting territory, futures as potential constellations); stable single-POV distance modulates with intensity, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but stacked metaphors in climax ("drinking... warmth... weight, shadow, heartbeat") border coherence strain; minor paraphrase loops in constraint motif dull propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of cartography as ignorance-clearing transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in lyric CR heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via quill's dissolution.</comment>
