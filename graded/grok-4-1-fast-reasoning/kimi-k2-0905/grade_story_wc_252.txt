<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's contradictory impulses—tenderness foreign yet coiling like hawsers—act in scene via pressing scrimshaw and singing war cry/lullaby, earning final renunciation of bone with visible emotional cost as old scars dissolve into new birth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tremor to whale call to communal song, landing Charged Poise closure in raft spiral and scrimshaw sinking, with cost legible in "old ground dissolved into foam."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe constrains descent and communal shallows entry; barnacled ladder, breathing rocks, and spray constrain choices, charging final whale breach image where reflection reconfigures freedom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor island via true nature) signaled early, escalates via whale call deepening that forces song/renunciation, driven by Lira's agency; cost unmistakable in island root snap and legacy dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of detaching cruelty for combative tenderness emerges implicitly from scrimshaw unlocking to raft birth; final reflection in spray offers non-literal answer reweighting violence myth without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in dock-honed grace and brine-salted senses; rhythmic compression heightens under whale vibration, elision of backstory taught early and paid in song.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and sensory propulsion; figurative language like "swans bred from violence" patterns early as voice, clarifying rather than muddling climax song/raft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pirate scrimshaw unlocking post-violence detachment via whale call transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric accumulative island-raft risks heightens stakes, inevitable in horizon chase.</comment>
