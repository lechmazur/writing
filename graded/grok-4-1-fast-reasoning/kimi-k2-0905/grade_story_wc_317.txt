<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion like pulse matching the storm and receptive skin to pulp compelling her choices. Contradictory impulses—fear of entrapment vs. expanding possibility—act simultaneously, earning her acceptance of mutation. Final realization at the envelope proves change with cycle's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from seed planting to architectural rewrite and cycle revelation. Orientation anchors early (Mira, mill by brook, storm night). Closure as CR lands on-page in "Tomorrow’s envelope... teaching a haven to write its own riddles," reweighting premise with endless mutation cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like cold air from glass floor cavity constrain planting and charge reversal of brook's flow. POV bias filters through Mira's puzzle-designer lens (gears like teeth). Final backward brook as quiet ally mirrors internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (plant before thunderclap or trapped) signaled early, tightens via growth's demand forcing guidance of vines as clues. Agency in sprinting to levers narrows options with rewrite cost. Escalation accumulates to guests' pollination, charging cycle under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of innovation via orthogonal mutation emerges organically from seed's roots threading architecture and shadows of future labyrinths. Final CR reweights "mystery seed mail" non-literally as self-writing haven, lingering without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices orthogonal angles and vegetal pulse. Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, compressing under storm stress. Guests' "Midnight" shout carries goal-driven subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied syntax, but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "walls swelling like gills" slightly muddles peak growth beat. No loops or scaffolds; purposeful recurrences like "storm-born silence" build texture. Read-aloud rhythm supports Accumulative cadence to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: corpse flower transforms escape room into living, self-rewriting cycle via orthogonal geometry and reversed brook. Risky meta-turn on seed mail as premise reweights inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
