<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority shines in micro-choices like pinning the fragment and discarding assumptions, embodying contradiction between mandate and evidence; tears at "each finale as merely the fold" earn the final renunciation of conclusions with visible cost in lighter coat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from shard discovery to tuning revelation; orientation anchors instantly on catwalk/Tower 7; closure as CR lands cleanly when shard dissolves into "soft click," reweighting silence with conceptual cost of sublimated gold and reborn voices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bloated moon and swaying girders constrain choices, mirroring internal vacancy; final gorge "pregnant with every voice" charges closure image, with sensory hierarchy (humming antennas, tingling skin) filtered through interpreter's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tune hush before it consumes transmissions) deepens accumulatively as shard magnetizes to fragment, heartbeat emerges; agency in tuning forecloses threat with cost of fragment's photon sublimation, legible in tears and balanced tower.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of endings as "hinge" emerges organically via hush cocoon and tape loops; final "needle finding the groove" reweights premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (dust motes as "slow-motion waltzes"); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive inhale to charged click, stable third-limited POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (fragment on coil slides "like a cat to a hearth"); purposeful lyric metaphors taught early avoid muddle, propulsion peaks at "sunrise bottled inside vacuum tubes" without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic silence as protective shard with Hollywood relic transforms tropes; risk-taking in poetic sci-fi practicality heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via tape-loop revelation.</comment>
