<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to capture sparks from corpses roots deeply in personal losses, culminating in earned self-realization when her face appears in the emerald; contradictory impulses between saving others and self-sacrifice act on-page. Interiority concrete via patterns harvested from 342 corpses. Final choice forecloses her life with felt cost, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from practice to infusion to dispersal, with CR closure when emerald reveals her spark and she steps into pool, cost legible in "one life surrendered to keep...sparks alive." Orientation anchored early in grotto. No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint of oblivion shapes final image, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto and mirror pool constrain choices (kneeling, stepping in) and charge final dispersal; aurora evolution mirrors internal shift from spectacle to recognition. Sensory details (dripping starlight, violet sheets) filtered through POV's pattern-seeking bias. Environment shapes tactics and closure image, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture spark) signaled early, escalates via infusion deepening to self-realization reversal narrowing options to sacrifice; agency in pressing chip to sternum forces trade-off under Accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable in dispersal seeding constellations. Escalation driven by protagonist, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of beauty ferrying against forgetting emerges organically from infusion patterns and final lantern-becoming-river image, reweighting premise without moral. Resonance from particulars like rigor mortis maps; no tidy resolution, lingering ambiguity in "new lungs." Satisfies 9+ test via non-literal ending answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, with perceptual signature of static patterns and bioluminescence; rhythm modulates from hushed observation to peak dispersal intensity. Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. Distinct diction under stress, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "rigor mortis traced maps across cooling flesh" advances world/character/stakes); varied rhythm flows read-aloud, no loops or muddled metaphors despite density. Propulsion aligns with lyric accumulation to charged close. Zero artifacts in peak beats, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Beautician mortician premise synthesizes mortuary craft and fantasy in non-obvious dragon-tear chip and corpse constellations; risk in full lyric dispersal heightens stakes organically. Fresh inflections like self-as-ferryman inevitable from particulars. Bold vision transforms tropes, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
