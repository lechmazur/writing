<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's watchful dreamer nature drives concrete micro-choices like kneeling at the server and recording the second confession, with embodied tension in "throat tightened" revealing contradictory vulnerability; Elias as secondary applies relevant pressure via the proffered tablet. Final endurance of leaving namelessly feels earned by prior viral wound exposure. Minor abstraction in early interiority ("wound inside her had begun to taste like metal") borders therapy-speak but anchors present action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via dripping icicles and moss growth patterns, holds through density increase to Charged Poise closure in burying the drive and pendant's ant shadow projecting promise—reconfiguring scream-to-seed with conceptual cost of "labels are frost." Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Mira entering post-viral data center). Single scene, one tightening via Elias's arrival narrowing to shared planting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (thawing icicles' "slow Morse," moss "emerald carpets," dew-dark hoodie) filter through Mira's priorities, constraining choices like centering on lichen-flowered server for burial and charging final image with cracked skylight projection. Atmosphere of "honeyed hush" tensions external sirens, mirroring internal healing. Micro-setting (pendant, server mound) evolves causally, lived-in via trailing fingers and palm-packing soil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grafting meaning onto viral wound via second confession/seed) signaled early, tightens accumulatively with Elias's tablet offer forcing vulnerable recording and burial under external sirens; agency in proffering pendant to camera forecloses isolation path with felt relational cost in nameless departure. One deepening suffices, cost legible in "absorbing the city’s electric panic into peat."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wounds-to-growth emerges organically from confession-scream to seed-planting, ant's patience reweighting mentor-trauma via charged final image of shadow on mound without moralizing; subtext in silent understanding and buried drive invites ambiguity on digital permanence. Resonance from particulars like moss-circuits ties to conceptual cost of small survival amid collapse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV on Mira with perceptual signature (silences as seeds, drips as cadence) modulating rhythmically to quieter hush; voice texture distinct in syntax like "she stayed vulnerably protected," consistent under low-stress lyric mode. No dialogue on page to judge, but recorded speech feels natural/subtextual. Purposeful compression taught early via motifs pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm and strong verbs ("slipped," "trailed," "knelt"); motifs like "drip" recur purposefully without loops. Figurative density ("golden tear housing one trapped ant") consistent and voice-motivated but risks overwrite in opening beat (-0.4), though clarity holds at closure burial. No scaffold, scaffold, or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of viral confession in post-blackout moss-data-center transforms trauma tropes via ant-pendant patience and buried USB-seed; risk-taking in lyric hush amid sirens heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight at shadow-projection reconfiguring collapse survival.</comment>
