<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in sensory details like "metal sweat under green fingers" and dream hesitation reveal contradictory impulses; final transcendence earned via prior dream causality with skin-melt cost. Minor slip: voice-over epiphanies like “Decay is only a directive..." border unearned without sharper micro-choice friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density (vines, water melody, leaf minutes) builds to CR closure in "Continuity is the art of letting go," reweighting directive with bunker-shedding cost legible in final seed image. Orientation anchored early (bunker entry by para 1); no lens ambiguity, single-shard lyric structure fits defaults with taught pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vine-draped bunker and "precisely playful" corridors constrain choices (tilts balance her, vines braid rungs) and charge final image (bunker as "vine-draped heart"). Sensory hierarchy (rust taste, dripping melody) reflects POV urgency; evolves causally with storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover path-walker mutuality) signaled early, escalates via storm-deepening (dream bird to cataract climb) under Accumulative lens, narrowing to consent-choice with seal-skin cost. Agency in offering dream-bird to storm forecloses prior continuity; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mutual becoming emerges organically from particulars (footprints choose devouring path, directive rewrites to lullaby); final CR image ("walkers and paths are one another’s becoming") non-literally answers vine question without moralizing, reweighting decay as freedom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing ("ceiling tiles sagging in calculated arcs"); rhythmic syntax modulates with storm intensity, stable single POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "wafer seal melted into a second skin, its circuits branching blue"); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in peak storm ("storm’s first fist punches") risks coherence but pattern-taught avoids penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of sci-fi directive with lyric rewilding (bunker undresses into growing heart) transforms tropes via name/attribute specificity; risk-taking in elliptical transcendence heightens stakes, feels inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
