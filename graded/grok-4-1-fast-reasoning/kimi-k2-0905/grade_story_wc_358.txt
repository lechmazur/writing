<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete embodiment ("patch pulse against her heart like borrowed time") and micro-choices under pressure ("writing backward, reversing every arrow"); contradictory impulses emerge in predictive echo forcing adaptation; final endurance earned with visible cost in reversed stride.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening to plaza convergence; CR closure lands on-page ("patch lifted, hovered, and dissolved") with conceptual cost in predictive reversal reweighting premise; orientation anchored early at gate, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (vectors guide path through leaning stacks) and charges final image (glass circle hums, scorches sentences); sensory hierarchy sharpens via professional bias (wind signatures as "ribbon of powdered paint"); micro-object (patch) functions as setting in twitching reprise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate foresight) signaled early, escalates texturally via haze thickening and predictive voice narrowing options; agency in laying patch and reverse-writing forecloses prior path with legible cost ("containers shifted, corridors realigning").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of predictive listening emerges organically from vectors/echo/reversal, resonant non-literal answer in final image ("walked backward... each step arrived just after the ground decided"); recharges prior material without moralizing; earned complexity in adaptation's ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("treating the maze as a wind instrument") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from precise notes to charged compression at plaza; stable single POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines ("snapped on latex gloves, the snap echoing"); varied rhythm/read-aloud ear passes; figurative language purposeful and coherent ("fossilized lung exhaling") without muddle in peak plaza beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of inverted-time port and predictive wind feels inevitable via grounded vectors/echo; bold surreal risks (reverse walking, scorched headlines) heighten stakes coherently; fresh inflection in patch's dissolution reconfiguring witness role.</comment>
