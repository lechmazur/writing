<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between methodical certainty ("sure strokes of rabbit-skin glue") and curiosity tilt act simultaneously; final renunciation of certainty earned via awakenings with embodied cost in softened edges.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through nested folds and awakenings; CR closure legible in "edges soften; she was simultaneously kneeling, walking, and yet unborn" with conceptual cost of endless exchange.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sound wave garden constrains via "silver ribbon that wrapped Liora’s wrists and tugged"; recurring spoon and stones charge final image, sensory hierarchy sound-dominant and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Awakening deepenings under accumulative lens narrow certainty option, agency in tapping ribbon forces trade-off; cost unmistakable in "pure inquiry" flakes sealing open edges.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of traded certainties emerges organically via barter whisper to nested revelations; final "path that curved out of sight" reweights premise without moral, resonant via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical texture with sound-biased perception ("hummed into a silver spoon") distinct and stable; rhythmic control modulates surreal pressure without head-hopping or elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in "inverted wave passed, color drained... into possibility"; figurative pattern (sound visualized) coherent, zero loops, propulsion matches scene cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Hobo nickel transforms coin trope into "city’s coinage of attention"; surreal folding/nesting synthesis inevitable from sound motif, bold risks heighten stakes coherently.</comment>
