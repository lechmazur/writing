<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—skeptic shrug versus chest-cleft yearning—act in scene through tooth-handling and path-following, earning her final renunciation of erasure with visible cost in the widening door. Traits shown particular via bone-setting memory constraining choices. No unearned epiphanies; change credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from reflective opening to path revelation and tooth placement as CR closure, reweighting certainty with conceptual cost in garden shiver and rewoven hedges. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via briar path suffices. Persistent tooth constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden's bruised mint/iron, bone pavers, and vertebra sundial constrain choice (follow path) and charge final image (hedges rewoven). Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward bone memory; details evolve causally with events, mirroring internal fractures without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cleft resolution) signaled early, tightens via changeling/map into agency-driven placement foreclosing erasure path; cost felt in "grow stronger at the angle of its wounding." Accumulative escalation reweights under lens with undeniable pear fertilization reprise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of lies-as-lanterns emerges organically from changeling's tender fraud and pear-rebirth image, offering non-literal answer via tooth-in-jaw constellation reweighting missteps. Complexity embraced in forgiveness-lie ambiguity; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with bone-perceptual signature stable in single POV; diction/rhythm modulate intensity, compressing at peak ("felt the cleft... widen into a door"). Changeling dialogue subtextual, goal-driven; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies, no loops/artifacts, but figurative density borders overwriting in opening ("dim star," "cleft... through her chest") slightly dulls early propulsion without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh changeling inversion—fraud nurtures while "true" sleeps—synthesizes folkloric tropes into bone-constellation frame, risking lyric accrual that heightens stakes via irreplaceable tooth-map payoff.</comment>
