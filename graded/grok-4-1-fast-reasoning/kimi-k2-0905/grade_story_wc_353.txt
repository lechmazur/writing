<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ilay's symphonically minded trait and empathy craft compel escalating micro-choices like mapping cracks as pitches and breathing with the wood's pulse, earning her final reconfiguration without unearned epiphany. Contradictory impulses emerge in fierce motivation versus trembling knees at closure. Interiority embodied in fingertips hovering and heart slowing to arboreal time.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from analysis to strumming fissures, culminating in Charged Poise closure: grove joins song, reweighting silence with cost in Ilay's restrained bow and trembling. Orientation anchored in opening lines. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Recurring alder statue constrains choices, from ear to chest to propping dulcimer on knees, charging final exhale and moss brightening. Sensory hierarchy (vibrations, resin scent, cold wood) reflects symphonic urgency. Spatial choreography coherent in circling the sculpture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive music pre-forgetting) signaled early, escalates via density shift as strums coax cracks to widen, forcing endurance with visible cost in statue's millimeter mouth-open and Ilay's knees trembling. Agency in arpeggio climbing ivy-like.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow-to-comfort emerges organically via particulars like siskin-wing crack shifting to flight potential, final image reweighting silence as "conversation—tree to bird to soil to her own blood" without moralizing. Resonance from prior motifs like dead wire voices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature: fractures as pitches, cracks as constellations. Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from hush to expectancy, purposeful in "intensely quiet moment before the downbeat." No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line layers sensory/propulsive work, e.g., "strums the insulator’s rim—one clear, glassy ping that ricochects." Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors consistent (cracks as ivy, wing). Closure image undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: insulators as eggs/nests, dulcimer from reclaimed wire transform tropes into symphonic revival. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from opening hush to closing mercy-tremble. No derivative echoes.</comment>
