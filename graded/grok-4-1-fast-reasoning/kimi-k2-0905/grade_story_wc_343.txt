<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira's micro-choices under isolation pressure—tracing uncharted lines, noting hopscotch spirals despite dust and dimming—earn her pivotal reading aloud, revealing hierarchy of curiosity over fear with embodied shake. Internal conflict in sociable exclusion acts simultaneously with diligent pursuit. Minor poetic generality in epiphanic lift at end avoids higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of patterns (starlings, spirals, chalk) tightens to reading climax, yielding resonant reconfiguration (isolation lifts, ship inhales) with felt cost of prior faltering made legible in "lamps burning with a story." Orientation anchored early in chart-room. Single tightening sufficient for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hopscotch board and copper pipes constrain choices (patterns translated, light-feed sparked), charging final shared horizon image. Sensory hierarchy via cartographer's eye (creaking ribs, flour-fine dust, pale steam) selective and POV-biased. Evolving details mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ship's memory/discovery amid isolation) signaled early via dimming; textural escalation deepens via pattern accumulation to agency in reading, narrowing to trade-off (voice despite knees) with cost in near-ghosting. Charges final drawing. Early abstraction slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of language as light/path emerges implicitly via spirals/phrases reweighting isolation to connection, answered non-literally in "after-image of hope" lingering post-murmuration. Subtext in silences and nods; no moralizing. Starlings' helix mirrors without shouting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with cartographer's perceptual signature (patterns in birds, scuffs, chalk) biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from creaking calm to sprint urgency. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("light-feed runs on stories"). No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "shadows pooled like spilled ink around her boots" advances atmosphere/action); varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor overwriting in metaphor density (e.g., "stranded luminance flickering") purposeful for textural lens but risks coherence in non-peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: story-powered airship revived via linguistic hopscotch patterns transforms steampunk tropes organically. Risky magical realism (dead dialects ignite light) heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via mother's scrap priming closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
