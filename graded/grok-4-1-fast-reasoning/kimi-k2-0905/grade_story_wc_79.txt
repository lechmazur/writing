<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's quietly driven obsession shown through persistent piping amid dread and screams, with embodied pulse hammering and contradictory sunwashed dread; final whistle drop earns renunciation with visible cost, rooted in mother's log.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds via tremor-to-atlas match, cracked note, and piped question yielding CR revelation; cost legible in "new, terrible chart" reconfiguring city's path and future wanderers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shells and carapaces constrain climbs and piping while charging final clatter on warm carapace; sensory hierarchy (tremor up spine, frayed harmonics tasting iron) filters through cartographer's pattern bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to chart watchers averting Crack tightens via tremor match and cracked note forcing city veer; agency in altering sequence narrows options with merchants' screams as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of protective silence emerges implicitly via geode glimpse reweighting gate's purpose; final chart image offers non-literal answer without moralizing, embracing costs of knowledge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern languages and spiral motifs; rhythmic modulation peaks in "cracking it in half so the sound frayed into harmonics that tasted of iron," legible under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, and dread without loops; figurative cluster ("tide carves continents grain by grain") purposeful in opening, propels to closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Turtle-shell city and archived watchers synthesize fresh navigational mythos; risk in pattern-driven causality heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via atlas-slit match.</comment>
