<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular through embodied memories (lungs taste iron) and contradictory endurance under exhaustion; final dissolution of ache earned by etching progression. Contradictory impulses in hurrying despite buckling knees act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory etchings build density to RR/CR closure where "ache dissolved" reconfigures home as mapped spiral, cost in crumbling shell and exhaustion hit legible at final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass spire and frozen lake constrain etching/conducting and reflect upside-down clefs, charging final image; nautilus shell as tool shapes tactics across beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve homesickness) signaled early, escalates via accumulating etchings/responses tightening time to exhaustion; agency in pressing shell forecloses path with knees buckling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of looped fortunes/memories as home emerges organically; final child-with-nautilus image offers resonant CR repricing without moral, reweighting symphonies as embedded bubbles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in musical synesthesia (B-flat resonates frost); rhythmic control modulates from etching precision to silence ringing, POV stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (clef like breaking wave) taught early pays off in closure; minor density overload in third movement chord but propels without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of fortunes, nautilus, spire transforms homesickness into conducted symphony; risk in patterned elision heightens stakes coherently to child-hearing closure.</comment>
