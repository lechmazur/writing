<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like switching to glacier recording amid adaptation; embodied emotions (velvet migraine, sweat on lips) particular. Minor slip: internal conflict more implied than simultaneous impulses acting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: probes test, she counters, tricksters adapt, she pivots to chaos method, leading to peak hush (DC) with cost (feedback howl, dim lights). Orientation anchored early (Lyra at station post-midnight). Closure reconfigures with felt price in final hush and town calming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via generator, photocell to moon, transmitter; charges closure with palm to cooling metal feeling civility. Sensory hierarchy sharp (subsonic in kneecaps, copper taste). Quad divide via livestream integrates without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scramble deceit by 02:17) tightens via agency-driven reversal: sine fails, glacier chaos counters adaptation, foreclosing certainty with SWR red/feedback cost. Escalation causal under lens, costs alter tactics visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: cosmic-fueled division paused by gritty interference, resonant in final image of planet's heartbeat and charts as futures. Non-literal answer to power plays via "interference... word for love"; complexity in paused-not-won harmony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (subsonics as tremors/migraines); rhythmic control modulates pressure (whining capacitors to feedback howl). Voice distinct in ethereal grit diction, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm/syntax; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative coherent/purposeful in peaks ("gritty lullaby," "ghost brawl"), but minor density strain in climax images slightly risks muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: subsonic cosmic tricksters fueling division countered by glacier chaos on radio tower; risks bold (ice pops as carrier) heighten stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
