<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nilo's micro-choices under pressure (easing throttle to teach silence) reveal contradictory impulses toward hush and facilitation, earning the commuter's release and Nilo's solitary endurance; commuter as pressure source forces Nilo's adaptation without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build (crystals, wind, confession) to Charged Poise/CR closure in final image of vial's silhouettes and drifting wait, with conceptual cost of Nilo's private constellation legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prism terrace and grafted dial constrain choices (hexagons for boarding, slowing gondola); final cloud-sea mirror charges closure image, with sensory hush (decibels, humming glass) filtered through Nilo's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silence-as-comfort stake signaled early tightens via crystal dissolution forcing speech, with agency (Nilo's whisper, throttle) and felt cost (commuter lighter, Nilo burdened) under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silence reconfigured as "breathing corridor" emerges from vial particulars and confession, with final heart-train alignment offering non-literal resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature (hush obsession) with rhythmic hush modulation; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("voice the loudest thing") advances plot without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied rhythm (short hush beats, flowing descriptions); purposeful figures (wind "seamstress") integrate without muddle, zero loops, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh sky-gondola silence therapy via crystallizing fears transforms transit trope; poetic hush voice risks bold synthesis, inevitable in hindsight via vial's evolving constellation.</comment>
