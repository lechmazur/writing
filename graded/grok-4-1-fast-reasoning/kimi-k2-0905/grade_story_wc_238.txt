<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via music-specific embodiment (apology "clung to her tongue like rosin"); contradictory impulses in banishing pain yet seeking reconnection earn final "I was wrong." Flaw of past mistake compounds into present struggle without hedging. Micro-choices like aligning bottle with clef reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (dust arpeggios, hum lament) builds to RR closure in drop falling on ghost's palm, reconfiguring silence with cost (empty bottle, fading ghost). Orientation anchored early (archive, hush, headlines). No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint of flawed drop shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Archive micro-setting constrains via current guiding hand to folder and bottle aligning with clef; orchard outside charges timeframe. Sensory hierarchy music-POV filtered (iron filings, unplayed sonatas). Final tree fall recharges low E rattle. 9+ gate: recurring shelf/object shapes choice/closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnect/apologize) signaled early, tightens texturally as failed drop refusal forces speech, deepening to ghost emergence. Agency in bowing air and "I was wrong" forecloses path with cost (resonance kept, miracle emptied). Escalation coherent under lens, cost unmistakable in fading with scent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of forgiven silence emerges organically from particulars (rest note, play the rest); final lilac bloom reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in pizzicato whisper and swirling notation invites ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from grief-as-dissonance. Resonant non-literal answer in echo kept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (music metaphors: brittle chord, pizzicato whispers); rhythmic control modulates intensity. Ghost dialogue sparse, subtextual, distinct idiom. No head-hopping; diction biased to exorcist worldview. Elision of past taught early, paid in present actions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (notes lift into cyclone); metaphors coherent/music-patterned, no muddle in peak (drop soak "like ink into blotting paper"). Minor figurative density in opening but taught/payoff at climax avoids overwriting penalty. Zero loops; varied rhythm reads aloud smoothly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of gossip-exorcist, flawed 1892 perfume, archive currents transforms ghost reunion trope. Risky ethereal prose heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via music logic. Bold closure image (lilac in felled orchard) commits fully without retreat.</comment>
