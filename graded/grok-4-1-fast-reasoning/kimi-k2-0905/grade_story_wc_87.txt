<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in choosing pole lights over charts despite shoals; final endurance earned by prior micro-choices like reciting mantra amid wake. Contradictory impulses act in scene with laugh-sob-toast revealing flawed competence. 9+ test met: hierarchy of values in ignoring "paper apologies."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of regrets and pole navigation builds to Charged Poise closure where compass pressed to chest reconfigures reliance with felt cost of foreclosed certainty. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity. 9+ test met: persistent constraint of broken compass shapes tactics to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Poles as recurring micro-setting constrain choices (aligning despite shoals) and charge final beacon wink; sensory selectivity (brine-forgiveness taste, wire hum) reflects POV urgency. Body gash from compass slide integrates environment into action. 9+ test met: poles guide to open sea image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcome regrets to align heart/action) signaled early tightens accumulatively via fog erasing poles, forcing echo-navigation; agency in paddling "yes, yes" forecloses chart-trust with cost of uncharted sea. One decisive deepening sufficient; cost legible in "tear charts into confetti."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of faith over instruments emerges organically from pole-constellations to dolphin guides reweighting regrets; final image offers non-literal answer via "widening yes" without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like mantra tasting "brine and forgiveness." 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in merrily melancholic metaphors (pain as "percussion"); rhythmic modulation accelerates with strokes spelling "yes, yes." Stable close-third POV with biased noticing (stars silent, poles singing). 9+ test met: no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "paddle blades flickering faith across black water"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language pattern-taught early pays off without muddle in peak fog/dolphin beat. 9+ test met: propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of utility poles as "constellations by electricians" transforms navigation trope; bold lyric risk heightens stakes via bioluminescent dolphins without gimmickry. Inevitable hindsight from regrets' "recalibration" to open-sea poise.</comment>
