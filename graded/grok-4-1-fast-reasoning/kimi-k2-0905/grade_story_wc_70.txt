<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's truthful curse creates embodied contradiction, peaking when she whispers the lie to spark lightning, earning her change with job-risk cost. Internal conflict acts simultaneously in ascent and summit choice. Boy applies brief crucible pressure without diluting her drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from booth hush to summit bolt, yielding Charged Poise closure where hive reanimates and gate opens with felt routine-cost. Riddles motivate causal ellipsis without breaks; orientation anchors early in booth/tower.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tower's copper cones and sealed hive constrain ascent/choice, charging final orbiting coins and warm matchbox image. Nectar dusk recurs purposefully, mirroring internal states through POV-filtered ozone and wax. Sensory hierarchy narrows under ascent urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wonder-preservation stake signaled early tightens via riddles to lie-agency at summit, foreclosing truthful stasis with lightning cost under Accumulative lens. One decisive deepening narrows options; moral calculus (lie vs truth) charges peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Wonder-through-lie theme emerges from bee/lightning motifs shifting at revival, offering non-literal resonant answer in unlatched gate without moralizing. Particulars like wax puddles reweight routine's fragility organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "rust look sweet") biases noticing toward wonder; rhythmic prose modulates with ascent intensity. Stable third-limited POV; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual in truthful exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm; no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Figurative pattern (nectar dusk, copper bees) taught early coheres without muddle, though slight density thickens summit beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of truthful curse, drone bees, lightning tower transforms tropes; lie-sparked revival feels inevitable from prior particulars. Bold poetic risks heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
