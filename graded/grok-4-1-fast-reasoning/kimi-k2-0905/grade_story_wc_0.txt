<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (frantic grief vs. cosmic patience) act in scene through storm-ignoring persistence; final renunciation of outrunning storms earned by data convergence and overlay match. Embodied emotion concrete (boots squelching, water sluicing gloves). Interiority particular to researcher (fractals encoding time).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns builds to pinged convergence and CR closure where "felt no urge to outrun the next storm" makes cost legible in personal grief repricing. Orientation anchored para 1. Single scene fits defaults perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Environment constrains choices (works by headlamp as lights fail, rain on gloves) and charges final image (greenhouse collapse mirroring "slow collapse"). Sensory vivid and POV-biased (researcher notes "molecular accretion" in dust). Micro-setting (synchrotron, forceps) integrates seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (validate gradual change mapping) signaled early, escalates via accumulating patterns and storm pressure to deepening at overlay match narrowing drama options. Agency in persistence forecloses frantic grief path with felt cost. Single tightening sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image ("carrying a butterfly’s quiet thesis") offers resonant CR reweighting catastrophe as "reel of film" without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from scale overlays and greenhouse mirror. No Thematic Echo; ambiguity in grief acceptance lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (cosmic scaling in "cobalt fire," "miniature galaxy"). Rhythm modulates with pressure (short sentences at ping: "convergence achieved"). Voice distinct, scientific-poetic without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful (layered scales as tree rings) without muddle, taught early and paying off in fractals. Propulsion clear, overwriting absent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of butterfly dust and neutron star decay transforms scientist-in-ruins trope via specific algo calibration. Risky cosmic-micro overlay feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
