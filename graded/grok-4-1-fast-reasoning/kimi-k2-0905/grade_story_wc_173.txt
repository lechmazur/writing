<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in "pulse feel like betrayal" and pelvic vibrations compel chaste renunciation at closure; final choice to remain and sing earned by prior micro-choices like whispering defiance. Interiority particular via "blood answer in iambs." No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: poetic density builds from arrival to unlocking, pattern break in core's mirror darkness yields CR closure with cost in "freedom, too, can be a terrifying lullaby." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity. One tightening via knot release suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Silver courtyard snow hisses and retreats to reveal mosaics, constraining ritual and mirroring predecessors' failure to charge her stakes; final thawing tiles and fountain evolve causally, grounding bodily poetic. Sensory hierarchy (hums, tastes iron/lilacs) selective via POV urgency. Recurring quartz/prism constrains unlocking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy lullaby) tightens accumulatively via echo-braiding to core exhale, narrowing to step into void; agency in plucking threads forecloses contract with felt cost in blood/dew prints and chosen chastity. Escalation driven by her micro-choices; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of conformity's chains vs. freedom's terror emerges organically from echo-scattering and contract's ash; final dawn's "raw, alarming serenity" reweights premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like mercury tears into stars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in bodily filters ("vibrated in her pelvic bones"); rhythmic refrain "between sigh and smile" taught early, modulates to charged poise at ending. Lyrical compression legible under accumulative lens, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (veins mapping heart) woven into action, but figurative density in unlocking beat borders overwrite without muddle (-0.4); no loops, strong propulsion via varied rhythm. Closure image ("tiny stars that orbited her throat") clear and vivid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-theft echoes into liberation ritual transforms courtesan trope via bodily poetic; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, with prism collapse inevitable from prior threads. No derivative echoes; bold premise commitment.</comment>
