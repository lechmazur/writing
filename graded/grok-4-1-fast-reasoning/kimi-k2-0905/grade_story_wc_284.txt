<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (prudent paralysis to daring) act in scene via micro-choices like jump-starting the hatch and crushing the pillbox; final renunciation earned by prior silence's cost, embodied in scarred nerves and bleeding knee.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of snow/mist/courage images builds to Charged Poise closure (transmit then crush pillbox), cost legible in "grinding the portrait into the snow"; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Snow crust, briars, wind-turbine constrain choices (uncover slate, power transmitter); final snowdrop charges image, mirroring internal shift; sensory hierarchy (mist swallows footfalls, iron taste) selective via spy's thawing numbness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmit proof to fix broken lives) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to transmit choice narrowing options; agency in decoding snow and crushing pillbox, cost visible in heel-grind and knee bandage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Snowdrop as white flag reconfigures "gardeners of possible futures" premise without moralizing; courage/snow motif emerges organically from particulars, resonant non-literal answer in slush prints and tilted light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (numb cheek, thawing thumb) biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from hush to groan/shiver under pressure; purposeful compression in micro-code reveal teaches lyric pattern paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "mist parted just enough to reveal a single snowdrop" does image/foreshadow/charge; varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, figurative consistency (silver hush motif) enhances without muddle in peak transmit beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Spy trope transformed via snow-code fieldcraft and pillbox battery trick into lyric reconfiguration of courage; fresh synthesis of bluff micro-setting and "prudently daring" calculus feels inevitable, risks poetic density coherently.</comment>
