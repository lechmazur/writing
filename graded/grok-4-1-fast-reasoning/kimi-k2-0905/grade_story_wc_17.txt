<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's sensitivity compels micro-choices like pressing palm to stone and descending hatch, earning final endurance as corridor; contradictory pull of job vs. inheritance embodied in "name rise in her throat like a stone."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via layered discoveries to CR closure—Mira's transformation into "negative space," cost legible in "pull her inside out, turning her into a corridor"; orientation anchored early, pattern taught and holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage constrains path as "shutter," tunnel negatives brush face to charge reversal glimpses; recurring ivy/stone evolve causally, mirroring absorption in final empty-room negative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of echo-mapping deepens accumulatively to legacy confrontation, narrowing via diary/negative revelations; cost unmistakable in self-as-child scream frame forcing eternal loop.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Legacy's burden emerges organically through walls-as-camera, repriced in final breathing negative that reweights dreams with Mira's eternal witness cost; no moralizing, resonant via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable, perceptual signature in acoustic bias ("older frequencies—murmurs"); diction/rhythm modulate pressure, as in tunnel's "negatives brushing her face" sustaining immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with coherent metaphors ("corridors narrowing like clogged arteries"); varied rhythm propels, but dense figuration slightly risks opacity in sequential-glimpse beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Building-as-camera with time-reversal negatives synthesizes fresh inheritance horror, inevitable from early acoustics; bold CR risks absorption payoff without gimmick.</comment>
