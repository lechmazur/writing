<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (repair machines vs. restructure self) act in scene via sealing clock hand and boarding shuttle; final renunciation earned by mentor's warning revealed in photo, with cost of leaving constant orbit legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of spinning hand, leaf, shaking builds to CR closure at shutter click and station collapse, reweighting premise with undeniable cost of memory's drag; orientation anchored early, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lunar observatory's cracked lenses, spectrographs, airlock constrain choices (sealing hand, facing inward); leaf in vacuum charges surreal final image, POV-filtered through repairer's tactile bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harness ephemeral) signaled early, tightens via timer set by leaf sound forcing trade-off (capture vs. leave); agency in self-timer peaks at click, cost felt in upward rush and shuttle departure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of letting go emerges from particulars (clock blur frozen, station folds into photo); final image reconfigures repair/constant rule-set with conceptual cost of softer whir, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (luminous ache, whirring moth); rhythmic prose modulates from constant to charged poise, purposeful compression taught early and legible at leaf's orbit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (e.g., "bulkheads flexing like diaphragm blades"); no loops or muddled metaphors in peak shutter beat, varied rhythm propels to final whir at rest.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of camera/time metaphors (observatory as darkroom) feels inevitable; risk of impossible leaf orbiting pays off in charged closure without gimmickry.</comment>
