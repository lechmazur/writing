<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Elian's lunge then instant understanding from the paper slip, earning the collaborative turn with relational cost of rivalry foreclosed; mechanical arm embodies traits without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via symbol density (sundial, card, brook) culminating in RR closure at dusk ray aligning shadow, with legible conceptual cost of incomplete inquiry resolved; orientation anchored early in atrium.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sundial and brook constrain duel and revelation choices, charging final image as ray completes geometry; sensory details (whirring arm, glinting water) filter through Elian's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding overture tightens via Vale's slip narrowing rivalry to partnership, driven by Elian's agency in catching/pinning; cost unmistakable in "years of rivalry" sliced, reweighting under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of collaborative inquiry emerges organically from particulars, answered non-literally by shared chamber entry and floating card recharging motifs; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in brook's conversation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (gears ticking vs. shadows) and rhythmic diction modulate pressure; dialogue subtextual ("stitch time") advances without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but minor figurative density in duel ("foil singing," "syntax") borders overwrite without obscuring closure; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of philosophical duel via sundial code and mechanical arm transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in poetic texture heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
