<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in unrest as needle compel surrender and blood-pricking choice with embodied cost; interiority concrete via pollen-flaking skin and muttering couplets. Final endurance earned by prior causality, foreclosing plate's dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from kelp threads to stitched memories and self-blood, yielding Charged Poise CR in bridge/sea return with plate's dissolution as cost (e.g., "porcelain becoming shell"). Orientation anchors immediately; single dream-shard coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Labyrinth constrains choices (crumbling path to loom, switchbacks); recurring red walls/orchids charge final ledge image, mirroring internal renewal. Sensory hierarchy poetic-urgent (orchid solace narrowing to spilled milk moonlight).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore precedents/ruin to reverence) signaled early, tightens via blood-demanding optimism that forecloses plate and alters canyon. Agency in pricking palm narrows options with visible cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from weave (ruin/reverence couplets) to final non-literal image ("every reflection... orchid at its center") reweighting unmaking as half-weave. Resonance from particulars avoids morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in biased noticing (petroglyph whales urging, kelp-knotted unrest); rhythmic diction modulates with pressure (shortened stitches to expansive bridge). Purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "bleeding hauntingly optimistic red onto the orchids until they lifted") propels without loops; metaphors cohere (ivy of light sealing cracks) in pattern-taught poetic mode, no artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms labyrinth/sea tropes via plate-weaving dream-agency; risk in blood-optimism turn inevitable from prior unrest particulars, heightening stakes to sea's return.</comment>
