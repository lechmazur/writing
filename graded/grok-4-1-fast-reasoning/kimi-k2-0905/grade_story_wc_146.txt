<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation rooted in personal loss ("hollow inside his chest where his own bell once hung") compels sacrificial choice at climax, with embodied contradiction in offering his heart's rhythm. Interiority particular and pressure-tested through micro-choices like seven circuits. Final renunciation earned, foreclosing his individuality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via ritual walks and fork's evolving hum to RR closure: Elian fades into tenth bell with cost ("transparent at the edges"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening at north ward refusal narrows to personal sacrifice. Lens holds cleanly to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobblestones constrain method ("rhythm of footsteps") and charge closure; archway frames inciting strike and end. Sensory hierarchy (vibrations over visual) reflects POV urgency, evolving causally (dust swirls, timbers leap). Final bells poised reweight via tactile lived-in navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (town revival) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through circuits to north ward resistance, forcing agency in self-sacrifice that reweights with fork's shatter. One deepening forecloses easy harmony option; cost legible ("shattered into black sand"). Coheres under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of rhythmic forgiveness emerges via particulars: fork drinks footsteps, Elian gives heart for communal rebirth. Final image ("swaying slightly whenever the wind remembered to walk heel-toe") reweights premise non-literally, charging prior loss with resonance. No moralizing; ambiguity in his fade lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable, perceptual signature vibrational ("pressure behind the eyes"). Rhythm modulates with intensity (short sentences at strike); diction controlled, purposeful elision taught early pays in closure poise. No head-hopping; voice as character in musical syntax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines; rhythm varies (funeral march builds to "click nearly musical"). Minor fig density in rebuild ("stained glass flew in shards that fused midair") purposeful, no muddle or loops. Propulsion clear to final heel-toe echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Tempris tunes ghost town via footsteps and personal echo-sacrifice, transforming revival tropes organically. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; bold premise implications followed to Elian's fade without retreat. No derivative echoes.</comment>
