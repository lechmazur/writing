<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in silent recitation amid storm risk and final alignment choice earned by scar-cloud mapping; no unearned epiphanies, traits constrain upward dissolution over printers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening to ink dissolution and timer stop at "one second remaining"; CR closure via star-shaped stain reconfigures erasure into eternal orbit with conceptual cost of physical vanishing legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Observatory dome and darkroom constrain printing/revelation (lightning overexposes sheet), charge final image; storm weather tactilely mirrors/scar-maps internal welts, sensory hierarchy storm-narrowed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to archive poetry escalates via lightning revelation forcing upward broadcast over printers, agency in tearing/timing/dissolving forecloses earthly path; cost unmistakable in petri dish's "faint star-shaped stain" and disappearance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of orbiting erasure emerges via dissolving ink and scars-as-cartography without statement; final "cartography of scars redraws itself" non-literally answers censorship premise, reweighting prior images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable with perceptual signature (scars as meridians, storm as darkroom); rhythmic compression modulates to charged poise at "heartbeat held between beats," pattern-taught elisions legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (e.g., "reversed waterfalls" advances atmosphere/action); figurative coherence peaks without muddle in revelation beat, propulsion matches vigil pause-to-storm alignment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of darkroom alchemy and storm broadcast transforms censorship trope; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight via timetable-to-petri evolution.</comment>
