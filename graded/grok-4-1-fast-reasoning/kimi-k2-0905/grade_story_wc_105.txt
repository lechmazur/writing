<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in tasting iron and hearing forge as cello; contradictory impulses peak when complicity emerges alongside brother's betrayal, earning final renunciation of past-fixing with visible cost in orchard's rustle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of sensory imprints building to CR closure in obsidian etching and dawn image; cost legible in "hollow space inside every future connection," reweighting premise without causal breaks; oriented early via drowned valley and prototype.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy via prototype (heat as chord, russet drip) constrains choices like pressing ear to forge; trees' roots through portholes charge final image, mirroring internal fracture without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (imprint trust break) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via feeding absence to forge, forcing agency in ear-pressing with cost of self-complicity; keeper's advice tightens pressure coherently under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of absences as cavities emerges from particulars like preserved gap and cambium cells, resonant CR in forgiveness as "pale gold" reweighting without moralizing; brother's laugh echo ties arc organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited POV with perceptual signature (colors as sounds, cello embers); keeper's dialogue natural/subtextual, advancing via "feed the forge what you miss most"; rhythm modulates with aurora flares.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "glass cracking under weight of snow") taught early as mode, propelling via varied rhythm; minor metaphor density in peak forge beat slightly risks coherence but supports lyric propulsion without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, memory-eating trees, and absence-collection transforms betrayal trope; risk-taking in surreal orchard logic inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via root-fed stories without gimmickry.</comment>
