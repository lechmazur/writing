<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's trait of hearing unspoken words in chess pieces drives her orchestration of rebellion, embodied concretely early; confessions at gathering reveal character-particular flaws under pressure. Final pressing of sapling into grotto earns change with foreclosed path of fixed games. Minor slip: secondary characters' confessions feel archetypal without deeper contradiction in pivotal sharing circle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from diorama discovery to window displays to communal confessions, culminating in CR closure: "real and false roots entwined with a soft metallic sigh," reweighting fixed games with conceptual cost of amplified quiet. Mosaic shards pattern-taught early via hush imagery; orientation anchored by ~50 words. One tightening via grotto guiding communal stake suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobalt library and magnetic grotto constrain choices (grotto tugs compass to windows/hearts) and charge final image of entwined roots. Sensory hush/mist integrates via goal-directed action; POV bias filters chess/library as prophetic space. Spatial choreography clear across town shards without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tired of fixed games, plant second thoughts) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via windows to confessions tightening communal pressure; agency in displays/sapling press forecloses obedience path. Cost legible in exposure during "amplified quiet" and town waking to questions. Minor: no live option explicitly traded in peak sharing, but density reweights effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken gambit ("losing is the only way the game learns") emerges organically from confessions/images, resonant CR in final "pawn imagined soil... quiet louder than shouting" reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext layers via sapling/grotto motif constraining choices; ambiguity lingers in humble rebellion's reach.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV stable with perceptual signature in chess-piece whispers and hush-sensing; voice rhythmic/modulates from deliberate coaching to charged poise. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("I knew you’d hear it"), advances stakes. Minor register elevation in metaphors occasionally strains POV lexicon at peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but figurative overwriting pervades gathering climax ("voices layered, the magnetic grotto brightened; iron leaves lifted") triggering -0.7 coherence penalty for mixed metallic/tree vehicles without pattern payoff. Minor paraphrase loops in "hush" repetitions; rhythm propels overall. No scaffold obscures closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess rebellion via sapling/grotto transforms tropes into inevitable "forests of second thoughts"; risk-taking in mosaic quiet escalates stakes to conceptual root-taking without gimmickry. Final image recharges premise organically, no derivative echoes.</comment>
