<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wrapping badge around keystone as "partial solutions" from failing exams reveals values hierarchy, earned by mist confession and visions; contradictory impulses (carry/leave/partial) act in scene with exile cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: visions and badge act accumulate to charged poise on snow island; cost legible in "without credentials... invisible to drones," reconfiguring options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Keystone's "brilliant dimness" and mist "smelled of lilacs and printer toner" constrain mist walking and charge final seed image; sensory hierarchy POV-biased to unmeasured anomalies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visions deepen stake from quota to "sacredness hides in folds," forcing badge trade-off under accumulative lens; agency in partial dulling forecloses guild path with stranding cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Paper boat release non-literally answers automation vs. sacred, reweighting visions' lovers/children without moral; resonance from particulars like unbarcoded snow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (barcoded snowflakes, "metric of patience") biases to unmeasured; rhythm modulates from sinking footfalls to "darkness felt exactly bright enough."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density in "each flake unbarcoded now"; varied rhythm propels from cantrip exhale to boat vanishing, no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Partial solutions taught by failing every exam" ingeniously transforms underachiever trope; risks quiet CR in dim seed, synthesizing automated magic organically.</comment>
