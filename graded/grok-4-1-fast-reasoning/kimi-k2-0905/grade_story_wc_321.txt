<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arden's resilient positivity is embodied in grin amid tilting world and climactic laugh ricocheting as choir of refusal, earning final flip with contradictory refusal-to-surrender driving higher-stakes merge choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via radio warning therefore maneuvers therefore second flip yielding DC closure; cost legible in "one timeline must be poured into the other, and the pourer must choose which," with hourglass burning as felt price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Spectral grotto constrains via closing stalactites and barnacle patterns dictating steers; charges final image as roof parts then vanishes, leaving open water.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to merge timelines escalates causally from flickering hull to hot hourglass and closing grotto, Arden's agency in radio/steering narrowing options with legible trade-off cost at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade><comment>Theme of resilient endurance amid transience emerges via sideways motifs reweighted in final coherent tomorrow; resonant non-literal answer in pocketed brass caps carrying "weight of saved possibilities."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in sideways metaphors and rhythmic lyricism modulating to compressed urgency at "ferry shuddered"; no head-hopping, diction biased to ferryman's tactile optimism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative (e.g., "moon dripped like melting silver") but minor overwriting in climax metaphors slightly dulls propulsion; no loops, strong rhythmic variety accelerates to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of parallel timelines via ferry/hourglass transforms trope organically; risk-taking in poetic causality (barnacle coordinates) heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via established patterns.</comment>
