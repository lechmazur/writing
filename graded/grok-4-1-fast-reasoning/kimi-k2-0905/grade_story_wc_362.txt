<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation roots deeply in sister's death, intensifying through embodied lies like "I have let you go" that warm the prism, compelling the admission "I need you still" with fracture cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene via truthful lies rejecting untruth. Final renunciation earned by prior micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual actions build hush density to crack, yielding Charged Poise closure where fracture knits "not healed, but repositioned" with legible emotional cost in left prism. Orientation anchored early at arbor/car. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quartz arbor/mist constrains via singing branches and tightening veil, charging final chime as Elian departs. Frost patterns on car window filter POV-biased perceptions, mirroring internal states through refractions. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under ritual urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to commune/prove emotional absorption tightens via deepening hush and prism flare, narrowing denial options into endurance with fracture cost. Agency in lies and prism placement forecloses path. Lens escalation via density reweights to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of emotions absorbed/released emerges implicitly through prism colors and frost initials melting. Final "Keep the colors; I’ll keep the hush" reweights premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity without moral. Resonance from particulars like car shiver.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in refractions/patterns; diction/rhythm modulates from hush depth to cracking return. Prose texture distinct, lyric compression taught early via mist/footsteps, legible at closure. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors cohere (grief poured like light into prism), no loops/artifacts in peak hush beat. Rhythm varies for ear, syntax emphasizes like "frost began to retreat, lines evaporating." Zero scaffold in closure image.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystic ritual with object-emotion proof via frost braille and prism lies transforms grief trope organically. Risky accumulative lyricism heightens stakes in hush pulse without gimmick. Final path reveal inevitable from arbor particulars.</comment>
