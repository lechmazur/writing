<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (catalogue indexing her) act in scene via hypotheses and micro-choices like extinguishing lantern; final renunciation of false taxonomy earned by escalating discoveries with personal cost of "private pressure."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure ("the honest origin... erasure itself"); cost legible in "dappled resolve" and new ledger column reconfiguring history; orientation anchored early, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Flooded atrium with rising water and bronze drawers constrains choices (work by touch, stamp on surface); charges final surfacing image; selective sensory details (dripping chandeliers) mirror internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honest origins) signaled early, tightens via density/pattern break (phosphorescent glyph); agency in hypotheses/endurance forecloses erasure path with felt cost in rewritten ledger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of suppressed origins emerges implicitly from bruised cards/glyph; final image (warm wrist mark) offers resonant CR reweighting history's premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with indexer's perceptual signature (hypotheses as "alternative"); rhythmic control modulates intensity, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., "hours dripped past"); purposeful figuratives like "kelp forests" without muddle or loops; no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sunken archive erasing dry past via inverted stamp-map; risky accumulative lyricism heightens conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
