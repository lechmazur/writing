<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with motivation intensifying through micro-choices like pressing the lattice to stones and reading manuscripts aloud; contradictory impulses in chasing dissolving hush emerge in embodied suspension; final internalization of hush as heartbeat earns change with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds motifs to Conceptual Repricing closure where Cassian fits lattice to lens, reweighting lies into staircase with undeniable inheritance cost; orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene progression tightens without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (salt-bitten hinges, lantern oil and gull blood) filters through Cassian's priorities, constraining choices via impossibilities like hovering floors; jagged reef and Fresnel lens charge final beam image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to thread labyrinth signals early and deepens texturally through motif accumulation to wolf revelation; timeframe pressure forces stance crystallization before bodies found; agency in fitting lattice forecloses false echoes with felt inheritance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of withheld truth becoming wolf emerges organically from lattice confessions and revolving lens beam, reweighting parable without moralizing; final "wolf is me, and I am not early, I am exact" offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (hush as silver minnow); rhythmic syntax modulates intensity; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual, father's "voice rusted shut" revealing decay.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (hush, copperlight) propels via varied rhythm; figurative density peaks coherently in lantern room without muddle, though minor overload in "copper blades that sliced the dark into slow-motion fins"; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms cry-wolf fable into impossible lighthouse inheritance, with lattice threading lies risking poetic opacity but heightening stakes through irreplaceable conceptual wolf image.</comment>
