<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied motivation peaks sharply in "discover meaning in the mess, or at least manufacture enough," driving micro-choices like climbing and inputting frequency; interior conflict subtle but present in awkward confidence evolving to "welded to bone." Minor unearned feel in pulse-words "Remember, Reclaim, Reignite" but anchored physically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with vibration density building to Charged Poise closure in "shuttle rose, trailing song instead of fire," reweighting lull with undeniable promise/cost of departure; orientation anchored in first paragraph, one continuous scene perfect for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bare soles and ferrocrete/crane constrain tactile choices like feeling hum/climbing; recurring opera glasses charge final talisman image; selective sensory hierarchy (taste dust, hum through arches) mirrors POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reignite skies amid lull) signaled early, escalates via accumulative hum/song density forcing agency in crane balance/sing-back/ignition; cost legible in "not abandonment, but a promise" foreclosing grounded stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of lull-as-breath emerges organically from swallows/shuttle/stones humming into cosmic background; final "urging all grounded hearts to reignite" offers resonant CR without moralizing, though pulses verge on direct.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("soles tasting the dust," "peppercorns flung into blue soup") biases toward dreamer's synesthesia; stable close-third POV with rhythmic modulation under stress, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels but figurative overload in peak climb/launch ("tuning fork... wind instrument," "plasma flowers") borders coherence slip per overwriting check, dulling propulsion slightly; no loops, varied rhythm passes ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystic stone sci-fi with barefoot agency transforming rebellion lull via harmonic flight; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically, no template echoes.</comment>
