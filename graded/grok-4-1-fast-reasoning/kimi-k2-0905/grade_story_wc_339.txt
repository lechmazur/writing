<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to equation-ize release roots in family history (1914 recognition), with trembling hand embodying conflict; release earned via Elias's whisper and on-page writing. Minor abstraction in emotions ("precisely moment when mass stops") slightly dilutes embodiment under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ritual noting to CR closure (tips globe, plane settles, surfaces lighter) with conceptual cost of narrative physics realized in "equation, once balanced, leaves the solver... lighter." Orientation anchored early (rusty bulkhead, Erebus library); one tightening via buried 1914 number pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken library constrains via depth (200 feet Pacific, pressure gauges chime), charges closure (dissolving books, plane settles on floor). Sensory vivid/selective (barnacle-crusted threshold, bubbling voice); choreography clear (lectern, flooded shelf).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (physics of letting go) signaled early, textural escalation via refusal-to-balance variables, Elias whisper, 1914 recognition narrowing to release; agency in tipping globe forecloses attachment with felt lightness cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of narrative physics emerges via particulars (globe's Electra dips like final photo); final image ("plane tumbled out... becoming artifact") non-literally reweights release without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (physics metaphors: "mass times acceleration equals story over time"); rhythmic control modulates (short peak exhale vs. flowing descriptions); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You’re late").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines like "snow flakes... unread telegrams"); rhythm varies, no loops. Dense figuratives throughout lyric mode taught early, coherent to closure, but minor muddle in "spectral ionosphere" slightly drifts register.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Earhart wreck snow globe in sunken library with Death transforms letting-go trope; risk in lyric CR ("some stories... by reader’s absence") heightens stakes organically.</comment>
