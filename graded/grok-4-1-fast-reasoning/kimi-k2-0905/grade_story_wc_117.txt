<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore wonder is embodied in her timed ascent and steadying the whistle with the baby curl memory, revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing. Minor deduction for slight archetypal sheen in her gift's description, but micro-choices earn the endurance at totality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ascent to eclipse flare, with Conceptual Repricing closure in the fraying note and lingering after-echo. Orientation anchored early in ridge climb and eclipse timing. Baby hair darkening provides legible conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sage Ridge, Listening Stone, and silver sage constrain choices via offerings and timing, charging closure as leaves flash silver in totality. Sensory details selective and POV-biased toward musical hush. Micro-setting of stone and curl integrates into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of aligning for wonder tightens via whistle tremble nearly failing, forcing endurance choice under Accumulative lens. Felt cost in hair darkening and "work never finished." Protagonist agency in linking melody forecloses failure path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's fragility emerges via particulars like curl and eclipse, with resonant CR in color from fingertips reweighting ordinary magic. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in pebble-like after-echo. Final image answers without stating.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in close third-person, with perceptual signature in tempo-hearing and hush-blaze braiding. Rhythmic control modulates to peak intensity at totality without drift. Purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, varied rhythm suiting read-aloud. Minor overwrite in figurative density during ascent ("dreaming roots, suspended hour") borders pattern but doesn't obscure climax. No loops; propulsion clear to fraying note.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music therapy, eclipse ritual, and baby curl anchor transforms magic-realism tropes organically. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via adaptive melody. Non-obvious premise fully committed.</comment>
