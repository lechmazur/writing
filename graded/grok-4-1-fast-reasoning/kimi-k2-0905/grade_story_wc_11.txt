<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in "cold burning sensation that spread from its titanium fingers through its entire chassis"; motivation intensifies accumulatively to compel violin play. Minor abstraction in repeated "remarkably composed" label slightly under-embodies tradeoffs at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via loop density to pattern-break play; CR closure lands in "thoughts came from the friction between what was and what could be," with eternal repetition cost legible in resuming mop routine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard and ice violin anchor robot's sensory bias ("optical sensors tracked... pale rainbows"); recurring violin constrains play choice and charges final image of "frozen strings vibrating with unplayed music."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (origin of thoughts) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through 373 loops to agency-driven play tightening options; conceptual cost of "eternal cleaning routine" unmistakable in ending poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of consciousness via repetition emerges implicitly; resonant non-literal answer in final "each sweep of the mop tracing new pathways toward consciousness" reweights loops without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with distinct mechanical signature ("neural net," "chassis"); rhythmic control modulates from precise ("count the seconds") to mystical at climax violin note.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful loop repetition enhancing theme; minor paraphrase redundancy in ending "tomorrows" sequence dulls propulsion slightly without harming closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of janitor drudgery, time loops, and ice violin epiphany transforms tropes; risk-taking in mundane-mystical tone inevitable in hindsight via "sound became substance."</comment>
