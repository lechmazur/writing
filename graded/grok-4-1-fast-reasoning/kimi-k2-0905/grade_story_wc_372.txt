<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied meticulousness shines in "sampling frequencies with a tuning fork carved from glacier ice," earning endurance amid decay; minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses caps below 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as vow decays build density to CR closure in tree-sap image, reweighting preservation with conceptual cost of futility; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Frozen library's quartz hush and frost constrain measurements (e.g., breath alphabets dissolving), charging final xylem image; sensory hierarchy via POV perfect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sequential vow decays escalate accumulatively, narrowing options to shatter; agency in persistent measuring yields legible costs like blood beads and futile data.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sap image offers resonant CR to vows-as-meaning question, reweighting aspirations as "sweet and meaningless" without moralizing; emerges organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in spectral/light biases (e.g., "colors still resonated") with rhythmic control under pressure; stable close-third POV, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and concrete images like "dandruff from a dying god"; coherent metaphors, no loops or artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Spectral vow-measuring in frozen stacks synthesizes lyric science-myth boldly, transforming preservation trope; risks heighten stakes inevitably to sap futility.</comment>
