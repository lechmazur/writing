<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied contradictions like "chalk dust on her tongue—present but unformed," driving micro-choices such as sweeping the spiral into a straight path that refuses eternity, earning the final renunciation of fixed meaning with visible cost in embracing erasure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to mandala's exhale and tile flake's coherent whisper ("The mess is the only place unfinished enough to welcome you"), delivering on-page CR closure; cost legible in scattering hush and crumbling flake, reweighting impermanence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-settings like damp stone, ground quartz, and sand mandala constrain choices (raking spirals, sprinkling flake dust) and charge final image of flung sand; sensory hierarchy (lilac unease on skin) reflects Mira's perceptual bias without static catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering meaning tightens via mandala question ("Why do you draw what refuses to stay?") and her refusal gesture, deepening to acceptance with pulse as intrusion; cost unmistakable in heartbeat intrusion and flung mandala foreclosing permanence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of meaning as "motion to repeat" emerges organically from particulars like erased plaza and flung mandala, resonant CR in final plaza drawing that "would vanish under shoes and rain" reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic noticing ("lilac unease... cool and trembling" on skin); rhythmic control modulates with hush thickening, stable close third-person with no leakage, compression purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "mist folded inward until she stood inside a pearl") taught early, no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion clear to closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of whimsical fantasy (unlearning mist, hush congregation) transformed through Mira's chalk/sand impermanence arc; risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via tile flake's payoff.</comment>
