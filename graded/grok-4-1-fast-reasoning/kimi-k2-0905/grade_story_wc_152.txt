<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Embroiderer's motivation rooted in listening and disguised wisdom compels high-stakes embroidery and reveal; contradictory impulses peak in quavering voice masking precise action during council intrusion. Final renunciation of overt power via lullaby earns closure with relational cost on plotters. No unearned epiphanies; traits shown through micro-choices like reversed syllables.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of stitching patterns and silences builds to RR closure via embroidery ignition, reconfiguring conspiracy with felt cost in lieutenant's trembling hand. Orientation anchored early in observatory pre-dawn; single scene tightens meaningfully at projector reveal. No lens ambiguity or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt silk, stained-glass, eternal candle constrain choices—flame ignites hidden layer, charging final image of rearranged constellations as supply lines. Sensory details (wind rattle, thread crackle) filtered through embroiderer's priorities evolve with action. Micro-setting of alcove and dome guides reveal without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thwart coup via map) signaled early, escalates accumulatively to reveal tightening options; agency in spreading cloth and lullaby forces plotters' stance crystallization. Cost legible in pistol draw and lowered weapon, charging poise. Moral calculus between foolishness and truth sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden stories/listening emerges organically from stitching and silences, resonant CR in final dawn without gunfire reweighting conspiracy premise without moralizing. Adjacent possibilities shift from technique to viable futures, inviting ambiguity on republic's survival. No tidy binaries; complexity in plotters' change.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with poetic perceptual signature (star-threads, unheard stories); rhythm modulates from quiet stitching to charged reveal. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in senile request, pursuing goal. No head-hopping; compression taught early via dual embroidery layers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer image/action (e.g., "flame...ignited the hidden layer"); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language coherent/patterned in lyric mode, no muddle in peak reveal. Opening anchors stakes; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroidery as spy-map transforms tropes; risk in dual-layer reveal and reversed lullaby heightens stakes organically. Premise (foolish embroiderer thwarts coup) inevitable from particulars, no derivatives. Bold voice commits to poetic sci-fi without gimmickry.</comment>
