<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's "carefully resourceful" trait compels micro-choices like tearing the "Solanum for Silence" page into a compass and lending a year from her death; internal motivation intensifies via sharpened resolve at the brass plate. Time traveler applies secondary pressure without diluting her arc. Minor slip: contradictory impulses more implied than simultaneous in peak cipher beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: diary's pollen compass to verbena seeds to hybrid bud form density linkages narrowing access to unlearned lessons. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on releasing absences for second thoughts, with legible cost in "remove one year from her death." Orientation anchored early via obsidian shelf and bookstore.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Labyrinthine corridors and root-walls constrain descent/ascent choices; "unheard symphony" tastes and hums filter Elara's linguistic perception, charging final cello chord in dreams. Recurring diary as micro-setting evolves, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to steal unlearned lessons tightens via cipher forcing lifespan trade-off; agency in proposing renegotiation and pronouncing word narrows options under textural escalation. Cost unmistakable in year lent, reweighting traveler's lifeline and her fate at root-walls.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of planting unlearned lessons emerges via ink-flowers, released absences, and ongoing rescues; final image of diary pointing to tomorrow's gap offers non-literal answer to prevention without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like cello resolving mercy reweights ignorance premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in botanical-linguistic noticing ("synonyms for regret"); voice rhythm modulates from faint chords to crescendo. Sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven: "I can cut the sentence" advances causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density in lines like "crushed its illustration, and let the seeds fall through the comma"; varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting in metaphor density during descent, but pattern-taught and coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of linguistic ciphers, botanical seeds, and mistake-libraries transforms tropes; "absences folded into diary" for replanting feels inevitable. Bold risk in mounting unheard symphony charges closure without gimmickry.</comment>
