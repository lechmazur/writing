<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation rooted in palimpsest promise compels micro-choices like threading needle with memories, earning his transformation; interiority concrete via tingling seat and pulsing sphere. Girl as promise embodiment applies pressure through instructions. Lacks overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, tilting to conceptual over embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery density builds from fog/river to distilled sphere, tightening at "rain gutters stopped ticking" when sandbar rises. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with cost (coach dissolved, lifetime sphere under tongue). Orientation anchored immediately at crossing; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fog-bound river, ticking gutters constrain choices, mirroring internal distillation; sandbar/meadow evolution charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (ticking, mist, spindrift) selective via coachman's bias. Micro-setting (yarn needle, seat) tethers abstraction to tactile world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cross/distill before ticking stops) signaled early, escalates via unspooling yarn and needle twist narrowing to essence. Agency in piercing fog with story-thread; cost legible in coach's groan and erased crossings. Coheres under Accumulative lens with cadence shift at silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of distilling stories emerges via thread-sphere without statement, reweighting promise as ferry in final syllable of "salt and stone." Resonant image (droplet pulsing) answers complexity-to-essence non-literally. Ambiguity lingers in girl's dissolution without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person voice stable, perceptual signature biased to coachman's ambient awareness (e.g., "steam rises through ambient awareness"); rhythm modulates from ticking metronome to silence. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Thread it"). No head-hopping; compression purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short punchy steps amid long poetic swells), high density without loops; metaphors coherent (palimpsest, percolation) build pattern, not muddle climax. Propulsion peaks at "needle twisted once" forming sphere. Minor density in opening fog images purposeful for lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore (ferryman myth) with lyric distillation transforms tropes via yarn-sphere and palimpsest seat. Risky poetic compression inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmick; final hillcrest path feels non-obvious yet organic.</comment>
