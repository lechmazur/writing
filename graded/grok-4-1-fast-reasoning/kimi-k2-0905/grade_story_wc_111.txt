<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices like polishing marbles reveal contradictory impulses (mastery vs. servitude), earning the final realization; reflective blocks anchor to present rituals without flattening pressure. Minor diagnostic phrasing in epiphany ("truth was more beautiful") edges below 9+ without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from ritual to apple grove revelation to glove; CR closure reweights deception with conceptual cost legible in final farewell image. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden maze constrains via shifting paths and supplies impossible apple/glove, charging final image; sensory details (rustling leaves, dew cloth) filtered through Elara's priorities, mirroring internal states organically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (low luck vs. garden's knowing response) signaled early, deepens via successive gifts (apple, glove) forcing realization under Accumulative lens; agency in rituals forecloses control illusion with felt conceptual cost, but lacks sharp trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mended deception/partnership emerges from marble memories and garden responses, culminating in non-literal CR ("dancing together"); resonant image of marbles in glove reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (vegetative will, rustling language); rhythmic prose modulates lyrically under ritual pressure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm; minor paraphrase loops in marble descriptions (cracks/victories) but pattern-taught and tied to closure; no artifacts dulling final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of measurable luck vs. sentient garden, transformed via cracked marbles as victory maps; risk-taking in personified maze heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
