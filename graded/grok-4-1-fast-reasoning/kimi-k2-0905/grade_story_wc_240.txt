<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's spatial gift and grief-driven motivation compel nexus choice with embodied contradiction; headset data forces renunciation of "original" Luc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via laser folds to CR closure at nexus merger, cost legible in "unreadable fusion of fear and peace"; single scene causality holds tightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent caps and permeable stipes constrain pathing and charge nexus flare; spatial choreography coherent despite folds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to reclaim Luc tightens at dual signatures, agency in chaining dots forecloses swap with fusion's ambiguous cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image reweights replica premise via merged man and dispersed grief, emergent without statement; ambiguity lingers potently.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Spatial perceptual signature ("nested topographies") distinct and stable; rhythmic modulation peaks at "Let go" with compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density integrates senses into action; "quiet wildfire" motif propels without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fungal topology + grief exits synthesize boldly, premise risks realized in CR without retreat.</comment>
