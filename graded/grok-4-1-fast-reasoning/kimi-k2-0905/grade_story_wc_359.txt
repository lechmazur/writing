<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's synesthetic interiority and micro-choices (discarding sour fear, kneeling to slab) reveal contradictory impulses under pressure; swallowing the sheet earns his change as living document with internalized cost. Mentor reference anchors motivation without dominating.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density building to CR closure: swallowing reconfigures Elian as perpetual astonishment, with conceptual cost (defying Council via embodiment) legible in "tuning his pulse." Orientation anchored early; no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice cavern and aurora colors constrain choices (strip scales, braid rope to shift slab) and charge final exhale; synesthetic body-as-setting filters details purposefully, mirroring internal states without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certify wonder) tightens accumulatively through Vein/slab/hush, narrowing to ingestion agency; Council off-page slightly abstracts external pressure, but felt cost in stripped heart and internalized sheet charges image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Wonder-as-infrastructure emerges organically from mentor whisper, aurora braiding, and swallowing; final "eyes blazing with refracted music" offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing, reweighting premise via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("violet ripples," "crimson" song) biases noticing distinctly; stable limited POV with rhythmic modulation under rising density, no elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in synesthetic figures coherent under taught pattern (colors-to-notes); varied rhythm propels without loops, though peak fig density borders overwrite in hush sphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic prism-song and sculpted hush synthesize fresh fantasy infrastructure angle; swallowing as living document risks bold conceptual payoff, transforming quest trope organically.</comment>
