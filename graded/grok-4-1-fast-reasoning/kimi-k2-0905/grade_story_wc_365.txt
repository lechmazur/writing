<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and sensory-particular, with embodied contradiction in reaching for younger self only to be redirected; final renunciation of prior mapping earned via accumulated filaments in nerves. Minor abstract phrasing like "weight of a withheld truth" borders stock but anchors craft consistently.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of shards builds to CR closure in "loom collapse into a single thread: the decision to chart... consequences," with legible conceptual cost of complicity. Persistent shard constraint shapes every tactic; mosaic pattern taught by first threshold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shard as micro-setting constrains choices (pressed to deck opens loom, to forehead collapses it) and charges final image ("pockets the green glass shard"); sensory details like "lilac rain" selectively bias via POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping withheld truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via shard flares redirecting to revelation bay; agency in swallowing cube forces deepening knowledge, unmistakable cost in tasted "density" of complicity charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth's mass emerges organically from sensory particulars; final image of "engines roar anew... in the copper wire of her veins" offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing, reweighting maps from places to consequences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature of vibration/light idiom (e.g., "shard sings louder, vibrating... trapped cicada"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in zero-g pulse beat, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm supports propulsion, but figurative layering (weaving/loom/thread motifs) borders dense in revelation beat without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; minor repetition of "redirect" purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory cartography and multiverse shards yields inevitable complicity twist grown from shard logic; risk-taking in lyric mosaic heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
