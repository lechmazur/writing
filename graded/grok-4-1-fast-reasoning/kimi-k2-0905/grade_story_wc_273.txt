<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in "serene anger" embodied through narrowed pink eyes and racing heart; final acceptance earned by causal trail of losses. Micro-choices like deploying drone reveal values hierarchy with visible cost in vanishing. Single-POV voice coherent and particular, flaws (blind pursuit) compound before resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: bootprint → ink/drone → journal → portal → entry as DC/CR with legible cost in "disappeared through ephemeral patterns." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent, no shards. Closure reconfigures loss into pioneering with undeniable opportunity cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sandstone constrains ink evaporation via drone wind; post-eclipse warmth and UV light charge journal reveal and portal image. Sensory hierarchy (wind patterns, fractal spirals) reflects tracker bias, mirrors internal states without overt symbols. Spatial choreography clear in maze corridors to well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find Lyra, decode time) signaled early, tightens via drone recoil and independent shadow into portal threat. Kael's agency in emptying vial forecloses return with felt cost; causal escalation narrows to acceptance trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of time as elastic gift emerges organically from journal, portal vision, and final heartbeat image reweighting premise. Resonant non-literal answer in "live a thousand years in a single heartbeat," but Lyra's echoed thesis borders explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in fractal/ink noticing; rhythmic syntax modulates from serene to stretched intensity. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "ink spread into fractal spirals" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm accelerates to portal dive. Motif repetition (serene anger, ephemeral patterns) purposeful, no loops; minor figurative density in peak but coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractal ink portals, temporal origami, and wild AI drone transforms desert trope into inevitable CR. Risky lyric closure heightens stakes via conscious vanishing; no derivative echoes, fully committed premise.</comment>
