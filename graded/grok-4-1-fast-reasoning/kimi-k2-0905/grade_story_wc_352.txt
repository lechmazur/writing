<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prism-minded trait yields concrete micro-choices like spectral band navigation, earning the kernel passage and final success with doodle cost; embodied stress (tug behind eyes, doodle twitch) roots motivation without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of inversion patterns builds to Charged Poise closure (light surges, escape leap) with time cost legible; orientation anchors early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Quartz veins, upward droplets, threshold patches constrain choices (indigo slide, final sprint); recurring mist/ferns charge final image, sensory hierarchy prism-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue combinations) tightens via kernel stirring and inversion wane under Accumulative lens, forcing whisper modulation and doodle void-fit; agency in color tricks yields sprint cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cycle of hiding/finding reweighted by final smile ("combinations would still remember how to hide"); emergent from particulars like chant-lull and quartz sigh, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (fractured vision, iron-childhood whisper); rhythmic diction modulates intensity, elisions (doodle reactions) taught early and pay off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels (droplet lanterns guide; ink bleeds script); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle in peak inversion-wane sprint.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Gravity inversion + spectral memory-reentry transforms quest trope into fresh synthesis; risk of lyric physics (threshold jitters) heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight doodle-void fit.</comment>
