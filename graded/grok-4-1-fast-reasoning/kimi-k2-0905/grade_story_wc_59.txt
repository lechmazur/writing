<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prince's motivation rooted in raw loss ("skin beneath his broken crown") compels assembly choices with embodied regret (apology to raven), earning final smile; contradictory impulses in grave-robbing show in trembling fingers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from hypothesizing to egg-crack release; CR closure legible in "flawed genesis is still genesis" with conceptual cost of palace descent reweighting mechanical world.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Suspended palace constrains via swaying chains and ladders, mirroring internal state; charges final image as "chains snapping one by one" into plunge, with rust-weeping gears evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reawaken beauty tightens accumulatively through egg-warming and crack; agency in assembly forecloses mechanical stasis with cost in palace fall crystallized at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of creation-as-destruction-backwards emerges organically from ribbon unscrewing gears; final "fall itself might be the first spread of wings" reweights premise with resonant ambiguity, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature of hypothesizing (e.g., "mix the colors in the ratio of childhood summers"); rhythmic control modulates from reverie to climax intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but figurative overload in climax ("ribbon of colored wind... unscrewed their teeth") risks coherence without stricter economy, slightly dulling peak image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical decay and organic resurrection via moonlight distillation and pin-Morse sobbing transforms tropes; risk in poetic conceit heightens stakes inevitably to CR plunge.</comment>
