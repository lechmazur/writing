<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction peaks at the dais choice between descending (sealing fate) and ascending (erasing memory), earning the loop acceptance; interiority particular via feverish starlight in palms. Minor slip: disenchantment archetypal without deeper flaw complicating mid-climb tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising from climb's lacy air to grotto's paradox and CR closure (crowning erases memory, restores name via cracked mirrors). Orientation anchored early (queen climbs ridge post-warning). No slips; cost legible in "burn the last of her living memory."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens via POV (dew-soaked slippers, ice-threaded lungs constrain climb); recurring black glass/shard charges final image, mirroring dream loop. Basalt steps and pulsing stones guide choices tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel dreams/save memory) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via palm-pooled starlight revelation narrowing to dais trade-off; agency in stepping onto dais forecloses descent with felt erasure cost. Fireflies cadence-shift undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of loop-acceptance emerges organically from bleeding light motif shifting to crown, resonant CR in shared exhale reweighting prophecy as self-warning without moralizing. Firefly applause image lingers with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (lacy/bleeding diction biased to queen's dissolving memory) modulates rhythmically under stress; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in paradox-charged grotto.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "bleeding starlight pooled in her palms, warm as a child's fever" advances plot/embodiment); minor overwrite in stacked metaphors (lace/ice threads, frost flowers) during climb slightly dulls propulsion before closure clarity holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-loop prophecy via starlight-crown transforms time-travel trope; ridge-grotto's paradox inevitability grows from particulars, bold risk in CR closure heightens without gimmick.</comment>
