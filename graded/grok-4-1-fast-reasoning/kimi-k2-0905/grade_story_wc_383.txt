<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's skepticism contradicts her haunted obedience to the shell from the start, earning her final humming choice with embodied cost (vision loss). Interiority particularizes through resonant bone vibrations and fevered reflections. Minor epiphanic summary mid-story ("she admitted") slightly abstracts without fully dramatizing the pivot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: shell murmur density builds to garden response and pond replay, culminating in RR closure (memory freed at color cost) with legible before/after. Single scene causality tight via motivated steps (shell -> gate -> pond). Orientation anchored early in garden/character.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden details (indigo hedges, silver foxglove, wisteria gate) constrain path and charge climax (pond ledger, erupting flowers). Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's bias (mother's lullaby echoes). Evolves causally to mirror internal quarantine break, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim quarantined memory) signaled via shell; accumulative escalation peaks in humming trade-off (color for archive), agency-driven with visible cost charging final image. One tightening sufficient: garden activation narrows to payment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (isolation to shared memory freedom) emerges from particulars (shell circuit, garden ledger); final commuter humming reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost (contagion as anthem). No moralizing; ambiguity in skepticism's fall lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (frequencies, resonance vibrations); voice modulates rhythmically from twilight bruise to grayscale dawn. Lyric compression taught early, paid in closure image. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varying rhythm; purposeful metaphor pattern (bruise, funeral clothes, vinyl pond) coheres without muddle. Minor overwriting in opening hedge/petals density (-0.3); no loops, scaffold clean. Climax clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory quarantine sci-fi with lyric resonance (shell as key matching inner fracture); transforms skeptic trope via garden archive payoff. Bold risk in color-blind cost heightens stakes organically.</comment>
