<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied in tactile reading of wood grain and floorboards; motivation intensifies credibly from return to realization. Final change earned via prior cues like father's teaching, but borders unearned epiphany at "She understood now: the sacred feeling," diluting contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing closure; cost legible in "falling not down but through" reconfiguring home and loss. Orientation anchored early; reflective shards taught by logbook cue interleave without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drifting terrace and wood grain constrain choices (migration creaks, edge stepped from) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (winds in rings, bare feet reading). Details evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover thresholds) signaled early, tightens via notches discovery under Accum lens, forcing deepening realization with agency in analysis and step. Cost unmistakable in drifting away from known home, reweighting options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (growth rings, butterfly wake) to resonant CR ending reweighting "necessary distances" without moralizing. Final image answers sacred thresholds via intersection of stories, lingering ambiguity intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (storms in wood, air thick with memory); rhythmic diction modulates intensity purposefully. No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative overload ("pages soft as moth wings," "featherly determined") in most sentences of peak realization beat violates coherence without pattern payoff, dulling propulsion. Minor loops ("fractured hush" x2, drifting motif) obscure closure slightly; no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mazes-as-time/weather codes transforms tropes via wood-grain reading and drifting terrace; risk in lyric CR heightens stakes. Final reconfiguration inevitable from established butterfly effect particulars.</comment>
