<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of contradictory impulses: fear of forgetting clashes with resolve to memorialize, shown in threading the filament amid snaps and final step out. Interiority particular via synesthetic logs ("tastes like burnt coffee"). Earned closure choice forecloses survival path with felt cost of self-sacrifice. Backstory anchors tilt present actions cleanly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of snaps (03:17 to final pop) and releases build to Charged Poise CR in final image of floating amid kites, reweighting memory premise with conceptual cost of her fall preserved. Orientation anchors immediately (gondola, altitude). Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Telescope as recurring micro-setting constrains choices (unscrew, thread, speak into) and charges closure (flares then falls as proof). Sensory hierarchy vivid/POV-specific: "bruised nimbostratus pulsing with regret," zero-g dust galaxies. Details evolve causally with snaps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memorialize proof before fall) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via timed snaps narrowing options, forcing kite releases and step out. Agency in micro-choices (log, thread, release) pays visible cost: life traded for memory dispersal. Climax coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory in clouds/spaces emerges organically via logs/kites; final image (telescope falling as "brass telescope full of spooled wholeness") reweights premise non-literally, proving empty spaces remember with conceptual cost. No moralizing; ambiguity in child's misread lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic sky emotions ("propeller trying to remember its own name"). Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically with pressure, compression purposeful/legible. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm; figs coherent/patterned (emotional synesthesia taught early). Minor overwrite in peak snaps ("groaned, fraying wire by wire") but no muddle/loops touching closure. Read-aloud ear excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aviation/cloud science with memory-wire premise transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes. Telescope's final fall inevitable in hindsight, no derivatives.</comment>
