<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marrow's motivation to salvage rooted in ghost whispers intensifies through embodied risks like palms sticking to ice; interiority concrete via dream parsing and careful truth-weaving. Final endurance—carrying knowledge as second heart—earned with cost of passengers dissolving. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in-scene prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dream globe seeds pattern, shrine analysis deepens density, corridor discovery cadence-shifts to CR closure where intact globe reconfigures wreckage into light, cost legible in sealing windows and collapsing wreck. Orientation anchored early (diving S.S. Caldera). No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glacier constrains via groaning whale-ice, crevasse-blue tent, air-pocket jellyfish memories; recurring ice/shrine charges final mirror image. Sensory hierarchy (cold-burning candles, salt-forgiveness hymn) POV-filtered through diver's tactile ear. 9+ test: shrine crack forces corridor choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvage pure amid digestion) signaled by ghosts; accumulative escalation via cameo-tracing density to glacier dialogue/crack, narrowing to heart-dive with agency in following/swimming. Cost visible: towing globe as wreck collapses, foreclosing passenger ties. Tightening sufficient but lacks one agency-driven reversal for 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wreckage cradling light emerges via shifting snow globes (melted cameo-slag to intact shrine-self); final mirror reweights cameos as tapestry without moral state. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes. 9+ test: non-literal answer in future-teaching vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (dreams as leaky souls, ice as whale-digester); rhythmic modulation peaks in hymn-taste, prose-as-mind reflects whisperer's poetic caution. No elision withholding; experimental compression taught early pays in CR. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "glass warped into teardrops" advances object/theme); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops/artifacts. Minor figurative density in shrine beat (cold candles/windows) borders overwrite but pattern-taught, coherent. Closure image undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost-whisperer parses dream-cameos in glacial liner-wreck; risk in lyric accumulation heightens CR stakes via self-recursive globe. Transformation of tropes (snow globes as memory-leak) inevitable in hindsight; no derivatives.</comment>
