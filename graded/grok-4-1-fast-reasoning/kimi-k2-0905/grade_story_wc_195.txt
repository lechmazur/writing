<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Knight's motivation rooted in prior allegiance compels surrender at climax, with contradictory shame (blackened armor) and trembling fingers embodying internal conflict; final trade forecloses human path with felt cost. Minor abstraction in epiphany ("shape of possibility was never a single thing") edges from 9+ perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery density builds to CR closure ("he—now factually mystical artifact—was the crease"), with cost legible in "wooden hand, practiced the first step"; orientation anchored in first paragraph, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse details (upside-down trees, silver sap, clockwork seeds) constrain choreography ("step, pause, pirouette" opens curtains) and charge final image (sap sealing cracks); sensory hierarchy surreal yet POV-filtered through knight's shame/regret. No generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture possibility via allegiance) tightens via unsnap into exchange, narrowing options under accumulative lens; agency in surrender drives escalation, cost visible in "armor fell away in petals of rust" altering tactics permanently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of traded prisons/prisons ajar emerges organically from exchange, reweighted in CR realization without moralizing; final image ("universe lean closer") resonates non-literally, charging prior patterns with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature mystical (mercury skies, shivering bliss); purposeful compression taught early pays off at closure without head-hopping; puppet speech subtextual, advancing soul-trade.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but figurative density in climax ("gravitational tenderness," "coating... with factual mystical patience") borders overwriting without muddle; no loops, but minor scaffold in repetitive "shivering bliss" echoes dulls peak slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of knight/puppet inversion transforms tropes organically, with risk-taking in reality-shift frame heightening stakes; irreplaceable "factually mystical" crease realization feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
