<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scattered memories as moths and phosphor sting like joy embody contradiction; slamming mica into ribs at climax earns name recall and song alteration with embodied cost, compelling higher stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mica expansion to vine resistance, culminating in Conceptual Repricing where infinite orchards interconnect via invitation song; cost legible in "shards into her ribs" and scabbed night crust.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quicksilver dreams and grafted pomegranate constrain choices (roots in alembics, branch smears phosphor); final luminous greenhouse charges closure image, mirroring internal shift from scattered to knit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle via songs) tightens through faltering chorus and tarry vines forcing song pivot; agency in blood-mica lens reweights options with rib-pain cost under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mutual reflection emerges via silhouettes aligning lips, culminating in non-literal answer: "pain become portal" recharges prior isolation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (memories flutter like moths); rhythmic modulation peaks in "voice cracked yet stubborn," heightening pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (mica thinning to membrane); figurative consistency (woven threads, tarry vines) taught early avoids muddle, propels to phosphor-fused closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirror orchards and clockwork seeds transforms reflection tropes; bold lyric risk in infinite orchards payoff heightens stakes via invitation canon.</comment>
