<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses from past intervention ("tried to save a chronicle") act via learned restraint in present micro-choices like "witness only"; final becoming earned by causal buildup with embodied cost ("memories flatten"). Keeper reads as particular through ink-stained fingers and softening edges under silence's pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of folds/silence/swans builds to CR closure ("she was to become the next fold, the next swan") with legible conceptual cost in final image ("memories flatten, ink draining"). Orientation anchored early (keeper at obsidian refuge); single mystical scene coheres without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting (moss-laced shelves, mirror-water) constrains choices (path narrows, water bears weight without ripple) and charges closure image (library breathing around her). Sensory hierarchy (hush as cloak, damp creases) reflects POV urgency; evolves causally (shelves rising like trees).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witness without judgment) signaled early, tightens texturally via deepening realizations ("library itself was the obsidian refuge"); agency in stepping onto mirror forecloses path with cost (becoming silence). Escalation coheres under Accumulative lens without reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: witnessing reweights to "fold the world into a shape that holds no weight" via swan/book image shift, resonating without statement; final reconfiguration ("single black feather") answers central question non-literally with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in syntax/rhythm ("walls warping into shelves of moss-laced parchment"); single POV stable with perceptual bias (reality "grips loosely" via her senses). Compression taught early (swan folds) pays off legibly at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (pages "flutter like startled ravens"); figurative pattern (folding/paper) taught early without muddle, though dense metaphors border overwrite in buildup. No loops/scaffold; rhythm varies for propulsion, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic librarian-as-swan-cycle transforms tropes via regenerative silence rule-set; bold lyric accumulation risks high but coheres, with keeper's dissolution inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
