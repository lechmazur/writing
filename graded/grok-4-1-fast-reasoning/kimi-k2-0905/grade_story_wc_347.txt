<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (hatred of orchard vs. dutiful guidance) act simultaneously in micro-choices like pressing warmth-ghosts; final endurance earned with visible cost in "long walk back to the orchard that kept her prisoner." Flaws complicate without safety-hedging; embodiment specific (knees popping, tasting iron).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of impressions builds to Charged Poise closure where travelers escape but Mara's isolation crystallizes in final image ("pockets the empty shell halves... started the long walk back"); cost legible in "prisoner." Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cliffside micro-setting constrains choices (can't enter, palms press rim for impressions) and charges closure (frost seals handprints into "crystal fossils"); sensory hierarchy urgent (wind erases scent, gears "grinding teeth"). Details tactile/lived-in, evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide before frost) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening (arrow to handprint at "last fork"); agency in adaptive impressions forecloses paths with cost (time "thinned," her isolation). Pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of graceless beauty emerges organically from particulars (saving strangers she hates/never meets); final image reweights duty's cost without moral ("graceless beauty of saving strangers she would never meet again"). Ambiguity lingers in orchard's "lullaby of rot."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (blueprint "flares across her vision"); rhythmic control modulates urgency (short sentences in bird swoop: "Mara froze, breath held"); no head-hopping, voice concrete-poetic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; rhythm propels (frost "lace[ing] grass blades like tiny white nooses"); figures coherent/purposeful ("warmth bled down the cliff face like a candle left too close"), no overwriting in peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: nut-blueprint, warmth-ghosts, mechanical birds transform curse tropes; risk in indirect guidance heightens isolation stakes, inevitable in hindsight via orchard's "silent accusation."</comment>
