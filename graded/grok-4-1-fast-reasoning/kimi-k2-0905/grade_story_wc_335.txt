<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's contradictory impulses—nervous backwards walking versus defiant spitting—embody resilience under pressure, earning the mentorship choice; child intuitively mirrors without voice convergence flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising through shard images to Charged Poise closure in unbroken circle and freed shadow, reweighting exile premise with conceptual cost of shared memory legible in final exhale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurring shards and teacup constrain choices (catching glint, sealing clauses) and charge final image where shadow slips free; sensory hush and swing ghost mirror internal defiance without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exile vs. resilience tightens texturally at tea-leaf prediction of binding, forcing child-mentorship deepening; cost felt in Lira remembering for both, though child arrival borders convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically from backwards paths and rearranged leaves, culminating in non-literal circle unbroken that reweights defiance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (geometric readings, annotations) with rhythmic poetic diction modulates intensity; child's sparse dialogue carries subtext naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors (blade smile, warm honey), but figurative layering in opening risks minor coherence strain without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shard-archivist exile and tea geometry transforms library trope into inevitable loop-defiance; risk-taking in backwards choreography heightens stakes organically.</comment>
