<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's interiority shines in embodied details like "insomnia now a lantern," with micro-choices (setting mirror, sprinkling turmeric) revealing methodical hope under fatigue pressure. Final fatigue-to-blanket change earned via sustained painting. Minor slip: emotions poetic but occasionally abstract, lacking deeper contradiction in peak glyph-writing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from first stroke's "hiss of syllables" to air thickening, visions pouring, culminating in RR/Charged Poise as mural becomes neighborhood lung with felt cost (Mira's sleep, moon setting). Single scene coherent, orientation anchored in opening climb. Closure cost legible in "bristles dimmed, the last glyph drying."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse richly specific (peat/saffron air, bruised marigolds), constraining choices (north window mirror for moon) and charging closure (glass coated, becoming lung). Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (turmeric on canvases), evolves causally (orchids open). Micro-setting (brush) recharges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finish mural/coax lost language before dawn) signaled early, escalates texturally via density increase (glyphs to humming wind to indigo steam), narrowing to lung realization with agency (faster painting). One tightening sufficient; cost felt in Jules' arrival complicating solitude, Mira's yielding to sleep. No coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of enduring kindness emerges organically from mural visions ("coins warm from palms") and final marigolds in wipers, reweighting lost languages premise without statement. Resonant CR in commuters' smiles as "recalled from exile," inviting ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from proof-of-kindness question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (moonlight rinsing eyes, scents as emotions). Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically ("hiss of syllables curling into vines"), purposeful compression taught early. No dialogue issues; inference matches Mira's knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short hum beat vs. flowing visions), no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (greenhouse as throat/lung). Propulsion aligns with escalation, closure image sharp ("leaves of lost languages stuck to her shoes"). Minor figurative density in peak but pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: magical brush revives kindness via lungs/mural in smog city, transforming insomniac trope through textural accumulation. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes (abolished tongue's curve), inevitable in hindsight. Non-obvious angle on memory via pollen/seeds.</comment>
