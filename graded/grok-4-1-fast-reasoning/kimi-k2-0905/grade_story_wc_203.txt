<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions, as in "elevator cable ghosting through the shaft of her own life, fraying one strand at a time," earning the closure choice to ascend cracks and all; no unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from ghost arrival to ceiling crack discovery and time-loop CR; cost legible in leaving the barrel, foreclosing the fixer's loop without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration constrains choices, like warped linoleum pulse and dust avalanche enabling the climb; recurring dust patterns and rafters charge the final crack-in-self image without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve barrel vs. ghost invitation) deepens via child ghost's point to ceiling, forcing agency in climb and renunciation; cost unmistakably felt in "postponed the fall, never prevented it," reweighting under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of inescapable cracks emerges organically through fraying cables, time fissure, self-crack mirroring; resonant CR in final ascent reweights fixing vs. falling without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in technician's metaphors ("dust accumulation patterns like a detective reading Braille"); rhythmic modulation heightens ghostly density without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with purposeful figurative pattern (circus/elevator/time motifs); minor overwriting in peak climb beat ("snowfall of ticket stubs," "ladder of cold shimmer") risks coherence but does not dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator tech ghost-seer in circus time-loop transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight via mainspring-ceiling crack premise.</comment>
