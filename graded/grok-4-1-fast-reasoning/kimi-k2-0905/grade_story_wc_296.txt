<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (guarded yet pressing seed into wrist) act simultaneously in embodied pain and choice; final confession renunciation earned by causal buildup of circles and mirrored revelation, with binding cost visible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density increase in circling gyre to stillness and reversal; closure as Charged Poise reconfiguration lands on-page ("vortex began to turn again... rewinding the gyre") with conceptual cost of exposure and judgment legible in final outward carry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Swirling roots and mirrored water constrain choices (widening circles method) and charge final image (sealed silver eye, reversing orchard); sensory selection (creaking trunks, bobbing apples) reflects druid bias and urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hunt escaped confession) signaled early and deepens via circles to spoken truth; agency in seed-pressing and unbending forces trade-off (binding vines spare her but mark as trespasser), cost unmistakable in sprouting and reversal under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of confession as growth (not frozen) emerges organically from particulars; final image ("growing, ring by ring, into the timber of tomorrow’s storms") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting guarded secrecy with enduring exposure, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (nature-war metaphors like "war banner," "penitent soldier"); rhythmic control modulates from creaking tension to hushed stasis, purposeful compression legible under lyric Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied syntax mirroring gyre expansion/contraction; figurative layering purposeful without muddle in peak ("mirrored water accepted the confession"), though minor density heaviness in circling descriptions prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of druidic ritual as confessional gyre transforms tropes (cursed lake, flesh-plant) into inevitable warlike serenity; risk-taking in textured reversal heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
