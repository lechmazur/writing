<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's interior conflict shines in embodied reactions like vomiting the envelope and stomach lurching as pages erase, compelling higher-stakes micro-choices; final merger feels earned via prior causality without safety-hedging. Contradictory impulses act in scene (pursue vs. preserve past), satisfying 9+ test narrowly, but some epiphanies border on unearned revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds revelations from cameo spiral to merging with "The curator is the catalog," delivering CR closure with legible cost (erased pages return as footnotes). Nonlinear pattern taught early via inheritance concept; one tightening at fruit-plucking escalation suffices. No orientation debt; anchors clear by para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bathroom pod as micro-setting constrains (dampens telepathy, connects to xylem), charging final orchard image; astral orchard vividly selective (starlight petals chiming, galaxy-fruit). Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (existential steam, drain swirling lost birthdays). Environment shapes choices like racing back, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pursue forbidden knowledge vs. lose past) signaled early via envelope command; Accumulative escalation via density (breakthroughs, fruit cost) narrows options, with agency in inquiries. Fruit-plucking turn forces trade-off with visible price ("a page vanished from the book of her past"). Cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of inheritance as "simply complicated love arriving early" emerges organically from particulars like galaxy-fruit erasing past; final image ("authors herself") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise. Minor thematic echo in closing "gentle warning" line borders sermonizing, docking from 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct surreal perceptual signature (petals chiming like tuning forks, seeds humming lullabies) with rhythmic control under pressure; stable third-limited POV, no leakage. Prose texture modulates intensity (short sentences in race back). Satisfies 9+ test; elision purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (read-aloud flows), no loops or scaffolds; metaphors consistent in orchard pattern without muddle. Minor density slip in repetitive "first and last page" phrasing, but doesn't touch closure. Zero artifacts in peak merge beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nonlinear inheritance via pistachio cameo grafting memories transforms tropes organically; bold surreal risks (time origami, bathroom chrysalis) heighten stakes, inevitable in hindsight at "The curator is the catalog." No derivative echoes; risk elevates (+0.3).</comment>
