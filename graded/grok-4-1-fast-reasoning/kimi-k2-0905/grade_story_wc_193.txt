<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in mischievous grin amid haunting hums, compelling the bolt-twist choice at climax with embodied cost (blood drawn); final renunciation of shifts earned by scam-rooted traits. Single-POV coherence flawless, flaws (debt-haunt) complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Oriented instantly via Lira/porthole/farm; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as glitch-messages accumulate to root-cave circuit, CR closure via diamond-pitch reconfigures multiversal debt with legible cost (palm blood, tide calm). No orientation debt; constraint (bolt fissure) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent farm/root-cave constrains crawl/slot/twist choices, pressure doubles reality; sensory hierarchy (42Hz hum, copper spores) mirrors debt-stakes, charges final exhale/halo image. Micro-setting (bolt fissure) pivotal at climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt-transmutation) signaled early, escalates via agency (reply/crawl/slot/twist) under Accumulative lens with density spike to chorus/shear; cost unmistakable in bloodied diamond foreclosing debt-path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (debt as compressible matter/forgiveness currency) emerges organically via scam-farm fusion, reweighted in diamond-pitch/tide-calm final image without moralizing; resonant CR answers "promise=debt?" via multiversal reset.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (synesthetic glitches: "pixels sliding sideways like...seam") modulates rhythm to pressure (short spikes at twist/crack); glitch-texts subtextual, voice poetic yet legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "every unpaid installment compress inside the bolt"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (pressure->diamonds) without muddle in climax shear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis (scam hums + quantum fungi + parallel texts -> diamond) transforms tropes organically; risk in "concepts become physical" heightens stakes, inevitable diamond-pitch feels fresh.</comment>
