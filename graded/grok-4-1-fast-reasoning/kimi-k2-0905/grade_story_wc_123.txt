<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's meticulous traits drive micro-choices like waiting for the pigeon and calibrating to lichen's pulse, earning her final renunciation of falsified data with solitude's cost. Contradictory impulses—curiosity versus follower's threat—act simultaneously in her lateral descent. No safety-hedging; flaws in trust compound via the forged note in her handwriting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pigeon note to lichen map realization, culminating in Charged Poise CR where backward logs reconfigure quarantine truth with risk cost legible in "solitude complete yet populated." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via shaft descent narrows options purposefully. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Phosphorescent lichen maps constrain her calibration choice and charge closure image of underground stone mirroring internal integrity. Sensory details like "wet limestone and pigeon feathers" filter through meteorological POV, evolving causally with descent. Micro-setting (gargoyle panel, shaft crack) guides tactics without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—integrity versus falsified quarantine—tightens accumulatively via forgery realization and follower's intent, forcing agency in new log that forecloses sanctioned path with arrest risk. Cost felt in "every storm she had mapped would become a lie" and final solitude. One deepening suffices; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of uncontainable truth emerges organically from pigeon chain and backward logs, reweighted in final image of unrecorded rain as "silvered proof" without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like lichen's rogue grid; no tidy binary, ambiguity in "city’s screens overflowed."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with meteorological perceptual signature ("wind shear to the third decimal," "anemometer to the lichen’s faint pulse"). Rhythmic control modulates from hushed dusk to underground tranquility; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with lines like "integrity depends on solitude" advancing stakes and voice; varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language ("sky bruised into violet") coherent and sparse in peaks, propelling to closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Time-paradox forgery in her handwriting transforms quarantine trope into fresh conceptual engine; backward logs via trained pigeon synthesize meteorological solitude ingeniously. Risky underground chain heightens stakes coherently, inevitable in hindsight without derivatives.</comment>
