<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in dropping beads forward then collecting them back, with final renunciation of pursuit earned by hollow realization and dawn reflection; embodied emotion peaks in "palm against schist still warm" and charcoal on skin. Interiority concrete and glass-specific without stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via frost patterns, ledger flaking, and hollow schism to Charged Poise closure; crushing ledger and turning back reconfigures options with legible cost in foreclosed path. Orientation anchored early in canyon under stars with artist and ledger.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Canyon walls narrow choices and frost patterns guide tracking; obsidian shard and beads constrain tactics and charge final sparks image. Sensory hierarchy glass-POV filtered, vivid without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find purpose in pauses deepens texturally at hollow argument read in dust, forcing renunciation with visible cost in scattered ledger and reclaimed beads. Pressure coheres accumulatively without reversal mandate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of purpose in pauses emerges via shifting frost/ledger images to final "pontil rod, gathered a glowing orb" reweighting action-to-stillness without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in glass motifs ("pale enamel," "imperfect glazing") with rhythmic modulation under stress; stable single POV, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (resonance, drifting); no loops or scaffolds, propulsion peaks in "letters drifting off like moths" to final image. Minor overwriting in openings doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fugitive chase into reflective stasis via glass-ledger-frost; risk in lyric accumulation heightens thematic stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early patterns.</comment>
