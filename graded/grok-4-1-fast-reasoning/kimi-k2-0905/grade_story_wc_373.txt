<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's contradictory impulses—hoping father thwarts while proceeding—act simultaneously in the waiting beat, earning the fob surrender as a meaningful renunciation with embodied cost in the "half-moons" dug into skin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via tightening hush and tide rise to on-page Conceptual Repricing at fob drop ("small wet click"), reconfiguring trust with legible emotional cost in the final lightness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pier, tide, and phonograph horn constrain choices (recording proximity to chest) and charge closure image (cylinder labeled amid "broken things"); sensory selectivity mirrors internal fracture without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (record trust breaking) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through absent thwart and tide pressure, narrowing to agency in fob handover with visible cost (family oath broken, felt in "emptied" aftermath).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of corroding love emerges organically from fob trade and absent father, resonant in final image of "silence no one could sell back," reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "move like liquid night") biases noticing toward fracture sounds/images; rhythmic modulation peaks in terse closure drop, stable first-person distance under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and sensory propulsion; figurative density purposeful in accumulative wait but risks muddle in "pupils in the dark," not touching closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Phonograph recording feelings transforms pirate-moonshine tropes into fresh premise; fob drop's inevitability from hush truce risks heightening stakes organically.</comment>
