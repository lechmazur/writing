<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the seductive pull of the letter's beauty versus truth-rescue drive, earning the final shedding of family glory; embodied stress in heartbeat and memories anchors interiority without diagnostic excess.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as petal-ivy-rail patterns build to CR closure, with legible cost in "shedding of inherited false glory" reconfiguring stakes; orientation anchors early, no ellipsis breaks causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivy, semaphore, and rosebush constrain escape choices and charge final bare-bush image; sensory details (moonlight shadows, petal whisper) filter through historian's rational gaze, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant recapture stake tightens accumulatively via footsteps reversal narrowing escape options; agency in climb/leap forecloses confrontation path with felt legacy cost, though external pressure leans light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Noble lies theme emerges organically from letter's "arrogant gold," memory hymns, and final plain-paper vision reweighting myth; resonant CR answers without moralizing, complexity in near-understanding of deception.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in rational parallels and historian's knotwork notice; rhythmic diction modulates tension (short heartbeats amid lyrical decay), no leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "petals brushed her neck" times action/feels pressure); minor metaphor density in opening fits accumulative pattern without muddle, varied rhythm passes ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rosebush-petal clock and railway-history synthesis transforms artifact-heist trope into fresh CR on lies' rails; risk in quiet CR heightens thematic inevitability without gimmick.</comment>
