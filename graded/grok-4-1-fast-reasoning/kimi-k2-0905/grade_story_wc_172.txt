<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in the swallowing act, where amorality yields to sentiment with embodied cost (tears, sound nesting like cuckoo). Interiority concrete via chest-wings and calcified guilt. Final renunciation earned by prior drought-financing reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of cracks/note/sparks builds to CR closure where swallowing reconfigures preservation as internal echo with conceptual cost ("amorality is just another cage"). Orientation anchored in first line (salt flat, egg); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Salt crust constrains egg-pressing and map-tracing; thunder/humidity orchestrate precise conditions, charging final rain-erased footprints. Sensory hierarchy (crunch, dust-smell, iron-feathers taste) filters through sentimental guilt. Final ripples mirror internal struggle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve echo) deepens via note's rise and sparks' watershed projection, forcing swallowing under accumulative lens. Agency in waiting/kneeling/tracing forecloses external preservation with felt internal cost. Escalation narrows to echo's internalization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of echo over preservation emerges via egg-to-voice progression, resonant in final voice-hollow and wing-steps. No moralizing; counter-reading (dams tomorrow) embraces ambiguity. Footprints' ripples reweight premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (cracks as maps, thunder as wings). Voice modulates rhythmically from hush to storm, diction biased toward fractured lyricism. No elision or head-hopping; compression purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (sparks illuminate oxbows); figurative pattern (cracks/maps, grace/glass) taught early, pays off without muddle. Minor overwrite in metaphors risks coherence in peak sparks beat but supports lyric texture without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drought-engineered ritual and echo-swallowing transforms philanthropy trope; risk in lyric CR heightens stakes. Watershed projection and cuckoo-nest inevitable from cracks motif. No derivatives; bold premise integrity.</comment>
