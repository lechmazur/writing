<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in the exchange—"honoring overlooked histories means returning what was taken"—earned by prior causality, with embodied cost ("exhaling a life") foreclosing the keeper role. Interiority concrete and particular, as in "warm as skin though it has not guided ships." Micro-choices under pressure, like speaking the lullaby backward, reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs accumulate to CR closure where fragment return reconfigures "intuition is not a compass but a tide," with cost legible in "absence weighs more than its presence." Orientation anchored early (translator on market catwalks); pattern taught by painting stall. Shard transition legible via "catwalk becomes that cliff."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice: swaying market overrides vertigo for step-through, pigments "warm" the past shard. Sensory selective (copper-salt air, rope hum), POV-biased toward overlooked details. Final spiral lanterns recharge beam motif, charging CR image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor histories via lens) tightens accumulatively through painting recognition and time-step, narrowing to return with agency-driven cost ("exhaling a life"). Escalation reweights via pattern break (boy turns), pressure coherent to Charged Poise in "pockets empty yet resonant."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: release anchors light, resonant in CR final image of makeshift lighthouse and "We keep the light by letting it go." Minor Thematic Echo deduction for articulated thesis line, but earned through particulars; no moralizing replaces scene pressure. Counter-reading lingers in "distance is one sentence long."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "brushstrokes become doorways," rhythmic modulation under pressure (short sentences in step-through). Stable first-person, no leakage; minimal dialogue natural ("Did you find what you sought?"). Voice as character: lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, propulsion matches needs (cadence accelerates in time-step); no loops, though "elusively tangible" repeats purposefully as motif. Minor overwriting in metaphors (e.g., market "folds into fog") but coherent, no muddle at peak. Read-aloud rhythm varies, final line recharges motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: painting time-loop self-return in alchemist market transforms tropes organically, risk-taking in lyric shard heightens stakes without gimmickry. Turn inevitable from lens motif; no close echoes, bold CR reweighting feels singular.</comment>
