<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in knowing he'll forget yet marking for future self, embodied in chalk residue and creaking joints; final realization earned by prior markers and tape. Minor reflective summaries slightly abstract emotion from peak hearing of frequency hum.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wandering to tape discovery/play, culminating in CR where prophet becomes "the sound of growing older" with cost of endless forgetting legible in final marking amid dissolving fog.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (VHS crunch, oxide sweetness, metallic fog taste) constrains choices via driftwood markers piercing mist; fog sculptures charge closure image of impermanence as "temporary monuments to vapor."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture aging sound) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through markers to tape's buried hum; agency in arranging/playing forecloses ignorance path with felt amnesia cost, though internal pressure dominates over external.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges organically from particulars like tape decay and fog dissolution; final CR reweights clinging vs. letting go without moralizing, resonant in "clinging to echoes was... honest form of letting go."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in decay scents and frequency hunts; rhythmic lyric voice modulates from search to charged poise at tape end, prose reflecting forgetful mind's crystalline-yet-fading clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel through sensory propulsion; figurative layering (fog as "breath made visible," tape as "time reversing") pattern-taught for lyric mode but borders overwriting in descriptive spirals, slightly dulling climax hum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prophetic amnesia, junkyard mysticism, and sonic aging in fog garden transforms memory tropes; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via markers to tape revelation.</comment>
