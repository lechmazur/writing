<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied conflict peaks in hesitation ripple to muscles, compelling earned renunciation of time-folding with offset footstep cost; contradictory imago refusal acts in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as nexus pulse/hologram density builds to sideways visions; Charged Poise closure in centered lever and offset step shows legible conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Aviary hush and nexus lattice constrain lever choice and charge final image; selective sensory (subsonic hum, glassy pinions) filters through mechanic's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moth-bats' interference patterns deepen stake from proof to chrysalis endurance; agency in stepping back forecloses path with unfiled report and mechanical companionship cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final lattice hologram reconfigures sideways time as choice doorway, resonating without moral; emerges organically from projections and futures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("time tilt sideways," "chilled honey" lever) modulates rhythmically under visions' pressure; stable single POV with lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Multi-job lines like "wings beat in slow motion, painting interference patterns" propel density without loops; varied rhythm peaks flawlessly in closure tilt.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sci-fi synthesis of holographic time-folding and moth-bat chrysalis transforms tropes into inevitable lattice-choice risk; bold lyric payoff heightens stakes.</comment>
