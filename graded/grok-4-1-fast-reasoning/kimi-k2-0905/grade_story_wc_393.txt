<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emil's motivation rooted in guilt and action over prayer compels the pivotal paper handover; contradictory impulses (prayers as "coins into dark well" vs. mechanical penance) act in scene with embodied pulse-matching tremor. Olya's secondary pressure via reluctant repair forces his resolve. Final choice earned by prior Rowan backstory cued concretely, foreclosing inaction with execution cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: heart delivery → repair attempt → Rowan quote → paper reveal → parcel dispatch, tightening to Charged Poise closure where music spills as second-opinion insistence. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (shop, heart, execution dawn). Closure cost legible in "gear is missing" and Emil's pocketed warrant syncing footsteps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shop's gears, loupe, dome, and storm lightning constrain repair choice and mirror internal states (tremor matches pulse). Recurring "vibrant hush" evolves to spilling lullaby charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (ticking heartbeat over rain) reflects Emil's stakes; no white-room, fully lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Rowan's innocence/redemption via repair/action) signaled early, tightens via paper's overlooked evidence forcing journalist delivery amid dawn deadline. Agency in Emil's handover narrows options (truth vs. witness duty); cost felt in unfixable "missing gear" and warrant weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mechanical contrition/second chances emerges from heart repair mirroring ignored evidence; final lullaby image reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in "machines don’t appeal their sentence" invites ambiguity on mercy. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV (Emil's perceptions dominant) with clean focalization; perceptual signature in "time recycled, penance mechanical." Dialogue natural/subtextual (Olya's warnings pursue caution goal). Rhythmic modulation peaks in "fragile lullaby" under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "ticking with a tremor that matched Emil’s own pulse" advances character/atmosphere/action); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor figurative density in storm/light beats borders overwrite but pattern-taught as motif payoff. No loops, clean propulsion to spilling music.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwork penance and innocence plea transforms death-row trope via tinker's tools as mercy agents. Risky lyric tone heightens stakes; final "imperfect, courageous beat" inevitable from gear motif without gimmick.</comment>
