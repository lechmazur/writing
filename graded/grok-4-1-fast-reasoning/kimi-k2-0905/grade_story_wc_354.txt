<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority shines through chess-specific perception and embodied worry stone handling; contradictory impulses (anxious fingering vs. emerging resolve) act simultaneously, earning the final smile and turn. No on-page relationships, but single-POV motivation intensifies credibly via pattern recognition. Minor label-speak ("hopeful melancholy") slightly abstracts peak emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early and holds: density of hums/patterns builds to CR closure ("exile was not an ending but a transposition"), reweighting premise with conceptual cost of past life foreclosed. Orientation anchors tutor/nexus/twilight by para 2. One tightening via resolved patterns suffices; cost legible in "greatest lesson... not in a marble hall but here."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nexus hums/electromagnetism and basalt stone constrain reflection (fingering translates silence), charge final image ("stone's dent a perfect fit for his thumb"). Sensory selectivity (pull on blood, purple twilight) reflects POV urgency; no white-room, coherent choreography in still/turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (correlate silence for meaning post-exile) signaled early, escalates via pattern break (hums → actionable notation) under Accum lens, narrowing to agency in final window. Felt cost in endured exile melancholy charges Charged Poise. One deepening suffices; no antagonist needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (beauty/sacrifice in difficulty transforms loss) emerges organically via chess analogies, reweighted in closure ("beauty... to be created, move by move") without moralizing. Final image resonates non-literally, inviting ambiguity on action's cost. No forced motifs; irony in "teaching too well" earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with chess-biased perceptual signature ("translating... algebraic notation into living strategy"); rhythmic modulation builds meditative intensity. No dialogue. Diction controlled, syntax reflects contemplative mind; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("dent" x5, "beauty in the difficult" x5+) and metaphor density (nearly every sentence figurative) create churn, dulling propulsion in reflective peaks; template echoes ("slow erosion... worn deeper"). Read-aloud rhythm varies but scaffold redundancies drag. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess exile + magnetic nexus yields non-obvious CR (life as infinite board); stone/nexus transform tropes organically. Bold lyric risk heightens meditative stakes without gimmickry; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
