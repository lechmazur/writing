<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in precision and balance compels choices like descending and declaring; traits shown through unpretentious actions. Internal conflict subtle but embodied in mercy over revenge. Final choice earned by prior search causality, with cost in historical mercy. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via messages to rune activation, closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (glamour unraveling) with legible conceptual cost in throne imbalance. Orientation anchored early (titan in temple library). Single scene, no shards; cost visible in "vis age melted" and sky exhaling. Persistent constraint (pellet hiding) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Library shelves, ink pellet, and dust motes constrain choices (creeping, hiding) and charge final image (rafters leaning, dust coronet). Sensory vivid and selective (rust scent, ink on fingertips, marble skin glow). POV-filtered through titan's precision. Environment evolves causally with sundering sigh.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmask pretender) signaled early, tightens via seventh-night arrival and titan intervention narrowing options. Escalation accumulative: messages to whisper to droplet flick, driven by agency. Cost unmistakable in pretender's exposure and library reconfiguration. One deepening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of illusion vs anchored truth emerges organically from ink rune, glamour sundering, and final rust reminder. Resonant non-literal answer in coronet dissolving and "sky freshly honest." Complexity in mercy amid balance; no moralizing. Final image reweights premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with mythic perceptual signature (e.g., "footfalls softer than parchment breath"). Voice rhythmic and biased toward precision, modulating elegantly under pressure. Minimal dialogue natural and declarative. No head-hopping; diction controlled for tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short breaths in climax); high density integrates action/image. Figurative coherent and purposeful (e.g., "cold starlight" threading veins), no muddle in peak. Minor density of metaphors in opener but pattern-taught; no loops or scaffolds. Propulsion clear to charged closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tiny titan, ink rune, and library unmasking transforms fantasy tropes via poetic specificity. Risky lyric style heightens stakes without obscurity. Turn inevitable from particulars; no derivative echoes. Bold conceptual integrity in drift/mercy.</comment>
