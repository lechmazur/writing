<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurelia's contradictory impulses (raised fist vs. trembling hand in opening pulse) act in scene, building to earned final crush of shard with dissolution cost. Interiority particular via recited stanza from trial and embodied visions. Flawlessly individual voice through poetic worldview under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via time pulses and visions, holds to CR closure: shard crush reconfigures revolution into new crystal with her dissolution cost legible in "body dissolved into the burnished sorrow." Orientation anchored by ~100 words; single scene coherent, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid's mirrors constrain storm survival choice and charge final light-burst image. Sensory details (obsidian pulse, velvet drapes, harmonic chime) selective via POV urgency, evolve causally. Micro-setting like collapsed harpsichord yields shard pivotally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reimagine civilization via shard) signaled early, escalates accumulatively: storm tightens via mirror-devise, archaeologist arrival forces climax trade-off. Agency in covering and crushing forecloses physical self with cost in palace's unchanged-yet-altered air. Pressure coheres to charged final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of reimagined revolution emerges via particulars (veiled mirrors ban resignation, poetic boulevards); final new crystal offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting failure into budding civ without moralizing. Subtext in shard's visions and archaeologist's poem-filled recorder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature ("dagger of light," "silk scarves soaked in blood") biases noticing; stable close-third POV with rhythmic modulation under stress. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual; no head-hopping, elisions taught via time motifs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "lifted it like a dagger of light and saw..."); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops/artifacts. Figurative language purposeful/patterned in poetic voice, coherent even in peak storm-beat; minor density risks in mirror-draping avoid closure harm.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible time, poetic shard-anthems, mirror-storms transforms revolution trope; risk in lyric sci-fi heightens stakes via reimagined civ payoff. Core premise (time-visible asteroid) inevitable in hindsight, no derivatives.</comment>
