<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete embodiment ("counted every rotation of the regret that orbited her heart") and earned change (breaking nib forecloses old relic's wholeness); contradictory impulses peak in pressing despite flare ("nib, thirsty for contradiction"). Minor poetic abstraction slightly distances raw emotion at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density rising through inscriptions colliding/sparking to ellipse shudder/crack (CR closure: shards scatter, new orbit forms with cost of broken nib and distant ghost). Orientation anchored early ("echoing observatory above clouds"); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring observatory elements (copper dome slit, slate floor pooling starlight, gears groaning) constrain choices (nib fits stylus) and charge final image (shrinks to "toy among toys"); sensory integration vivid/POV-biased (ink/thunder smell, rosewood scent).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redirect regret orbit) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening (words bend/collide/spark/shudder/flare) driven by agency, narrowing to nib-break trade-off with legible cost charging Charged Poise ("old orbit pass nearby, tipping its hat").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mutable regret emerges organically from proof inscriptions ("eternal orbit contradicts mutability"); final image ("wider, gentler" orbit allowing "future truths") offers resonant non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with distinct perceptual signature (journalistic/celestial fusion: "gears groaned like old editors"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("stars apologize?" tensions method). Rhythmic control modulates pressure seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density/propulsion with varied rhythm (short punchy peaks: "ellipse cracked open"); metaphors coherent/patterned (orbital/journalistic), no loops/artifacts dulling closure image ("splintered rosewood into first folded paper").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of newsprint heir + celestial proof-by-contradiction transforms regret trope into fresh, inevitable arc (nib-break rewrites gravity); risk-taking in metaphorical literalism heightens stakes organically.</comment>
