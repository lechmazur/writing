<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with micro-choices like adhesive analysis revealing competence under reverence; embodied steadiness ("hands did not tremble") earns final endurance as chain's link, balancing ingenuity with compassion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (adhesive → chain → keystone → lullaby) tighten density to Charged Poise closure where compromise resonates in bones; cost legible in "seasons of mistrust" reconfigured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Volcano's breathing and basalt benches constrain pacing chain to keystone; moonlight "dappled resolve" charges final image of river flowing together.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonize delegations) signaled early, deepens via lullaby modulating acoustics to force empathetic hearing; one tightening sufficient under Accumulative lens, with agency in sly singing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of ingenuity over victory emerges from particulars like adhesive lattice to lullaby harmony; final image of volcano's sigh offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with machinist perceptual bias (crystalline lattice, copper impurities); rhythmic control modulates with intensity, as in "grinding whisper" during keystone slide.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; minor figurative density ("silver coins of light") purposeful in opening but risks slight muddle—untouched at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of volcano mediator via acoustic lullaby transforms conflict tropes; chain's warm pulse inevitable from adhesive origins, risking bold acoustics payoff.</comment>
