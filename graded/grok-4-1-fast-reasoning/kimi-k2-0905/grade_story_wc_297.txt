<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (scars itching as antenna) and earned graft choice with contradictory fear/discovery impulses, but minor abstraction in "anxious elation" phrasing dilutes micro-choice specificity at the pivotal graft moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from clipping tug to maze visions and graft CR; on-page cost legible in "I would never leave the glade"; orientation anchored early in glade entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt glade and scars constrain choices (hedge unfolds via scar-link, thorns thread wounds), charging final rooted image; selective sensory vividness (metallic hush, sap-circuitry) mirrors visionary bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (balance dreams/steel via graft) signaled early, escalates via accumulative visions narrowing to withdraw/stay trade-off; agency in "I let the maze drink" with visible cost (rooted forever) under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of dream-soil/steel balance emerges organically from graft images, final cobalt leaf on sidewalk reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of eternal vigilance; no moralizing, resonant ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (footfalls as eclipses, thoughts branching); rhythmic poetic compression taught early, modulates anxiety in scar-graft peak without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image-chains, no loops; figurative density coherent in peak graft ("thorns threaded... stitching vegetable code") but borders overwriting, slightly dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scar-grafting topiary and early-future covenant transforms visionary trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via rooted silhouette close.</comment>
