<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied sensations like "numbers...tattoo her dreams" and micro-choice at crystal bargain reveals values; minor slip in lacking simultaneous contradictory impulses during peak pressure, but final renunciation earned with job loss cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from hashtag ghosts to crystal holograms; closure CR lands on-page with legible cost in "her own employee file flickered...badge photo pixelating," reweighting her from keeper to archive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal blocks humming lullaby notes constrain path deeper into farm and charge final empty Block 73 image; selective sensory hierarchy (humming, glowing warmth) mirrors POV's attentiveness without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover Aurora truth) signaled early via forbidden folder, tightens accumulatively at biometric bargain forcing trade-off; agency in palm-press forecloses employee path with visible erasure cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of absence refusing refill emerges organically from data ghosts to trending hashtag; final "rectangular hole...singing back" offers resonant non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("absence felt louder," pulsing timestamps) modulates rhythmically under pressure; stable single POV with purposeful compression teaches poetic elision paid off in chord-posting blank user.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., patch flex births map); rhythmic variety passes read-aloud, no loops/artifacts, metaphors consistent (dying stars, tattoo dreams) without muddle in closure.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corporate data-harvesting sci-fi with lullaby motif transforming absence into chorus; risk in AI-staged crash for grief-clicks feels inevitable from established memory economy.</comment>
