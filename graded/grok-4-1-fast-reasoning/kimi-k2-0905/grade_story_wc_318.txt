<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ellery's grief-rooted motivation intensifies through embodied micro-choices like gentler throttling after the sniffle, earning the final acceptance; contradictory hope shreds muscle in "heart macerated itself against his ribs," compelling higher-stakes endurance. Internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene without summaries. Final renunciation of revival feels earned with visible cost in sinking to knees.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: blower roar builds echo-density to laughter spillover, tightening to CR closure where "tending to the unspoken... giving absence a shape echoing can carry" reconfigures silence with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchors early via hourglass and tunnel. One meaningful deepening via sniffle-to-giggle shift narrows restoration options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel echo-chamber constrains choices by multiplying sounds into lullabies, charging final vibration into bones; blower as micro-setting handled tactilely guides tactics. Sensory hierarchy favors sound (ricochet chords, wet sniffle) filtered through Ellery's musical bias. Final image recharges tunnel's "concrete ribs" with mirth tremor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore laughter) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via engine-to-lullaby deepening that protagonist agencies through throttle adjustment, foreclosing literal revival. Cost legible in kneeling amid impossible giggle, charging wife's distant chuckle. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of shaped absence emerges organically from blower-echo particulars, reweighted in realization without moralizing; final house exhale answers restoration question non-literally via afterimage glow. Subtext in silence's "new" stitching lingers with ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from emergent wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature: sounds as "gusty crescendos" and "off-key wind"; rhythmic modulation heightens intensity (short sentences in roar buildup). Prose texture controlled, syntax reflects grief-distorted mind without filter excess. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: vivid images like "leaves in a frantic ballet" advance atmosphere and stakes without loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies (long undulating sentences to punchy "It grew"), read-aloud natural. Figuratives coherent and purposeful, no muddle in peak echo beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief via leaf-blower acoustics in tunnel transforms loss trope into textural haunting; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via pull-cord pendulum reprise. No echoes of templates, bold perceptual angle on memory.</comment>
