<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in texture obsession compel the endurance of flesh-bound choice; contradictory impulses surface in grotto reflections on Marcus and Mrs. Chen. Final renunciation earned via rope-handling progression. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing like "impossible choices deserve witnesses" borders therapy-speak without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of texture motifs (rope, clay) tightens to Charged Poise closure where walking with rope reconfigures transcendence stake with felt cost of remaining "still flesh." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no waivers needed. Cost legible in "rope coiled around my waist like a belt, like a question."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto and rope constrain choices (hiding spot, tactile decision anchor) and charge final image of starlit walk. Sensory hierarchy (warm pulse, shimmer, dried blood light) filtered through poet's tactile bias integrates seamlessly. Micro-setting of clay impressions evolves with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transcendence vs. textured choice signaled early, escalates accumulatively via rope discovery and writing to beings' presence forcing crystallization. Agency in walking past forecloses path with cost of curiosity from beings. One tightening suffices; visible price in "still discovering."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of choice's texture emerges organically from rope/clay recurrences shifting to weight vs. weightlessness; final image reweights without moralizing. Subtext in Mrs. Chen's tomatoes lingers ambiguity. Minor overtness in "sometimes they're about the texture of the moment" edges toward statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature (texture obsession in syntax/rhythm) stable in first-person POV; modulates from reflective to resolute. Purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged ending. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety; purposeful repetition of "rough where it broke, smooth where it held" pattern-taught without loops dulling propulsion. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors (e.g., "liquid starlight") during entry but coheres lyrically. Closure image clear and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alien transcendence via poet's tactile obsession transforms trope; rope as escape/choice anchor feels inevitable. Bold lyric risk in accumulative texture heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes.</comment>
