<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ari's infinite patience and weaver knowledge drive concrete micro-choices like breathing warmth on knots and cracking the fulgurite bead, earning the planting act with embodied cost; harbormaster adds crucible pressure. Minor slip: internal conflict leans accumulative rather than simultaneous impulses in peak confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from knot-decoding density to chime-completion and seed-planting CR, reweighting preservation stake with fog-aided escape cost; orientation anchors immediately in dock/harbor. Single scene causality holds without slips; final shoot image makes before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dock's golden planks groan to signal harbormaster, constraining escape and charging final shoot-through-snow image; fog muffles footsteps, reflects urgency via narrowed senses. Fulgurite sparks and rope textures filter through Ari's weaver bias, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode stanza for storm-corn) signaled early tightens via harbormaster interruption and rope chime, forcing plant/escape trade-off under textural lens. Agency in coaxing and cracking bead shows cost (lunge risk); one deepening suffices but lacks micro-turn reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Heritage-as-seed vs. glass-case theme emerges implicitly through knot syllables and dock planting, resonant CR in shoot proving methods live. No moralizing; final fibers-of-light image reweights premise with conceptual cost of bureaucratic erasure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical oceanic voice with perceptual signature (knots as phonemes, fog as hush) stable in close third; dialogue distinct—Ari's "seed, not glass case" poetic vs. harbormaster's recited bureaucracy. Rhythm modulates tension without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density in lines like "melted silica catch the light like tiny harbor moons" propels via varied rhythm, no loops or muddled metaphors; purposeful figuration taught early pays in fulgurite sparks. Minor density in opening but closure image crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fulgurite-fused knots encoding calendars transforms folklore into tactile world-logic, risking poetic density that heightens stakes organically. Final shoot inevitability from rope patterns feels fresh synthesis.</comment>
