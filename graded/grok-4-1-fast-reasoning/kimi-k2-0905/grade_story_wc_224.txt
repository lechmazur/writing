<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when tempted by custodian's quill-offer yet refuse via feather on forearm, earning final renunciation of talents with visible cost of eternal burial. Interiority concrete via mercury-glass skin cracking; motivation intensifies from pain to shared memory. Custodian applies pressure without headcount penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of feather-guidance, shadow pursuit, stone-touch builds to CR/RR closure where stone sinks, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of shared memory over personal power. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no shards exceed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Labyrinth shelves carved into stone constrain choices via feather-texture navigation; crow feather as micro-setting charges final arm-cracking. Sensory hierarchy (wet paper/thunder) reflects seer's storm-tasting bias, evolving to road straightening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (remap home sans guilt) signaled early, tightens via custodian's subtraction-deal forcing renunciation-agency; cost legible in talents' shard-rain and eternal seeding. Accumulative pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of prophecy-as-cage vs. shared memory emerges via stone's wheat-smell evoking true home, resonant in final sinking that reweights buried talents without moralizing. Particulars like feather-pyres avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in idiomatic phrasing like "syllables older than air"; rhythmic control modulates from corkscrew tension to dawn-release. Sparse dialogue subtextual ("Reality...by subtraction"); stable limited POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., feather "whispered whether...trapped weather"); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (eels/titles shift). Rhythm varies for ear-test peaks like lightning cataract.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mountain-bookstore premise synthesizes fresh via shifting sections/talent-seeding; risky lyric compression inevitable in hindsight at stone-sinking image. Transforms seer-tropes through mercury-shards refusal.</comment>
