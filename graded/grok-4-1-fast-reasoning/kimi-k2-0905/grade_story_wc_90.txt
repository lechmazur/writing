<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sister Halcyon's pacifist traits compel stitching despite holograms' warnings ("The door you open may not be mercy"), earning her fusion of sorrow/joy and eternal stay as visible cost in closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density of photo-stitching and joy-forged buoyancy; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands when ship roots as "seed rather than a coffin" with her permanence as undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recycled hull "stitched from ribs of dead cruisers" and emotion-tuned gravity spinner constrain entry, mirroring her internal lift; photos as micro-setting charge sail-raising and final blooming.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (open dimension via joy countering deaths) tightens accumulatively in stitching under whispers' pressure; her defiant happiness forecloses return as hatch closes with felt isolation cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of redeemed grief emerges via photos reviving in "vast auditorium of light"; final "quiet lantern rather than final bomb" reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias toward ghostly photos ("shards of collective shadow work") modulates rhythmically to peak in "joy flooded her—not naive, but forged"; stable single POV teaches pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (ship "drifting upward through dimensions like a sigh") propels without loops; varied rhythm peaks in closure image of vines blooming, no artifacts dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-human pacifism and emotional gravity transforms sci-fi tropes; risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off when Tear dissolves into "rain that fell upward," heightening stakes organically.</comment>
