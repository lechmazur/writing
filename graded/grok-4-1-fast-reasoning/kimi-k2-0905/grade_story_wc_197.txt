<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's interiority shines in embodied details like palm to boardwalk and azimuth adjustment under drone pressure, rooting her resourcefulness in grandmother's stories; micro-choices reveal values with cost (barefoot sprint risks capture). Minimal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously prevent 9+; resolute competence lacks visible flaw complication at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hybrid Causal-Accumulative lens holds: causal linkages (drones pivot → sprint → unlock → playback → record → wire) build textural density to CR closure in final ring and puddle map reweighting histories with social cost (officers hesitate). Orientation anchored early; persistent key constraint shapes tactics to charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Auric lagoon, puddles, starlight constrain choices (reflections guide booth location, glow concentrates path) and charge final image (new map in puddle); sensory hierarchy (Mira's biased notice of Orion glints as Morse) integrates with action. Body/setting micro-focus (damp boardwalk echo) mirrors internal stakes without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim histories vs. indifference) signaled early, escalates via agency-driven tightening (plan unravel → drone return forces final wiring under spotlight, narrowing to arrest risk). Cost legible in hands-raised stance; no live option foreclosed earlier pulls from 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. indifference emerges organically from particulars (erased reels → looping whisper → chorus); final puddle image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Returning reflections shift from guidance to impossible-silencing map with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited voice stable with perceptual signature (light as language/waveform); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure (short sprints amid poetic swells). No dialogue; purposeful elision of backstory paid in present choices; diction fits young rebel's resourceful idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and image integration, but figurative language dominates high-pressure playback/climax beats ("starlight braided into copper") without full pattern restraint, risking overwrite (−0.5); no loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stencils/phones, puddle-waveform maps, backward-broadcast revisions transforms dystopian tropes via grounded Mira; risk-taking in lyric causality heightens closure stakes, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
