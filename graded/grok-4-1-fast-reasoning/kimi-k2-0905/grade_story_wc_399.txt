<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority via scar exposure and peripheral method revealing past failure's cost; micro-choices like thrice perimeter walk show value hierarchy. Minor slip: internal conflict more implied than simultaneous impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to clearing's manifestation as distortion "between thoughts"; closure RR via echo stabilization with felt devotion cost in final mask replacement and departure. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening via ritual response suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Kinetic parapet constrains via responsive hums/gear shifts shaping consecration; recurring whispers/columns charge final image of preserved echo waiting beneath sands. Sensory hierarchy (peripheral, tactile) biases to seeker's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve fading echo) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via walks → manifestation → oblique consecration narrowing to respectful distance; agency in ritual forecloses direct grasp with scar-tied cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of indirect preservation emerges via particulars like "looking slightly away from" star/echo; final image reconfigures premise with undeniable conceptual cost of wisdom's otherness, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in oblique acknowledgments; rhythmic prose modulates from thrumming sync to dawn calm, diction controlled for mystic texture without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "stone grinding... synchronized with his heartbeat"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures like "trapped moths" enhance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual world-logic (peripheral preservation) transforms mystic tropes; risk in non-physical closure via distortion space heightens stakes organically.</comment>
