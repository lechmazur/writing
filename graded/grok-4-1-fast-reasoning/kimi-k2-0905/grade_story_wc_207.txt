<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and embodied emotion, as in knees buckling from psychometry vision; motivation intensifies compellingly to tribute release; final transformation earned via prior micro-choices without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure; orientation anchored early (pier, factory shutdown); compass-tugged descent and vial release deliver on-page cost in final integration image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sensory details like fossil confetti and upward rain constrain choices (vial use, stone reading) and charge lagoon climax; POV-filtered hierarchy prioritizes scents purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (explanations' failure point) signaled early, texturally escalates via hinged visions to agency-driven tribute; cost legible in vial release and compass dissolution foreclosing collector identity.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings/transitions emerges organically through petrichor and hinges, reweighted in final "hinge herself" image without moralizing; resonant ambiguity in perpetual whistle lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with scent-biased perceptual signature modulates seamlessly under pressure; stable close third-person; purposeful compression taught early pays off in surreal closure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety; figurative pattern (hinged, exhaling stone) coherent and propulsive; no loops, though minor metaphor density in climax avoided via payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry and petrichor alchemy transforms surreal tropes; risk-taking in upward rain and internal compass heightens stakes organically to inevitable CR.</comment>
