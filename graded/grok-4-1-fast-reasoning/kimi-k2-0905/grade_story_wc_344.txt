<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rowan's motivation to learn repair's rhythm is embodied in his irregular heart and chipped key, driving micro-choices like testing gears amid doubt; internal conflict emerges in "doubt hissed like thawing steel" before the mirror realization forces forgiveness. Final shift to custodian feels earned via prior causality. Minor slip: impulses not fully simultaneous in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mirror patterns build density to break with "reflections showing the moment just before the mistake," yielding on-page RR (Charged Poise) in workshop where clocks tick inward, door vanishes—cost legible in lost return yet gained rhythm. Orientation anchored early in library arrival. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mirrors and frost constrain pivotal choice (healing key via glass), charging closure; sensory details like "boots squealing on crystal floors" and "breath unfurled as silver gauze" filter through locksmith's priorities, evolving causally. Micro-setting (flawed key, gears) mirrors internal flaw. Final workshop image recharges cloud-sea anchors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock rhythm) signaled early tightens accumulatively: failed gears narrow options, mirror insight deepens to key-healing agency, foreclosing flawed self with conceptual cost in trapped-yet-rhythm-gained poise. Pressure coheres under lens; one decisive intensification suffices. Protagonist alteration drives resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgiving slipped gears emerges organically from mirror-healing and inward-ticking clocks, reweighting repair as self-forgiveness without statement; final image ("custodian of every eclipse yet to unlock") offers resonant CR, charging prior scraps-of-prophecy motif with non-literal cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with locksmith perceptual signature (mechanisms as heart metaphors); voice texture modulates rhythmically, e.g., "key turned counterclockwise like winding back a disastrous dawn." Purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly at closure. No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax and rhythmic variance (short doubt beats amid long image sentences); figures pattern consistently (ice/moons/clocks) without muddle in peak mirror beat. Minor scaffold: "hauntingly bright" reprise borders redundancy but ties aurora motif. Closure image clear, no loops dulling it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith fantasy with mirrors-as-discarded-drafts transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric closure (trapped workshop as repair) heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via prophecy setup. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity throughout.</comment>
