<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in hesitation before pressing petal, earning fusion of insight/empathy with embodied cost (sinking to knees, discarded armor); chemist's pressure reveals her blind spot without stereotypes. Minor label-speak ("insight without empathy was just surveillance") doesn't flatten peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layers of scent/emotion build density to RR closure ("They had fused her") with legible cost (detachment foreclosed, vial cracks). Orientation anchored immediately (grotto, dusk, Lira/chemist); single scene coherent, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Amber dust, fossilized sap, fading copper light constrain and charge final image (palm to ground hum); sensory hierarchy (resin/static/scent) reflects Lira's priorities, evolves causally with dusk/transformation. Micro-setting (petal on pulse) mirrors internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (real emotion vs. detachment) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via petal press releasing client echoes, forcing renunciation; cost unmistakable ("let it hurt... as proof"). Agency in choice sustains pressure to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Half-truths emerge organically through client grief/rage/wonder, reweighted in fusion without statement; final image (residue breathing, earth hum) offers resonant non-literal answer to truth-need, embracing ache's complexity. No moralizing or binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (scent/static as bias); diction/rhythm modulate from detached to porous ("scent bloomed like a bruise"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You'll feel what they felt... but not why"), distinct voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density (scent layers multi-job), varied rhythm accelerates to closure; minor overwriting (honeyed regret/citrus) purposeful for textural lens, no loops/artifacts dulling peak ("grotto now a cathedral of static and scent").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotion-distilling/scent-subsuming transforms trope via static-sensing physics; risk in lyric accumulation inevitable to "porous, aching affection," heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
