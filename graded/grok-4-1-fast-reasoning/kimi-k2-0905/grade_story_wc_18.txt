<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied interiority peaks in slashing palm with sextant ("jagged edge catching the aurora"), revealing contradictory risk for reintegration; final choice earned via mother's sync priming solitude's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via breath density to 13th seam tear and blood solder; on-page RR closure in sapling image reconfigures dream with blood cost legible in "bleeding palm against the pane."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frost constrains via pulse-sync on gears and melting dew charges final orchard rebirth; selective senses (moldy apples, crunching frost) filter through maker's priorities, mirroring internal fog dispersal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture dream) tightens via taunting flicker and blood trade-off narrowing to pulse tether; agency in decisive slash forecloses solitude path with palm cost felt under accumulative cadence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of boundary reformation emerges via glass mountains rooting; final sapling reweights premise non-literally without moral, resonant in "breathe them into new forms."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (mirrors, frost plumes, auroras) biases toward breath/glass; rhythmic control modulates with sync cycles, stable close-third POV enhances dream intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in "aurora folded into her chest like silk collapsing into a needle’s eye"; varied rhythm propels breaths without loops, though minor figurative density in corridor nears overwrite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes dream-capture trope via blood-sextant restore and breath-ritual in fog orchard; fresh "heart’s mirror swing" risks lyric fantasy, inevitable in hindsight sapling payoff.</comment>
