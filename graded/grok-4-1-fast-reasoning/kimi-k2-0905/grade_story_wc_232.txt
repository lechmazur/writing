<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Internal conflict shines in hesitation at doorway ("thinking of his quiet life... comfort"), earning the final step-through with felt cost of abandoning solitude; traits like map passion lack shown via contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via discovery-chip → ants → cavern → doorway shimmer, culminating in on-page Decisive Change ("Elias stepped through the doorway") with legible cost in fading old life; orientation anchored early, one tightening sufficient for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bioluminescent fungi and stone doorway constrain final choice and charge closure image; selective sensory details (warmth in fingers, rushing water) integrate purposefully, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (choose true path) signaled via promise/chip, escalates causally through flood-risk follow and hesitation narrowing to fear vs. possibility; agency in step-through forecloses old life with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of possibility over fear emerges organically from margins/promise motifs reweighted in final step; resonant non-literal closure image avoids moralizing, inviting ambiguity in "welcoming the new."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (symbols shifting, ants purposeful); rhythmic prose modulates from dusty calm to cavern glow without head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels causally; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull closure—final line's image ("creek continued to rise, carrying away the old life") clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of matrix chip symbol, ant trail through flood to decision-doorway transforms portal trope via cartographic inheritance; risk in empirical intuition payoff feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
