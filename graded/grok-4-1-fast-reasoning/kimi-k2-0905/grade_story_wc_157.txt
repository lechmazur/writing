<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arlo's rogue charm shines in the Lucretius passphrase and Voss deflection, compelling the escape micro-choice with embodied defiance rooted in taxed dreams; no unearned epiphanies, traits constrain under drone pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: seed-planting triggers Voss arrival, passphrase activates pollen escape, sealing warp with future vision as CR closure; cost legible in drone scythe and satellite deadline, orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains signals (stem snaps, beetle path) and escape (pollen clouds); recurring vines/bees mirror defiance, charging final "Resist" bloom without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (plant glyphs before dawn) tightens via Voss confrontation, forcing passphrase trade-off; agency in warp residue slip forecloses capture path with felt risk, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Defiance theme emerges from glyph-vision payoff reweighting surveillance premise; final rooftops/bees image answers spark-guarding question with conceptual cost of untaxed dreams, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with tax/chaos perceptual signature modulates under stress; Voss dialogue carries subtext ("auditing my own thoughts"), distinguishing cryptic idiom without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in peak Voss beat (metaphors like "spent bullet casing" cluster without pause) dulls one propulsion beat −0.3; no loops, clean syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh taxed-thoughts premise transforms rebel trope via plant glyphs and vegetal code; risk-taking in cryptic signals heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
