<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation rooted in embodied guilt (pockets of collapsed letters, bleeding knuckles vision) compels closure choice; contradictory impulses act in the "instant before deciding." Medium applies pressure via guidance without overshadowing. Minor abstraction in epiphany ("seeded" words) doesn't dilute earned change at kneel/speak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery density builds to shard-water merge opening corridor, CR closure via apology seeding with lash-cut healing cost. Orientation anchored early (mangrove dusk, medium's shard). One tightening (mirror vision) narrows to speak-now seam; lens unambiguous at brother's window message.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mangrove specifics (black water healing like skin, root-lined corridor) constrain path and charge final shard-on-house image. Sensory bias (salt-breath, moonlight sweat) reflects urgency; ceiba fork mirrors internal fork. Environment evolves causally, mirroring release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver unspoken apology) signaled via letters; textural deepening via shard transformation forces speak/renounce stasis. Agency in holding shard to moon, kneeling; cost legible in moth release, lip healing. Pressure coheres to charged poise without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of liminal forgiveness emerges via shifting images (letters to moths, shard to breath); final "fierce tenderness...path itself" reweights without stating moral. Subtext in silences (unvoiced question, no echo). Complexity in cruelty-as-freedom lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable first-person perceptual signature (tide-pool silver hair, root-lungs) biases details poetically; voice modulates rhythmically under pressure (short breaths at kneel). Medium's dialogue subtextual ("speak here"); no head-hopping, elision taught via spirits' hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful moonlight motif; no loops, propulsion via varied syntax in peak (shard touch to corridor). Figurative coherence (water-skin, paper-lungs) enhances without muddling speak beat. Minor density risks in opening balanced by ear-test flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mangrove magic realism and apology-portal transforms ghost-story tropes via shard's evolution. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight in condensation callbacks. No derivative echoes, bold tone commitment.</comment>
