<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nara's embodied determination shines in limping descent and plant-vow, revealing contradictory impulses of frailty and rebellion; guard interaction forces micro-choice with visible cost. Final tuck under ribs earns change via prior causality. Single-POV interiority particular and pressure-tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: kite script decodes coords because/therefore grotto action; orientation anchored by para 2. Closure DC via embryo alteration and escape, cost legible in "knees screaming" and guard risk at "tucked it inside her blouse."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Volcanic setting constrains via 52-degree basin and slick stairs, charging climax; sensory hierarchy (hiss, steam, pumice) POV-filtered through gardener lens. Micro-setting (basalt basin, moss vine) guides choices and mirrors internal alchemy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (alter embryo vs. council/guard) signaled early, tightens via guard footsteps forcing pollen micro-turn; agency in nicking sac forecloses compliant path with somatic cost. Escalation causal, cost unmistakable in tremor and radio threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mutating tradition emerges via garden motifs shifting from bomb craters to epigenetic splice; final "why" and rustling plants offer resonant CR without moralizing. Subtext in kite whisper and vow layers ambiguity productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with perceptual signature (plant "whisper," "chlorophyll surged"); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive to taut in grotto ("minutes before his radio crackled"). No head-hopping; voice biased toward botanical intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and image integration ("letters that rearranged themselves like seedlings"); minor figurative density in climax ("photosynthetic panic") coherent but borders overwrite without muddle. Zero loops; propulsion peaks at pollen bloom.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-war biotech alchemy via plant telepathy and kite cipher transforms tropes organically; risk in moss gamble and epigenetic nick heightens stakes inventively. Premise commits fully, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
