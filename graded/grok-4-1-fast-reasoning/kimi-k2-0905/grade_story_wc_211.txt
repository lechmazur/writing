<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation rooted in lifelong vow to archive, with contradictory impulses peaking when Ambrose chooses to immerse the shaving despite instinct to archive, earning final endurance with embodied cost in tilting orchard and rustling fruits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly from wax grooves forming Hittite to final transmutation; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with undeniable conceptual cost in "orchard would be gone—trees, wax, ledger, all—transmuted into the soft velvet disquiet," reweighting archive inversion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices vividly—stone basin enables immersion triggering vision, quinces bear faces pressuring realization, Judean date palm anchors final forehead press charging closure image; sensory hierarchy (warm soil, greasy rainbow) reflects scribe's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to archive vs. silence prophecy tightens accumulatively through shaving's changing syllables and vision reversal, forcing agency in immersion and writing; cost legible in prophetic cruelty and foghorn migrating into him, foreclosing isolation-free path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of oaths/patterns inverting to archive the archiver emerges organically from wax waveform, fruit faces chanting "to remain," and final speaking into xylem; resonant non-literal closure reweights premise without moralizing, lingering in velvet disquiet.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in dead-language attunement and sensory bias (wax as "caramel curl," grooves "trembling waveform"); rhythmic control modulates from moan-quiver opening to charged poise in final waiting, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or artifacts, high density with multi-job lines (e.g., "letters sank, then rose again as raised braille" advances plot, theme, closure); varied rhythm propels accumulatively, read-aloud ear perfect, no figurative muddle in peak vision beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oath scribe hearing accidental Hittite prophecy in wax shaving atop skyscraper orchard transforms relic tropes via specific physics (friction of childish hands); risk-taking lyric accumulation heightens stakes inevitability in transmutation image.</comment>
