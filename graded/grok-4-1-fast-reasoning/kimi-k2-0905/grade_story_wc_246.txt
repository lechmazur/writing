<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's confidently uncertain trait embodies contradiction in the editing beat ("Confidence flickered; uncertainty steadied her hand"), compelling the unbent filament choice with felt cost of floating detachment. Interiority particular via sensory ties to anomaly and pen. Final renunciation of tidy certainty earned through prior causal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from anomaly flare to filament edit, culminating in Charged Poise closure as revised scroll reconfigures seeds from wrong to early, with cost of "future loops" legible in final logging. Orientation anchored by ~50 words. Single scene causality intact via motivated pen vibration to scratch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Anomaly as micro-setting constrains editing choice (tugs bones, slackens gravity during rewrite), charging final hum as invitation. Viewport, comm-garden, log-scroll tactile and evolved (lights dim, power borrowed). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: recycled air regret mirrors interpretation struggle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (threshing meaning post-wrong seeds) signaled early, tightens texturally via filament naming/deepening to unbend, narrowing options with embodied cost (floating, power drain). Agency in poised nib scratches despite dry pen. Ongoing loops felt as price in ending poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of uncertainty as truest coordinate emerges organically from glyph-sprouts to revised lullabies, resonant non-literal answer in final whisper/image of warmth in boots reweighting interpretation premise. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers via "history would remember itself slightly differently."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in filament metaphors and cosmic gardening idiom; diction/rhythm modulates from stuttered gravity to steady whisper. Purposeful compression taught early (poetic glyphs) pays off legibly at closure. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pen scratched despite its dryness, etching absence that glowed; each line tugged filaments"); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor metaphor density in edit beat coherent via taught pattern, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of iridium pen editing cosmic filaments transforms history tropes into threshed contingency; risk-taking in nonlinear causality (effect before cause) heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via mentor's prune image repriced at closure.</comment>
