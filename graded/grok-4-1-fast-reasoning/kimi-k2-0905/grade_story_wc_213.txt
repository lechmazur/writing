<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied curiosity in barometer logging and rope grip reveals contradictory impulses (routine vs. listen); final realization earned by micro-choices like tying servo, with visible cost in unauthorized risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via pressure dips and rope twitch causal chain to CR closure; anomaly collapse post-bell legible cost in "humbled quiet," orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Barometer tremors and balcony gusts constrain toggle decision; clouds surge and after-ring charge final image, sensory hierarchy POV-specific to microclimate ear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tug forces bell-over-siren trade-off, tightening stake accumulatively; agency in 03:59 switch forecloses routine with data payoff cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Courtesy—answering when the world whispers" reweights listening premise non-literally via lingering notes image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara's perceptual signature ("sonic map of the invisible downdraft") and hush-to-peal rhythm control pressure; stable close-third POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>"Warm stones dropped into cold milk" propels climax density without muddle; zero loops, varied rhythm accelerates to tolls.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mountain voicing via bell/rope synthesizes microclimate trope into dialogic courtesy; risk of anthropic sanctuary heightens stakes organically.</comment>
