<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak at railing—"purity felt like amputation"—earn final sculpting choice with embodied cost in tears blurring notes and snapped quill; interiority concrete via archival lens on borrowed memories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: image density tightens from measurements to pellet strike and quill snap, landing CR closure in sculpted figure's blank face as felt cost of fragmentation; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains via whispers guiding "Fragment is also form" realization; lightning-statue shadows and fog pellets charge final image, sensory hierarchy archival (footsteps as syllables).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—identity amid ossification—deepens via pellet's borrowed joy forcing railing stance; agency in arranging pellets forecloses erasure with cost of "pockets empty" under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mosaic memory emerges via quill snap → tiles' whisper → figure sculpting, resonant non-literal answer in "blushing into someone the rain would remember"; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (memories as stones/palimpsest) modulates rhythm to hush under stress; stable third-limited, diction biases toward archival texture without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring storm hush; coherent metaphors (shadows as ivy, fog as mold) without muddle, zero loops, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fog-memory ossification and self-sculpting transforms identity tropes; risk in lyric fantasy heights stakes via whispering tiles' pivot, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
