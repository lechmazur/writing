<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The carver's meditative patience drives micro-choices like following the butterfly and sitting among headstones, earning the final transformation; embodied grief in "finally allowing herself to feel the weight" reveals contradiction. Repetitive trait labels ("thoughtful," "fiercely meditative") slightly generalize interiority without deeper flaw complication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via deepening discoveries (butterflies, chrysalises, headstones) to CR closure in chrysalis burst; cost legible in "living tomb" undergoing transformation that reconfigures carving purpose. Orientation anchored in opening line; single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse specifics (cracked pots, rusted cans, oak through ceiling) constrain path-tracing and charge final image; sensory hierarchy meditative (shadows as wings, glowing poem-wings). Details evolve with dusk-to-dawn light, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief's shape) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through poem-shrouds and sleep-carved stones, narrowing to personal transformation; agency in patient following forecloses stone-carving path with chrysalis cost. One decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief as poem-wrapped transformation emerges organically from particulars (ribbon-butterfly match, headstone poem-titles); final image reweights "carve absence into presence" without statement, lingering ambiguity on living memorials.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with meditative perceptual signature (wingbeats as language, warm ribbon); rhythmic prose modulates from calm observation to intensified swarm. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "wings bearing the exact pattern of the ribbon" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm suits accumulative build. Minor loops in "thundering calm" and trait reiterations dull propulsion slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of butterflies carrying village poems transforms grief trope into lived metamorphosis; risk in surreal mentorship (sleep-carvings) heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from ribbon seed.</comment>
