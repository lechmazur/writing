<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scraps' retired status creates intuitive conflict resolved in the riddle solve, where nose translates scent into syntax with embodied cost; contradictory impulses act when she feels "the old tug anyway." Kite's trembling fingers reveal stakes under pressure. Final choice to lead earns prior motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds from leaf/cylinder to coordinates, culminating in CR closure where leaf softens on threshold, reweighting separation with orchard smoke cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Scrapyard/wasteland constrains via scents guiding travel and relics enabling solve; recurring leaf charges final image as wax softens in sun. Sensory hierarchy (nose over sight) shapes choices throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue via closeness) signaled early, tightens accumulatively at leaf-on-cylinder press revealing coordinates, forcing journey with digging cost; agency in Scraps' nudge forecloses separation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of preserved closeness emerges from relic particulars, final image resonantly reweights riddle without moral: "every separation was merely a groove waiting...to read it aloud."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature via scent-syntax bias; rhythmic compression taught early peaks purposefully in riddle unfold without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but dense figuratives like "spilled blood that had decided to become a sunrise" risk minor coherence dip in peak riddle beat; no loops obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Scent-as-language and relic-groove synthesis transforms post-apoc tropes organically; risk-taking in dog's POV heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight at cylinder kiss.</comment>
