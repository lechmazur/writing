<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied calm under dream chaos reveals character via weaving actions, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal revelation; composite man's touch forces micro-choice without deeper internal conflict shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure ("she had never been mapping connection from outside it—she was the thread"); cost legible in empty spool and dissolution; orientation anchored early, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gallery's impossible geometry constrains weaving and charges final image ("walls breathing with the rhythm of human hearts"); sensory details (tasting nostalgia, smelling awakening) mirror internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of connection) tightens accumulatively via gallery shifts and man's dissolution, forcing stance crystallization; agency in accelerated weaving narrows options with felt cost in empty spool.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from weaving particulars to CR ("connection's texture was simply the weight of being witnessed"); resonant final image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with dream-biased perceptual signature ("paintings bled...auroras of pigment that tasted like nostalgia"); man's dialogue subtextual and voice-distinct; stable close third-person POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid rhythm, but figurative overload in peak beats ("walls erupting...patterns becoming more complex") risks coherence (−0.4); minor paraphrase loops ("memories alter" phrasing twice) dull momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream architecture and neural connections feels inevitable; risk-taking in Möbius geometry and living gallery heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
