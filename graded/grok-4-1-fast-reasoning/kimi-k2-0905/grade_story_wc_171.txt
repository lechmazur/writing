<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's contradictory impulses—burn the clipboard to release ghosts vs. realizing ritual demands remembering rightly—act in scene via trembling hands and speaking names, earning the final transformation to gardener of memory with visible cost of empty hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: offerings and names build density to collective cairn and clipboard shattering into lights, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure with cost in crumbling terrace and shared burden imaged on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Terrace's pulsing silver veins and obsidian reflecting war constrain ritual choices (altar warmth, starlight-dipped lily) and charge final image of purposeful crumbling, with sensory selection (glowing petals, echoing chorus) mirroring internal grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor peace via redemption ritual) deepens accumulatively through realization "demanded more," drawing others to cairn and forcing collective witness; cost legible in distributed weight foreclosing solo negotiation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of peace as daily flawed practice emerges implicitly from shared cairn and lily's "flawed beauty," with final image of standing together and crumbling terrace offering resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (weighted eyes, heartbeat-synced veins) and rhythmic modulation (lyrical swelling to silent aftermath); purposeful compression teaches pattern, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via integrated images (clipboard softening to cradle); no loops or artifacts, though minor figurative density in ritual beats stays purposeful without muddling peak cast-into-sky moment.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual redemption transforms negotiator tropes via clipboard-to-light-shards and collective grief-cairn, with risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightening stakes organically.</comment>
