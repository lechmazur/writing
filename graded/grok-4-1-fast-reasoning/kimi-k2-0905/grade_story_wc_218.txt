<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation rooted in turning diagnosis into deadline compels remodeling choices with embodied tremor steadied by wire; internal conflict subtle but shown in brazen calm amid decline. Minor slip: limited simultaneous contradictory impulses, more endurance than contradiction. Final choice to leave diary and walk away earned with pulse transfer cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from split oak to synchronized inhale; orientation anchored early (caretaker, temple orchard). Closure as Charged Poise in orchard's chime and synchronization with legible conceptual cost (her pulse encoded, death transfers agency). No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (granite breathes, copper hums like hummingbird); setting constrains via pillars approving conductivity, wire burial completing circuit. Final image charged by copper dust footprints reabsorbed. POV bias filters professionally (grafting notes, micro-amp spikes).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (remodel for interspecies treaty before death) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via bats roosting, fox family witnessing, hand tremors vibrating as lullaby; one tightening in final spiral weave narrows to signature moment. Agency in persistent wiring forecloses death-as-failure with orchard's tempo cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies treaty emerges organically via particulars (bilingual fruit, bats tuning to frequency); final orchard broadcast reconfigures premise without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in kits chasing chamomile sparks, lingering ambiguity of eternal contract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (oaks translate tremor as lullaby); voice modulates rhythmically, prose as character in gently systematic weave. Spoken lines to orchard/fox carry subtext of consent; no head-hopping, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (every line advances texture/pressure); metaphors coherent/patterned (fossilized lightning, diving bird spiral), no loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies read-aloud, climax sharpened without overwriting; minor figurative density serves accumulative lens without muddling closure chime.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living architecture, micro-currents, sap/ore treaty transforms tropes into inevitable pulse-transfer; risk in anthropomorphic stone/oak bold yet coherent. Final reconfiguration (orchard at heart cadence) feels earned hindsight, no derivative hedging.</comment>
