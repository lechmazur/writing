<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's jittery embodiment (heart waltz, clutching hands) transforms credibly into "weight of becoming" at climax, earning change with prior micro-choices; woman's brief pressure reveals his limits without headcount blur. Minor slip in over-articulated realization ("Elias understood then") borders unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as vibration density and aurora motifs build to CR closure: pendant dissolution reconfigures courier-to-legend with legible conceptual cost ("no longer worried about being remembered correctly"). Orientation anchored early; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora and ridgeway as "seam where reality grew thin" constrain climax choice and charge final image; sensory selectivity (dripping light, honey-thick air) filters through Elias's relic-attuned POV, mirroring internal fade.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (routine delivery vs. extraordinary vibration) tightens accumulatively via pendant sync and woman encounter, forcing stance crystallization; cost felt in transformation's foreclosure of ordinary self, legible in "walked forward into his new nature."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of myth germinating from routine emerges organically via relic deliveries and final CR image; woman's lines carry subtext without overt sermon, though final narration edges thematic echo, slightly diluting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable Elias-centric POV with perceptual bias (wonder from routine); rhythmic diction modulates intensity (short waltz beats to extended eternities); dialogue subtextual and distinct (woman's centuries-weight vs. Elias's managed reply).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("extending," "vibrating sympathetically") taught early for lens; minor overwriting in climax metaphors (liquid sky to honey air) coherent but dense without muddle. No loops or scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courier mythos with meta-transformation risks bold lyric compression; ridgeway-as-seam and pendant dissolution feel inevitable, transforming tropes via specific fade-to-myth premise.</comment>
