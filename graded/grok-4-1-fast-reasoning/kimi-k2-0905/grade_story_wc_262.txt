<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete embodiment (tingling fingertips during psychometry) and micro-choices under pressure (scratching lyrics on final frame), earning the release with contradictory seeking/loop realization. Final renunciation of stored grief feels compelled by causal buildup of visions and mother's postscript.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of film/letter visions tightens to CR closure in "film strip...threading into Mara’s chest," with legible emotional cost in tears blurring ink. Orientation anchored immediately in booth; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via narrow stair descent and velvet aisle search, charging final image of cigarette case discovery; sensory hierarchy (visual overlays, tactile celluloid) reflects Mara's spatial imagination. Projection booth as micro-setting evolves causally with storm/rain applause.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lyrics/unused love) signaled early deepens accumulatively through self-threading film and filled letter, narrowing to release with agency in scratching/singing; cost unmistakable in "tears blurred the ink" before warmth hatches.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of stored love emerges organically from film-loop particulars, reweighting premise in final chest-threading image without moralizing; resonant postscript ("Love is never unused") integrates as earned CR, inviting ambiguity in ongoing projection potential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (overlays of "ushers with flashlights, lovers sharing popcorn") stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation heightens psychometry beat without head-hopping or elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful film metaphors (dust as "slow film frames") propels without loops; minor figurative density in visions serves pattern, but varied syntax avoids monotony in closure projection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry-film psychogeography transforms ghost-story tropes, with self-threading reel as inevitable turn grown from booth's incubated sentiments; risk in lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
