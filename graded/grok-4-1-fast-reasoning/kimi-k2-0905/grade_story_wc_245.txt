<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses shine in "the vertigo of almost loving, the ache of remembering a dream upon waking," rooting the earned shift to mapping his own grief; flaws like fear drive struggle without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly from sensory buildup to RR closure at "He traced them, understanding at last that to navigate uncharted emotional depths one must become the map"; cost legible in emptied ring and internalized cartography, orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest and body-as-setting (skin tasting citrus frequencies) constrain choices throughout and charge final image of lines sinking like seeds; selective synesthesia mirrors emotional mapping without overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-mapping tightens via spiral trail and ring's bloating weight under Accumulative lens, forcing embodied agency (inhaling notes, kneeling); cost unmistakable in "warm pressure like tears that refused to fall" and foreclosed blank interior.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of becoming one's own map emerges organically from particulars, resonant CR in "raised ink of his palms, transferred to every surface he touched"; no moralizing, ambiguity in "private meridian zero" invites rereading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV delivers distinct perceptual signature through skin-centric noticing ("syllables sinking through pores like warm ink"); rhythmic modulation peaks at closure without slippage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful synesthetic figures (no muddle, pattern taught early), propulsion varies rhythmically; minor repetition of "quiet blaze" motif charges closure without looping into scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, emotional cartography, and skin-as-interface transforms sensory tropes; risk in ultrasonic rules heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via ring's release.</comment>
