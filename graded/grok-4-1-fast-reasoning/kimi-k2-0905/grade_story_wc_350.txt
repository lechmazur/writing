<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong particular traits shown through embodied feelings like "wheeze and hunger as off-key chords," with micro-choices like language selection aligning with choral librarian identity; closure change earned via her vigil. Minor lack: no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal repair beat, tilting toward competence without raw struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from mechanical fix to linguistic vigil; orientation anchors in first paragraph (tower, weight, librarian). On-page RR closure in "grain elevator groaned, then sang" with felt exhaustion cost and reconfigured harmony, persistent constraint of time before dawn shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting integrates purposefully: language drawers supply resources for interspersing, speaking tube constrains distant dialogue, balcony enables vigil; POV-biased details like "languages stored in labeled drawers" charge final equilibrium image. Recurrent tower constrains choices throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rehabilitate tower-elevator link) signaled early, tightens via elevator's demand ("Build me a bridge") forcing linguistic escalation under Accumulative lens. Agency in weaving languages forecloses silence with exhaustion cost legible in descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of porous mechanical-human boundaries emerges organically from particulars like interwoven languages and harmonized chime; final image of "roadway of resonance no silo could contain" reweights silos-as-islands premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity on custodianship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in choral metaphors ("descending scale that matched her alto"); rhythmic control modulates from hush to vigorous hymn, purposeful lyric compression taught early. Elevator dialogue gritty/subtextual, distinct from her voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "chain sang a descending scale that matched her alto"; varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors during vigil ("violins made of augers") risks coherence in peak beat but pattern-taught lyric mode mitigates.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of choral linguistics mending mechanical voices transforms tropes into inevitable "bread can remember the music," with bold lyric risk heightening resonance; irreplaceable premise commits fully to porous boundaries.</comment>
