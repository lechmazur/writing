<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Poet's motivation rooted in consistent poetic attentiveness intensifies through micro-choices like fixing the zither string, earning the final endurance of incompleteness; woman's chipped tooth and laugh reveal character-particular flaws without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of fragments building to spiral's dissolution as Charged Poise CR, with cost legible in "the erasure, too, became part of the woven dawns"; orientation anchored immediately in shoreline lagoon.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tideline shards and cobalt lagoon constrain choices (pressing feather into sand, walking spiral) and charge final erasure image; sensory selection (salt/iron taste, buzz of string) reflects poetic POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of beauty in incomplete signaled early, tightens accumulatively via woman's zither catalyzing joint weaving then tide's dissolution; cost felt in foreclosed completion, charging "sufficient" poem.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of incomplete beauty emerges implicitly from particulars like torn feather and chipped tooth, reweighted in final "door left ajar" without moralizing; resonant answer to horizon's wound via woven dawns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature ("burnished hush," "loom of almost") modulates rhythm with intensity; single POV stable, no head-hopping, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in lines like "Morning is a torn net that still holds fish"; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("gyre," "mirrors") during peak weaving slightly dulls but pattern pays off.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lyric fragments into collaborative poem transforms shoreline trope; risk in zither-fishing line hybrid heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via feather's arc.</comment>
