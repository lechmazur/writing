<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's habits (tooth to lips) and micro-choices (climbing boulder) reveal particular motives under pressure, earning the soul integration; minor slip in unshown internal contradiction caps below 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure (giggle absorbed, gorge exhales) and legible cost (tooth dissolves into salt water); orientation anchored early at gorge lip.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Gorge and harp constrain choices (pursuit downstream, string contact) and charge final image (footprints glowing); sensory details (sour chords, luminous ache) integrate purposefully through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch giggle splinter) tightens accumulatively via harp lure and tooth intervention, forcing trade-off with legible cost (string snaps, dissolution); enters 8+ via foreclosed pursuit option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of healing fractures emerges organically through particulars (warped lullaby, giggle's reflection); final image (laughter as small sun behind ribs) offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (memories bent into shapes) and rhythmic modulation; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but figurative density in climax beat ("luminous ache...colors no tongue could name") borders overwriting without muddle, docking from 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of soul-collecting as laughter splinters transforms tropes via specific world logic (echoes as confessions); risk-taking in lyric fantasy heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
