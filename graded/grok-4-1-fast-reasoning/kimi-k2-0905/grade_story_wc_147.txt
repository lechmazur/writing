<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority shines in embodied contradictions like knees bruised by guilt yet kicking deeper, compelling the vial sacrifice with clear cost to her last Earth anchor. Contradictory impulses act in scene (flee vs. override), earning the closure renunciation. No diagnostic labels; flaws like guilt drive inevitable deepening into the sanctuary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hush density builds to organ's inhale of scented signal, yielding Resonant Reconfiguration as reply flickers and temple broadcasts. Orientation anchors early ("flooded nave," Mira as cartographer); cost legible in emptied vial and burning lungs at "lonesome splendor" poise. Single scene, no shards, closure charged without micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Coral-grown organ and stone tendrils constrain choices (clog pipes, wrap mast), charging final vial offering image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis to lilac sphere, silt, thunder chord; POV bias filters via cartographer's mapping lens. Details evolve causally (pipes shudder, murals brighten), mirroring internal hush-to-resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (signal before air shrinks) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative deepening: tendrils tighten to organ override, narrowing options with vial trade-off agency. Cost unmistakable in "wasted her last anchor" fear resolved by resonance, reweighting to Charged Poise. Moral calculus in ephemeral harness vs. temple solitude sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of solitude-to-signal emerges organically from hush recoiling to lilac aria, reweighting "forgotten only until remembered out loud" without moralizing. Final image (bubbles like lilac blossoms, vial offering) resonates non-literally, embracing ambiguity in temple's perpetual broadcast. Particulars like whale-riders tie arc inseparably.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: cartographer notices "cracked lapis tiles," "peeled murals" biased to mapping resonance. Voice modulates rhythmically under stress (short "lungs burning" bursts amid lyric swells); purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at closure. No head-hopping, diction fits lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels: "lilac drop drifted out, spherical and luminous" does image/action/foreshadowing sans loops. Rhythms vary (slowmotion thunder vs. thin kelp laugh), metaphors cohere (hush as snow muffles). Minor figurative density in climax ("memories scattering like startled glassfish") purposeful, no scaffold or template cadence dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: scent-to-frequency overrides temple's hush instinct, transforming underwater trope via lilac's irreplaceable ephemeral charge. Risky lyric risks heighten stakes (perfumed proof builds hope), inevitable in hindsight from vial setup. No derivative echoes; bold conceit commits fully.</comment>
