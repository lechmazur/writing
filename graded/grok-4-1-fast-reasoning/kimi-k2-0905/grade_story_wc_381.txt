<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses culminate in earned endurance at swallowing the sphere, with visible cost of internal rotation; cracked smile reveals solitary flaw without hedging. Final choice forecloses unburdened wandering, rooted in prior master's cracking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-taught hush building to Charged Poise closure; drumbeat intrusion tightens density before inverse word "." reconfigures prophecy into carried weight, cost legible in "accepted the weight... murmurs against the bone." Orientation anchored early by brook ritual; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Brook and body constrain choices (wading grips ankles, water carries syllables) and charge final image (polishing prophecy into pebbles); moonlight ripples and reeds selectively mirror hush-building without catalog. Micro-setting (sternum heat, throat sphere) tethers cosmic to terrestrial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to hush code escalates via textural intrusion (drumbeat in crickets, copper taste) forcing agency (lifting galaxy, speaking "."); one decisive deepening narrows to swallow with unmistakable internal cost, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of tranquility as mastered blaze emerges implicitly via shifting images (tranquil blaze from menace to color birth); final smile and released crane offer resonant non-literal repricing without moralizing, reweighting prior prophecy threat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature ("terrestrially cosmic," hush mappings); rhythmic modulation peaks in sparse "." utterance, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at dawn release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but figurative stacking in climax ("galaxy made of absences... mouth of anti-sound") borders coherence strain, docking for overwrought pressure beat without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami hush-ritual against coded prophecy transforms summoning tropes into inevitable lyric arc; risk-taking in silence-mapping and "." as spoken period heightens stakes organically.</comment>
