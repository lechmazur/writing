<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's thumbnail healed by moonbeam backstory concretely roots motivation in discovery; contradictory apology to astronomer's dream and recitation of personal linden-planting year earn closure renunciation of quantification with visible cost in notebook instructions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density through dream-mapping to pin-drop trigger; closure as resonant reconfiguration lands on-page when sextant transmutes to cedar, reweighting sorrow with conceptual cost in "numbered leaves trembling with residual grief."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tower parapet constrains chalk-grid mapping on slick stone; moonlight poured through sextant cracks rings it with spectral trees, charging final cedar image rooted there.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to release quantified sorrow tightens via pin-drop alignment and dream-mapping lowering milligrams; agency in deconstruction pays visible cost of recited drought/fire/memory rings, transmuting brass to wood.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Spectral trees reveal stored sums of human calculations; cedar's growth into ordinary time with cones as "tiny sextants offering second chances" resonantly reweights premise without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature fuses tactile (wet prints vanish) and lyric ("shadow became a second tower upside-down, rooted in clouds"); rhythmic hush ("storm withdrew to a hush; even the wind held its breath") heightens pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax from stormlit climb to dawn; metaphors cohere around trees/rings/mercury ("brass limbs twisted like a dead spider," "bead of mercury") without muddle or loops in climax deconstruction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sextant measuring tree grief snaps under burden, deconstructed via dream-grid into cedar releasing numbered bark – bold, inevitable synthesis transforms quantification trope with risk-taking payoff in residual leaf-grief.</comment>
