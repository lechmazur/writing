<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particularized through embodied readings of teacup crack as "miniature sunrise," harmonica ghost note, and Carina scar; motivation roots in glazier craft and dreams, earning reconfiguration without epiphanic overreach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds from prism placement through ring readings to hurled prism's arc healing town windows, landing CR where "prism atrium in mist dissolved" reweights mundane value with conceptual cost before sunrise ledger closes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pearl Bay dawn sensory hierarchy (salt wind/kelp/rust, drip striking "black mirror") filters via glazier bias, constraining ritual at water's edge; pond rings and pier post evolve to charge final light blades into town.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to illuminate mundane tightens accumulatively via spectral lattice on ripples revealing relics, culminating in hurled prism foreclosing neglect with on-page radiance spreading to cracked skylight/greenhouse/clock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mundane relics ("chipped teacup," dented harmonica, blood scar) rise luminous where "spectral violet met water," offering non-literal repricing of beauty debts without moralizing; final dissolution integrates arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with glazier perceptual signature ("storms slid off them like apologies," "dark syllable") stable in single POV, modulating rhythm from hush to gull riot without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density in ring projections ("concentric rings expanded, each a dark syllable") propels without loops or muddled metaphors; varied syntax breathes with ritual cadence to "ledger balanced."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glazier reading ripple ledger for noctilucent debts transforms mundane illumination premise organically, with prism hurl as fresh inflection risking lyric ritual that charges closure inevitably.</comment>
