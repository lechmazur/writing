<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Concrete interiority in ink-squirming touch and shard-handling reveals grief-rooted motives; micro-choices like kneeling to circle shards compel descent. Rhetorical questions show contradictory impulses but border diagnostic phrasing mid-crisis, slightly unearned at mirror.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density-tightening (walls contract, stairs spiral down); orientation anchored in first paragraph. CR closure via self-portrait door-stepping reconfigures fragments into truer fracture with drowning cost legible in "salt sealed his eyes."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (mildewed breath, rusted hinges) reflects urgency; lighthouse constrains choices (contracting corridors force descent) and charges final spiral mirror. Micro-setting of warped quadrant and collapsing globe grounds surrealism without white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repaint lost face) signaled early, deepens via redesign under textural lens with narrowing options (lighthouse collapse). Agency in shard-untangling forecloses return path; cost unmistakable in "stepped through" to endless descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented art/memory emerges organically from shard-reassembly and mirror-transfer; final villagers' question offers non-literal resonant answer via waves' painting/unpainting. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "truer fracture."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (coastline metaphors for memory); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in descent. Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm accelerates descent; no major loops but "questions rhetorical questions" repetition dulls slightly without obscuring cause/effect. Figurative density coherent (lunar wax drip), propels without scaffold in peak shard-touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms artist-grief trope via tarot-lighthouse surrealism; bold risk in endless-spiral self-portrait heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight in shards-to-door reconfiguration feels non-obvious.</comment>
