<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (anger rising but breathed down) act simultaneously during the graft; final salute earns renunciation of shame with embodied cost in scar-tap and steady hands. Interiority particular via fire-specific perceptions like "embers had kissed her." Flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memories and images tightens to Charged Poise closure in the salute and promise, reconfiguring shame into harmonizing song with conceptual cost legible in "next year... saplings instead of sand." Orientation anchored early; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lagoon water poured into trench constrains graft and charges final "cool salt tide" image mirroring internal reconfiguration. Sensory selection (hiss, shiver, glint) filtered through firefighter bias; dunes and pines evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove scars sing) signaled early, textural escalation via memory density forces endurance choice at planting despite flinch; cost unmistakable in foreclosed anger path and "harmonize" reconfiguration. Agency in micro-choices like tying coin narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of scars' song emerges organically from graft particulars; final coin-glint image resonantly reweights Icarus myth without moralizing, inviting ambiguity in "someone still stands watch." No tidy resolution, complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in fire-kelp-firefighter diction (e.g., "sprinkler heads in a burning hallway"); rhythmic modulation builds to charged closure without head-hopping or withholding. Lyrical compression taught early, legible payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image-charged sentences; minor figurative density coherent in fire motif without muddle at closure. No loops or scaffolds dull propulsion; read-aloud cadence supports textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arson daughter planting father's shame transforms tropes via specific graft/coin; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from opening alert poise to final salute.</comment>
