<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular via illustrator's afterimages of "negative space between her mother’s last breath and the final heartbeat"; contradictory impulses in borrowing vs. repaying time earn the closure choice of touching the echo with visible future-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from reversing ripples to aviary echoes; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page when "echoes burst outward" and "time snapped taut," cost legible in "tiny boats of digits that sailed away, carrying her unspent future."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rooftop canals constrain via upstream gunnel walk and forked spirals; recurring water evolves (reverses, then obeys gravity) to charge final dawn image, filtered through illustrator's eye without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find echoes' birthplace) tightens accumulatively via accruing time debt, narrowing to aviary price; agency in cadence breaths and pendant offering forecloses future with legible cost in numeral boats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time-debts paid by memory-choice emerges implicitly from cadence patterns and echoes; final image of sealed pendant and doorway illustration reweights interruptions non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in visual/musical notices ("ripples climbing backward like silverfish," "steam rose in shapes of musical notation"); rhythmic control modulates to charged poise at "Time snapped taut."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative consistency (cadence/time motifs taught early); minor metaphor density in middle yields to clear propulsion at closure aviary without loops or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musical time-bending in giant-nap canals transforms tropes via aviary of "audible memories"; risk-taking in lyric accumulation inevitable to doorway reconfiguration.</comment>
