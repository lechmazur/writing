<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via childhood memory cueing dismantle choice; final dissolution earned by prior suppression backstory anchored to present frost and light. Interiority concrete and particular in "migraine of unborn constellations."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of aurora/stars/metaphors tightens to dismantle as pattern break; RR/CR closure in "body dissolving into the traced path" with conceptual cost of erasure legible in final glass circle image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tundra instrument and aurora constrain dismantle choice and charge final circle; selective sensory (tremor, squeak, frost) reflects urgency, integrated into action like "loosened the clamps."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free creativity or soul colorblind) signaled early, deepens via "create or perish" syllables narrowing to self-sacrifice agency; cost unmistakable in dissolution under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from stardust motifs shifting to collective invitation; final "create, or perish, or create again" reweights prior wounds without moralizing, resonant via glass circle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in star-as-Braille noticing; stable third-limited POV with rhythmic modulation peaks in "ribboning through the open skeleton," no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (light threading skeleton); minor figurative density in peak aurora descent but pays off without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telescope-as-self-orrery transforms dreamer trope; dissolution risk heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early syllables.</comment>
