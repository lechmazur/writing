<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional: contradictory refusal of grief pairs with embodied memory sacrifice at nib dip, earning final equation balance with visible cost; Rurik's pressure forces her micro-choice, flaws (honest payment) complicate and resolve organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds impeccably from active wait to door click (inciting) through ink breach (climax) to pot cracking (DC closure) with legible memory cost in final image; single scene oriented by para 1, no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (formaldehyde/lilacs lurch, ink's iron/thunder) constrains via prep room privacy/tools, bone saw/ink pot charge final trade; flickering lights mirror breach, corpse as silent pressure on pivotal deal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fair trade emerges implicitly via liquefying motifs shifting from policies to convictions, final "equation balanced" reweights premise without moralizing; memory cost as conceptual price lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (pacing rehearses equation); dialogue subtext-rich ("Trade requires disclosure"), rhythmic diction modulates tension without drift; minor elevated register fits literary voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel through peak breach without loops; purposeful liquefy motif unifies figurative layer despite density in ink moment, no scaffold obscures closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic ink con in funeral desecration transforms asylum trope via math-trade calculus; ink solidification as inevitable risk heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
