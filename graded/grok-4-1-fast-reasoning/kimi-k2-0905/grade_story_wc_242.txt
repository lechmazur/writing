<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Operator's cultivated estrangement yields contradictory impulses—staying vs. stepping beyond—embodied in the choice to hand over the disc yet return, earned by prior calls; final departure forecloses isolation with job cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density (loops, disc song) tightening to CR/RR closure; cost legible as "clipped the copper wires, shut the logbook" abandons duty for direction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Disc as micro-setting constrains gate-opening and charges handover; tunnel/grate evoke damp isolation mirroring estrangement without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to break loop escalates via call accumulation to invitation's deepening, forcing disc handover/renunciation; protagonist agency crystallizes stance with booth forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loops-into-lines emerges via disc/rail images, resonant in final "without destination, only direction" reweighting estrangement sans moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature ("orchids... in darkness") modulates rhythm with pressure; dialogue subtextual ("Teach me how endings begin") advances organically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("disc rang a three-note chord that tasted like rusted rain"); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass harmonica disc transforms isolation trope into humming portal; risk-taking lyric accumulation of haunted motifs yields inevitable CR without gimmickry.</comment>
