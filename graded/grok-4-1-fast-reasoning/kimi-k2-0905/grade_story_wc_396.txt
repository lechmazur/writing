<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Mara feeding restrained sorrow to the shard against training, compelling the swallow of empathy with embodied terror; final revocation earned by prior suppression-cost buildup. Voice-specific traits like emotional residue sight drive micro-choices without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: shard study → mirror visions → harbor step-through → Keeper confrontation → reconstitution, with legible cost in trapped reflection and floe deadline. Closure as Decisive Change lands cleanly on sphere-hanging, rethickening border.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard mirrors constrain choice by framing visions and enabling doorway; ice floes pressure timeframe, charging final solid-lock image. Sensory details (salt-to-apple shift) filter through Mara's residue-sight bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstitute before dawn) tightens via agency-driven deepening: shard-feeding narrows to swallowing surplus empathy, forcing confrontation with cost in "terrifying and bright" flood. Causal escalation forecloses detachment path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Empathy-vs-detachment theme emerges organically from crate-swallow and Keeper's weighted fall; final sphere-drip reconfigures cycle without statement, lingering via orchard's apple-taste shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in residue/emotion glimpses; rhythmic prose modulates from calm breath-matching to rushed "colliding birds," heightening pressure without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates metaphors (gulls, tears) purposefully across beats; no loops, propulsion peaks in harbor confrontation with varied syntax, clear cause-effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-market and empathy-crates transforms lighthouse trope; risk in poetic compression pays off via inevitable shard-sphere arc, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
