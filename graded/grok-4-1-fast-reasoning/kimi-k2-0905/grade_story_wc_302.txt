<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in stolen voice intensifies via embodied mouth sewn shut, compelling final un-sewing with dissolution cost; contradictory impulses shift from cautious to fierce in prophecy realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as cipher fragments build density to CR closure: "THE LIBRARY IS THE WORD, AND YOU ARE ITS TONGUE" reconfigures premise; cost legible in body dissolving into wing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Library's hungry atmosphere dissolves paper, forcing memory palace; phosphorescent tiles and bleeding silk shelves constrain navigation and charge absorption into "shelves rearranging into the shape of her open mouth."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to reclaim voice tightens accumulatively as watch ballast pulls to inverting heart; agency in removing thread screams backward, foreclosing self with legible price in eternal wing-form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Unspoken words as living entity emerges implicitly via books as swallowed moments; final letter "Thank you for speaking us. Now we exist" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting silence-into-existence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single veiled-dreamer POV with perceptual signature: mist-traced symbols and library breathing under veil-lift; rhythmic diction modulates pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (propagation delays) taught early; minor paraphrase loop in "documented" beats slightly dulls mid-section propulsion without harming closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Bold synthesis of living unsaid library and backward-echoing scream transforms voice-theft trope; inevitable hindsight from cipher to becoming tongue heightens conceptual stakes.</comment>
