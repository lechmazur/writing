<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character motivation rooted in obsession with mapping oblivion drives consistent micro-choices like noting thunder's shape; interiority embodied through pulse matching the star and toes gripping stone. Internal conflict subtle but present in negotiating extension with dying star. Earned change in becoming the map's first coordinate, with cost of self-dissolution legible; minor abstraction in epiphanic backstory slightly tempers perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as symbolic mapping builds density toward CR closure: oracle steps into outline as fort dissolves into rumor, with conceptual cost of becoming absence's orbit legible in "she became the first coordinate." Orientation anchored early (parapet, last star). Single tightening via hush clotting wrists narrows to final stroke; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (salt-slick stone, iron-taste wind) filtered through oracle's perceptual bias toward absences; fort constrains via groaning stones and shifting ridge, evolving to dissolution that charges final image. Micro-setting (booklet, quill splinter) guides choices. Star as recurring object tightens perception, mirroring internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete map before star expires) signaled early, accumulates texturally via deepening hush and bleeding ink; agency in summarizing symbols forecloses paths with felt cost (hush clotting wrists forces final stroke). One tightening reweights options; minor abstractness in stakes keeps below 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of absence mapped into endurance emerges organically from particulars like pebble-eyes backstory shifting to absences; final image ("still point around which absence could finally orbit") offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing. Subtext in recursive doors and doorless doorway invites ambiguity; no tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: biased toward silences ("spiral for the pause inside every heartbeat"). Voice modulates rhythmically with pressure, compressing in peak (hush thickening); purposeful poetic elision taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density in lines like "an angled bracket for the moment before thunder"; figurative language patterned for lyric mode without muddle. Minor overwriting in metaphor density during mapping beats dulls propulsion slightly ("marbled hush" paraphrase near end); no loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartographing oblivion transforms mystic trope via specific symbols (jagged parenthesis) and CR payoff; risk in dissolving reality heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; premise commits to endless night logic without retreat, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
