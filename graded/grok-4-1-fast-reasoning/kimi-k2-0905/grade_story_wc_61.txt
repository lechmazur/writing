<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's sentimentalism drives concrete micro-choices like tuning the gear and kneeling at the beacon, embodying contradiction between rooted exile and forwarding ping with sealed heart-crack as earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sonar echoes densify to sharp signal and gear-beacon union, delivering Resonant Reconfiguration where ratio resolves into rhythm, costing the gear's abandonment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nebula garden's pollen-sinking paths and parting petals constrain stepping off and reveal beacon, charging final glowing blossoms that mirror internal release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to break cycle escalates accumulatively from nostalgic aches to blurred vibration, agency in pressing gear foreclosing sorrow-path with legible seal of destined fracture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Generational patterns reweighted by gear-rhythm marrying loss to invitation, final spirals answering rooted prophecy non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("quiet sigh of falling petals," "hair's-breadth crack") biases toward resonance, stable single-POV modulating rhythmically to infinity-blur at peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from slow petals to suspended pause, zero loops or muddled figures; climax's "teeth blurred, approximating infinity in motion" flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Infinity-gear and sonar-through-gas synthesize exile into flameless waveform, risking lyric sci-fi for inevitable spiral-transmission that transforms tropes.</comment>
