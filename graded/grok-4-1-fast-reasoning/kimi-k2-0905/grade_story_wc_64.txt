<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mercy's interiority shines in embodied echoes fluttering through ribs and trembling fingers during decoding, rooting motivation in grandmother's songs; final keeper role earned via micro-choices like pressing coin, with contradictory blitheness vs. deepening pull foreclosing ordinary life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as coin pulses to tapestry decoding to map-guided dig, yielding CR closure in root cellar sealing with conceptual cost of surface world foreclosure; orientation anchors early via cemetery/gardener, one tightening via drawer reveal suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt silo constrains via ladder climb and locking door, charging final image; marble lamb enables dig at feet; selective sensory details like starlight-dripping skylight and preserved apples integrate purposefully, mirroring internal shifts without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to discover intentions signaled early, tightens accumulatively through decoding reversal narrowing to family plot spiral, agency in spadework/descent; cost legible in silo's metallic kiss sealing her, crystallizing stance under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory outwager-ing oblivion emerges via spiral/tapestry particulars shifting to "intentions: hope, defiance, return"; final image of infinite chess clock offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in geometric echoes and tenderly organized paths; rhythmic prose modulates from humming calm to pulsing urgency, compression taught early as poetic texture paying off in charged cellar descent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "starlight drips through the skylight onto a forgotten tapestry"; figurative consistency (spirals, threads) purposeful without muddle or loops, though minor density of metaphors in decoding slightly slows propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cemetery secrets via ciphered tapestry and missile-silo root cellar transforms memory tropes; risky velveteen lyricism heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from coin's wink to seed-packet charge.</comment>
