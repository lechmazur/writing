<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in bucking pulse against calm eyes at first vision; final gift earned by prior mirror successes and mission root. Backstory trade anchors present choice without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via mirror visions building density to third refusal/choice; RR closure at sphere gift with legible cost ("without compass or currency") felt in weighed risk line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prism parapet bookends with raindrop slide and citizen touch, constraining palette placement and charging final spectrum vision. Sensory hierarchy painterly, e.g., lilac smell in second mirror.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled in spire-climbing mission; meaningful tightening at third mirror's full-surrender demand forces song/gift agency under lens, foreclosing solo path with on-page risk legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of possibilities vs. flat truth emerges via shifting mirror images; final hundreds-touching terrace reconfigures premise non-literally, reweighting without moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct painterly perceptual signature in color pigments and glass prophets; rhythmic modulation tightens at "flutter like a moth" under stress, stable close third-person.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like bell notes carrying pigments; purposeful figurative pattern taught early avoids muddle, though minor "perceptively calm" repetition nudges down slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of heartbeat-bait magic and coded lullabies transforms mirror trope organically; risk in lyric fantasy heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at gifted-sphere closure.</comment>
