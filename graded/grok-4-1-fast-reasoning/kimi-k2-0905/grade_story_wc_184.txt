<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to translate absence is rooted in consistent traits like reading contours of gaps, shown concretely in braiding the village shape. Interiority particular via "sailors read wind by watching waves," with micro-choices under pressure aligning actions to task. No strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal braiding moment limits 9+; competence dominates without much blind-spot struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry to braiding, pattern break in letters rising/sinking, closure as CR when clock folds village between ticks with conceptual cost of preserved absence vs. erasure. Single continuous scene, orientation anchored early ("3:17 a.m., spiral stair"), causal progression via seal to rope. Final image discrepancy ("struck four, though her watch insisted... three") reconfigures time indelibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: "air tasted of rust and rain," gears "taller than confessionals" constrain climb/platform access, rope/chest as micro-setting enable pivotal braiding. Perception POV-biased to absences ("hollow tooth in chronology"). Oak beams, pendulum heartbeat charge final tick-containing-village image, evolving with flakes of "oxidized time."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (merge fables when hands freeze) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via shivering gears and wax bleeding to letters, narrowing to braid village with agency/cost in reconfiguration. One tightening sufficient: frozen hands lurch forward, folding time forecloses erasure path. Cost felt in safe containment "where memory is safe from historians."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of absence translated emerges organically from particulars: seal's swans, erased village via rope braids, resonant CR in "tucking the village into... between ticks." Final catalog entry ("absence, translated; location: between seconds") non-literal answer reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in unnoticed braid leaving graduates "oddly full" invites lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: notices "contour" absences, biases toward catalogs/ledgers. Distinct poetic texture in syntax/rhythm ("heartbeat felt like a question"), modulates with ritual intensity. No head-hopping or withholding; compression purposeful, taught early via maps/rumors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short punchy sentences in braiding: "each twist a syllable"), high density in peak ("Letters rose... sank back"). Heavy figurative in climax ("bleeding wax," "tiny red sun," "hollow tooth") risks overwriting (−0.4), but consistent voice-motivated lyricism avoids muddle; no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: absence as braidable village in clock-tower ritual transforms magical-archival tropes organically. Risky poetic conceit ("oxidized time" flakes, rope lassoing moon legend) heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in warmed rope/graduates' fullness. Non-obvious premise of time folding memory feels singular.</comment>
