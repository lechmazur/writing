<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in choosing ghost-echo paths amid fractures, earning the climactic smash that erases elder-Kael with visible self-cost; childhood room cue anchors reflection without flattening pressure. Interiority particular via temporal papercuts leaking hours.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds from procedural paths to fractures, tightening via tablet hiccup into the decisive smash—CR closure with erasure cost legible in "timelines collapsed inward... soft sigh of a book closing."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Viaduct's glowing algae and upward rain constrain choices (arches fork, rail enables smash), charging final ordinary viaduct image; sensory hierarchy (copper-ozone air, sideways droplets slicing) filters through gravity-defier's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-labyrinth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through echo-choices and elder confrontation, narrowing to agency-driven smash with erasure cost that reconfigures selves under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of self-erasure emerges organically via timeline fractures and minotaur-as-choices, resonant CR in ripple-doorway reweighting premise without moralizing; final boy-clocks image answers labyrinth question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (physics inverted, runes computing bedrooms) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from procedural calm to fracture urgency, elder's whisper subtext-charged without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "rainwater bead and fall upward" anchors voice); metaphors consistent without muddle, varied rhythm survives read-aloud; no loops, minor density risks offset by closure payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of gravity defiance, periodic eternity, and self-labyrinth feels inevitable, transforming time-tropes via procedural ghosts and rune-birds; bold lyric risks heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
