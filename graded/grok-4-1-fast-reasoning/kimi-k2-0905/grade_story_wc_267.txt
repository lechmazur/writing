<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied contradictions like "frostbitten hope crystallizing on his lashes" and micro-choices under pressure, such as pressing the bolt into the boy's palm; final endurance as sentinel earned by backstory anchors and motivation to grasp silence's cost, satisfying 9+ test without unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise/CR closure in "microscopic fracture in its century-old silence" and final image of inherited bolt/role; on-page cost legible in boy's whitening knuckles and erased footprints, with orientation anchored early in staircase climb.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (metal taste, nerve whine, meltwater constellations) constrains choices like tracing discoloration and charges final image; recurring cobalt/snow mirrors internal states purposefully without overt symbolism, satisfying 9+ test via staircase/bolt as micro-settings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of voicing silence's cost escalates accumulatively via steeper stairs, dimmer mark, boy's gaze, and surgeon's headshake, forcing endurance agency; cost unmistakable in "one voice subtracted, one fortress preserved" and collective breathing, driven by protagonist's remaining.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of safety's voice-cost emerges organically from particulars like bolt/lullaby tension and ledger gaze, culminating in resonant CR via "fortress to decide whether safety was worth the price"; non-literal final image reweights premise without moralizing, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "air tasted of metal and old songs") stable in single POV, modulating rhythm under pressure; purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged poise, satisfying 9+ test with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and coherent metaphors (snowfall robes, iron memory) propel without loops or scaffolds; peak beats like final stitch/breathing retain clarity and propulsion, satisfying 9+ test; minor poetic density elevates without overwriting coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silent fortress inheritance and seraphic bolt transforms tropes via lived lyricism; risk-taking in accumulative CR heightens stakes in "loosen the bolt... a single note struck," feeling inevitable and irreplaceable.</comment>
