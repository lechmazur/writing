<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Advisor's motivation to translate silence into music roots actions consistently and intensifies via accumulative deletions, revealed through signing under moonlight; lacks on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but mythic archetype suits scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mapping subtracts noise in rising density to RR closure at final chord ("harbor exhaled a note"), with conceptual cost legible in lingering decay and advisor's dissolution; orientation anchored early in harbor; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harbor's luminous details (silver ladders, salt-kissed phosphor) constrain signing visibility and charge final water-sheet-music image; sensory hierarchy reflects advisor's fog/rust/taste priorities woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence-to-music) signaled early escalates via textural density of subtractions forcing town realizations, agency in counterclockwise mapping culminates in chord with felt transience cost; coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mapped silence as latent music emerges organically from particulars like afterglow trails and exhaled note, resonant CR in final camera-offering reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature (silence mapped as coastlines/fog shapes) with rhythmic modulation peaks at symphony; stable third-person distance suits lyric mode, no head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm (short punches in deletions, long swells at chord); figurative coherence (phosphor trails, turbines of grief) taught early pays off without muddle or loops in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empty camera, sailor sign language, silence-mapping transforms mythic disruption trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight at capstan-camera reprise.</comment>
