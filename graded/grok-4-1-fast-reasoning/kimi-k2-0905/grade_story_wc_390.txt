<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and sonic-specific ("micro-shrieks only she could detect"); contradictory impulses peak in "logically emotional calculus" driving third-path choice with embodied cost (tears tasting salt/iron). Final endurance earned via prior micro-choices like tempo sync. No flaws touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of resonances builds to Charged Poise closure in final pier-sitting image with worn key as cost. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (Mireya on pier at sunset). Single scene coherent; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains climax (calving slabs force pattern weave); sensory hierarchy sonic/embodied (ice chord up arm). Final stars-as-spiral charges image, mirroring Echo. Micro-setting (pier, key) alters tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect Echo) signaled early, tightens via ice-memory sync narrowing to third path under Accumulative lens. Agency in bowing/driver yields visible cost (key teeth worn smooth). Shadows' approach escalates without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mercy-through-listening emerges via whale-song frequency inviting shadows; final whisper reweights "protect by teaching darkness to listen" without statement. Stars-spiral image resonant, non-literal answer with conceptual cost (ongoing keeper role).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with sonic perceptual signature ("pier hum like organ pipes"); rhythmic modulation peaks in climax without drift. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with sonic metaphors taught early/purposeful, but figurative saturation in climax ("warm blood, fleshly ethereal") borders overwriting without muddle (-0.3). No loops/artifacts; propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Whale-bone Echo/vibrational calculus fresh synthesis; shadows-as-townsfolk softened by frequency transforms tropes organically. Risky "logically emotional" lens heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
