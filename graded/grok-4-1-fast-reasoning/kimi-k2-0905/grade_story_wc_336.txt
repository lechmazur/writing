<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arin's motivation to preserve wonder intensifies through concrete actions like building the loom and tasting the seed; internal conflict peaks in the realization to release rather than hoard, earning the final flinging of droplets with personal cost of aging lighter. Contradictory impulses act in scene as he captures then shares. Idealized but fable-consistent traits shown through creative pruning and singing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from loom-weaving to color-swirling, tightening at "weave tugged back" into CR closure where Arin flings droplets, loom collapses (felt cost), reconfiguring preservation as sharing. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph. Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: mist's reach constrains loom placement, waterfall veil widens into door shaping climax choice; moss flames and stone sings under anointed eyelid, charging final image. POV-biased details mirror wonder's return. No white-room; purposeful economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via color gathering then buckling pull, forcing agency in release; cost legible in loom's collapse and city's responsive laughter. One tightening forecloses hoarding option under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sharing to preserve emerges organically from particulars like droplets bursting into fireworks; final sapling image resonantly reweights premise without moral, lingering ambiguity in dream-roots. No sermonizing; charged by events.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: pattern-seeing in "water’s veil shimmered like a loom"; rhythmic modulation from hushed dawn to torrential laughter. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (weaving/color motifs) taught early, no muddle or loops in peak beats like snipping air; rhythm varies, propulsion clear to "sapling remains" image. Minor overwriting offset by voice coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fable tropes via living loom capturing intangible wonder, grafting twig to air as bold reconfiguration; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
