<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied interiority peaks in "turbines bud in her marrow, clockwork unfurl behind her eyes," revealing contradictory helix impulses during calibration with visible motor risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to Charged Poise closure: engines clatter to dust yet pockets sag with sketches, reconfiguring pursuit with blood and quaking cost on the final ascent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Canyon walls and periscope mirror constrain climax calibration—"if the angle was off by a milliradian"—guiding choices and charging moon-shear failure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of intact extraction tightens via moon-slide "shearing away from the mirror’s fracture," forcing partial overwrite with legible physical/emotional price in blood-threaded retreat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final "pockets sagged with sketches" and "new seams of quartz" offer resonant answer to dream archaeology, reweighting helix hunger without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Helix perceptual signature—"chaotically precise déjà vu"—holds under stress in memory-twist beat, with rhythmic modulation enhancing immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels but opening canyon description carries slight figurative overload ("broken periscope mirror abandoned by some giant"); peak helmet interface clean and varied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synthesis of quantum dream-veins and neurotrophin helmet yields inevitable partial resurrection, risking gimmick but grounded in synaptic specifics.</comment>
