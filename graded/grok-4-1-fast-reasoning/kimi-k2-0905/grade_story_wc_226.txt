<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when reciting shifts to hearing echoes of past refusals, earning closure acceptance with embodied cost in ribs and forehead press; defiance roots micro-choices like apricot-stealing tone without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as syllable ribbons multiply into chordal mist-shapes, cadence-shifting to spire's "seam of light opening like an eye" for CR with feather's sufficient weightlessness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mirror shard and vertebrae holds constrain climbing/angling tactics; mist swirls regrets mirroring internal weight, charging fissure; sensory selectivity (warm spire vs dawn chill) biases through defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ritual-hour stake deepens accumulatively via unrelieved echo-weight to listening renunciation; agency crystallizes in "I accept the cost," foreclosing deflection with doubled shadow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prism-truth scatters blame into shared chord, reweighting refusal via feather-bridge painting; resonant without moral, counter-readings linger in softer hum vs regret's sharpness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distorts echoes into pleas/ghost sentences; rhythm modulates from mischievous improvisation to held-breath hush, stable close-third under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds, high density propels via varied rhythm; coherent metaphors peak cleanly in "bone vibrating like a plucked wire" without overwriting closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Echo-prism transforms exile/ritual tropes into truth-refracting art; bold hush-to-hum risk heightens stakes, inevitable in blood-dipped feather synthesis.</comment>
