<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between reckoning and compassion act vividly in shedding sequence and plaque-making, earning release of Aster as renunciation with cost to pride; interiority concrete and embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of shedding and reconstruction builds to Charged Poise closure in final release image, with legible cost ("poorer in pride and richer in doubt"); orientation anchored in opening line, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cedar table, refrigerated drawer, stove, and plaque constrain choices and charge final image over door; sensory details (mist, moonlight, pulsing throat) selective and POV-filtered, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconstructing creed tightens accumulatively through shedding to plaque to release, forcing trade-off (expertise vs. doubt) with agency in micro-choices; cost legible in abandoned cage and balanced convictions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cracked convictions emerges organically from tail-tip plaque and Aster's departure, final image reweighting premise without moralizing; resonance from particulars like bone vows avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature (animal scales, mist as emotion); lyrical rhythm modulates effectively, compression purposeful and legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic variety propel, but figurative density ("tiny paintbrush dipped in moonlight," "orange tongues licked") risks overwriting in reflective beats without pattern payoff; no loops, clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tail-tip vertebrae as vow-plaque transforms redemption trope ingeniously, synthesizing shedding motif with wildlife handling into fresh, inevitable closure; bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
