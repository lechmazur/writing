<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Mira's scientific control clashing with visceral transformation, embodied in "roots pushing through compacted earth"; final surrender earned via prior causal buildup of denial, with clear cost in lost humanity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to CR closure in "consciousness scatter like spores," reweighting control premise with undeniable conceptual cost; leaf-to-wrist contact provides one decisive tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse environment constrains via trellis catching fall and floor rooting legs, charging final nursery image; sensory details like pulsing veins mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of control vs. nature tightens via leaf-sync pulse narrowing options to surrender; agency in release forecloses human path with legible cost in slowed heartbeat, under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of surrender emerges organically from vein-storm patterns to lindens' face imprints, offering non-literal resonant answer that reweights prior denial without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical botanical perceptual signature consistent, e.g., "wind through hollow bamboo" laugh; stable close third-person limited with no head-hopping, modulating rhythm under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via integrated images like "fiber optics" veins; minor figurative density in transformation beat purposeful but borders overwriting, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical science and metamorphosis via silver-vein storm sync feels inevitable; risk in hybrid plant-architecture nursery elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
