<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation as ocean-spray archivist intensifies through micro-choices like showing the valve and bargaining with an empty satchel, earning the closure blow with embodied fear and forgiveness; contradictory impulses (doubt vs. duty) act in scene without tidy resolution. Interiority particular via fragment metaphors tied to actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of absences building to Charged Poise closure: final trumpet folds silence into resonance with felt cost in "fear and forgiveness"; orientation anchored in opening harbor image, pattern taught early via staggered intervals pays off without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivory harbor's wet hemp, ozone, and fog constrain journey and charge final pier image; sensory hierarchy reflects archivist's fragment bias, mirroring internal states through purposeful navigation without static repetition. Recurring trumpet as micro-setting enables pivotal assembly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to hearten via compiling fragments escalates accumulatively through part acquisitions narrowing options (janitor's directions, woman's trade-off), forcing agency in bargain; cost legible in satchel's emptiness and final breath, though one deepening suffices without micro-turn overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of absence-into-meaning emerges from particulars like pitted valve and missing boots, reweighted in ending image without moralizing; subtext in woman's "exile tastes" and archivist's echo-promise invites ambiguity on restoration's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in fragment/silence metaphors modulates with intensity; single POV stable, dialogue subtextual (janitor's tallies, woman's grip) advances goals with idiom distinction. Rhythmic compression peaks purposefully in closure breath.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm supports propulsion, but figurative layering ("cobblestone a word washed away") borders overwriting in opening without obscuring closure; no loops, strong verbs propel, final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival quest as sonic restoration transforms exile trope via reactively visionary trades; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from valve's warming fit to resonant fold.</comment>
