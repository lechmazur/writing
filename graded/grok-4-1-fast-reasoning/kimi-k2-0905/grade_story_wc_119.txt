<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Chen's interiority shines in embodied pulses syncing with the beam and micro-choices like palming film, earning his departure; keeper applies light pressure via dialogue. Minor abstract slips in "accidentally prophetic" epiphany avoid deeper contradiction. Final renunciation feels compelled by prior traits without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns of light, secrets, and fortunes build to CR closure: Chen's skiff departure reweights his spy life with the cost of internalized island in "its stones tuning his ribs." Orientation anchors instantly; one tightening via self-applied prophecy narrows options cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse constrains via lamp exposure and granite "lithophone" chiming, charging final "submerged spine... hummed" image; sensory hierarchy (light pulses, salt wind) filters through Chen's spy-sage bias. Evolves causally with tide and departure; no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to transpose life signaled early, tightens texturally when fortune bores into self ("words burrow"), forcing agency in skiff untie with felt cost of entrapment. Pressure coheres without reversal overload; island-as-body charges poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Open secrets theme emerges organically from fortunes as "words so obvious no one believed," reweighted in self-fulfilling departure without moralizing; final "lyrics... no buyer could decrypt" answers via image. Complexity lingers in prophecy's ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in light-as-shutter motifs; voice rhythm modulates (short oar pulls at end). Dialogue subtextual ("light talks?") pursues evasion; no head-hopping, diction fits cryptic sage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "pulse syncing... turning beam"); varied rhythm passes read-aloud. Purposeful metaphor density taught early pays in closure without muddle; minor "open secret" repeats pattern-motivated, no loops dulling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spy-fortune writer in lighthouse darkroom synthesizes espionage and prophecy freshly; self-prophecy turn inevitable from particulars. Bold textural risks heighten stakes without gimmick; no template echoes.</comment>
