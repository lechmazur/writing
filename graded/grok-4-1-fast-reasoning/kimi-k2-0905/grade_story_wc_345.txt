<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's altruism drives micro-choices like chilling dew into messages, with embodied doubt ("doubt crawled in") creating contradiction that earns her release; Kai's brief role adds relational crucible without dilution. Minor abstraction in collective emotions slightly undercuts peak embodiment during harvest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of chalk messages and bell rings builds to Charged Poise closure in Mara's tether loosening and final bell ring, with legible cost in her fading into nebula ("her edges blurring"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via iridescent pigment message suffices. Pattern taught without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Floating arches constrain harvest choices, tilting as inciting pressure; watering bell as micro-setting evolves tactilely (rung by breeze, carried by Kai, final farewell gust), charging closure image. Sensory hierarchy (condensation ankles, violet tongue-taste) reflects ghostly POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchestrate harvest against arch tilt/ghost fear) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening messages (frost to pigment) narrowing options; colonists' chains show agency with visible sway-cost. Closure cost felt in collective binding vs. Mara's release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of collective survival emerges organically from chalk evolution and bell motif shifting to "pure, unbrambled" release; final sidewalk message ("family is the crop") reweights strangers-to-family without stating moral, lingering via childrens' pause. No tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person voice stable, perceptual signature ghostly (drifts, chills dew); rhythmic modulation peaks in harvest ("human ropes swaying above cloud"). Minimal dialogue natural; purposeful elision of actions fits accumulative pattern, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (short harvest sentences amid lyric flow); motifs like "brambled hope" cohere without muddle. Minor overwrite in metaphors during climax ("grandmothers anchoring ropes with stories... toddlers passing fruit") risks density drag but doesn't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi orchards, dew-chalk ghosts, and respite nebula transforms ghost trope into communal heartbeat; risk in poetic accumulative structure heightens stakes, culminating inevitably in violet reservoir image.</comment>
