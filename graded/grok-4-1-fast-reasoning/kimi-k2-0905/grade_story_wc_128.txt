<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marisol's shrewd traits shine in disguised waivers and drafting receipt on manifest; contradictory caution (hide self) yields to passing locket with felt cost of memory loaned out. Internal conflict embodied in studying photo "like others pray." Final micro-choice hierarchy reveals compassion over possession, earned by revelations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of kindness links (fees→envelope→mother save→Dalia funds→locket pass). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure as CR in "compassion... only ever on loan," reweighting cycles with undeniable relational cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Library clerestory/windows flapping like gulls constrain reflective isolation until rustle forces engagement. Wharf derelict with NGO vessel charges delivery climax. Recurring stars/ lantern beam evolve to mirror internal cycles, filtering through Marisol's maritime bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quiet compassion) signaled in waivers/tug to celebrate unseen; accumulative deepening via envelope revelations narrows to on-page delivery choice, foreclosing revelation risk. Agency in proposing night trip, cost legible in locket handover altering personal anchor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cycles emerge implicitly from particulars (mother's skiff→Beto's nephew→Dalia's stipends→locket loan); final image non-literally answers by reweighting kindness as freight "on loan," with conceptual cost of impermanence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature maritime-inflected ("ledger of kindness," "gull wings"); stable limited third modulates rhythm with pressure (short sentences in walk/exchange). Dialogue subtextual (no surnames, stories as mirrors); distinct voices (Beto's humming off-key).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: "salt wind flapped... gull wings" does sensory/action/voice in one. No loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (tide/cargo cycles) without muddle in peak (lantern "guiding nothing yet celebrating everything"). Propulsion peaks in dawn trucks rumble.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: maritime compassion ledger transforms kindness trope via locket/currency/envelope chain; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in "another cycle beginning exactly where the last one resolved."</comment>
