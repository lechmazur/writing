<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in "I am afraid the quiet will be worse than the noise," earning the final drinking choice with embodied cost of internalized ravine; rational distrust of "rational" shown through micro-whisper to occlude truffle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to film-climb reversal, scattering mixture into luminous reveal that forces consent, landing Charged Poise RR closure where bearing chorus reconfigures options with felt cost in doubled vision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hanging roots like nooses constrain kneeling/mixing choice and recharge in "roots relaxed their nooses," mirroring internal shift; storm sensory hierarchy (taste of regrets, green iris) biases through forager's perceptual filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to silence chorus signaled early, escalates via textural deepening (hissing mixture, ankle film, vision double) that narrows mute vs. bear, driven by agency in scooping/drinking with unmistakable cost of "ravine inside me."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of bearing fractured grace emerges organically; final "plant new truffles... bear together" reweights occlusion premise non-literally, resonating through prior reveals without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature—"scent rose, involuntarily truthful"—modulates rhythm under stress to hushed pulse; stable intimacy suits accumulative intimacy without withholding or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("fruits knocked together like teeth confessing"); figurative pattern taught early integrates without muddle or loops in peak film-climb beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Empathy virus + truffle/glass-eye cure synthesis transforms post-virus tropes into inevitable logic; risky poetic voice risks bold, heightening stakes in soul-bruise texture.</comment>
