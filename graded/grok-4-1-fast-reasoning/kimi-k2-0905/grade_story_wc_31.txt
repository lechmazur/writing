<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Jin's motivation to discover the color of sound roots in childhood hunt and intensifies through embodied micro-choices like cautious breathing in air pockets; interiority synesthetic and particular; final realization earned as CR with cost of foreclosed pursuit, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pier hiss to plankton colors, tightening at phonograph CR where sound reconfigures Jin with conceptual cost (personal spectrum-painting); orientation anchored early; closure legible on page with undeniable price in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken library constrains via tilting deck/air pockets risking collapse; lanterns/plankton recur to charge final pier lights; sensory hierarchy synesthetic via Jin's bias; 9+ test met as setting shapes dive tactics and ending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (color of sound) signaled early, deepens via lily flare to full spectrum under Accumulative lens; agency in purposeful dive/opening forces trade-off (archive risk); cost felt in cautious exhales, but minor abstractness in stakes pre-safe caps at high 8s.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (sound as searching light) emerges from phonograph crescendo reweighting premise; final CR offers non-literal answer via Jin painted into spectrum; resonance from particulars like lily sigh, no moralizing; 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct synesthetic perceptual signature ("color of sound in the hiss"); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to strobing glow; stable close third-person limited; woman's whisper natural/subtextual; 9+ test passed, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm mirroring immersion; metaphors consistent in light/sound pattern without muddle; minor overwriting in descriptive runs (e.g., multiple "hush" variants) dulls one beat but closure image clean, no loops/artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synesthetic library/phonograph vows fresh synthesis transforming tropes; bold lyric risks (hush to singing lights) heighten stakes coherently; inevitable hindsight from early hiss to spectrum CR; 9+ test met with risk distinction.</comment>
