<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (loneliness "beneath my gilt") act in scene via micro-choices like copying the phrase onto calfskin and leaving it; final shared honesty earned by prior skin-blistering sensitivity and map-piecing compulsion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motif density of fragments/letters tightens to RR closure in vine-lifting image with felt vulnerability cost ("terrified... of running out of words before breath"); orientation anchored early in greenhouse/oasis drought.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse constraints (purifying vines wilting from lies, humid bamboo descent) shape sneaking and veil-lowering; zinc fragments recur to charge final pocket-clink image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lost conversations) deepens accumulatively via map-piecing to letter-offering and Corin encounter, narrowing pretense options; cost legible in throat-tightening confession and dawn emergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of candor irrigating drought emerges organically from vine/letter images, reweighting premise in non-literal final silhouettes and realization without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with calligrapher-biased perceptual signature (curling letters as scorched petals, zinc ridges); rhythmic modulation peaks in terse "Their first honest sentence was about how terrified they were."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (petals/tendrils/moth wings) taught early, propels via varied rhythm; minor metaphor density in peak beats slightly risks overwrite but serves lens without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligraphic post-apocalypse where lies wilt flora transforms tropes via zinc-map/letter-altar; risk-taking in silent piecing-to-truth arc heightens stakes organically.</comment>
