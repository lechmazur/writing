<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory fear of the keeper's suicide and endurance via stone-stacking show impulses acting simultaneously; final bottling choice earned by prior chain causality with emotional cost in the unlit tower. Warmly observant trait particularized through stone-Morse reading without labels. Minor reflective summaries anchor cleanly to present cues without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of object gestures (stones, glass) builds to Charged Poise closure where final palm-held warmth reconfigures radiance as sufficient memory, cost legible in "starless dark" and "luminescent ache." Orientation anchored by ~50 words (skiff, cliff, tower). Single scene with BRR-compliant reflections tilting present micro-choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lantern room constrains choices (boots creaking hush, gust exhales) and charges final image; sea glass/stones as micro-setting evolve tactilely (clink in flask, rolls into palm). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (skipper notices salt-ghosts, quartz stripe). No white-room; spatial choreography (rail, catwalk, stairs) coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chain unbroken vs. keeper lost) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via stone click reversal confirming endurance; agency in adding stone/bottling forecloses forgetting path with felt cost in lamp's death. Cost unmistakable in "horizon stitched with black wire."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory sufficing against forgetting emerges from stone/glass particulars; final "green warmth...to the bone" non-literal answer reweights premise without moral, ambiguity in keeper's presence lingers purposefully. No sermonizing; irony in witnessed absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (observes glass hues, stone origins); rhythmic modulation accelerates in "heart hammering" memory, breathes in final image. Prose texture distinct (lyric compression taught early via wind "sighs"). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "shadows pooled where light once conspired" advances atmosphere/character/stakes); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives coherent/patterned ("frozen tears," "dawn trapped under skin") without muddle in peak (stone click) beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: stone-Morse chain transforms lighthouse trope via tactile silence; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes (unseen keeper) without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from first-stack memory to bottled reprise.</comment>
