<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority concrete but slips into diagnostic epiphanies like "clocks didn't measure hours but rather the distance between who we were and who we might become," undercutting embodied contradiction; motivation intensifies credibly via anomaly but lacks raw contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal reversal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from uphill water to station dissolution; CR closure lands cleanly in final paragraph with conceptual cost of identity shift; orientation anchored early by station and whistle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting's brass instruments and fjord constrain perception and reversal act; razor edges motif charges final softening image, mirroring internal reconfiguration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of anomaly comprehension tightens via hydraulic reversal under Accumulative lens, narrowing to key-turn with felt cost in world's inversion; one decisive deepening suffices, agency in counterclockwise turn forecloses linear time path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of non-linear time emerges from recurring images like ripples and key-turn, resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing; direct articulations like final "time was never something we moved through" slightly blunt subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature in hydraulic/horizon filters; rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive to compressed in reversal climax, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene intensity, high density integrates action/image; patterned repetition of "razor edges" and "fjord quiet" taught early without loops obscuring reversal; minor metaphor density in peak beat ("frozen lightning") coherent but borders overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh hydraulic-time premise synthesizes philosophy with tactile reversal; risk in lyric non-linearity pays off in inevitable CR, transforming clock tropes through fjord specificity.</comment>
