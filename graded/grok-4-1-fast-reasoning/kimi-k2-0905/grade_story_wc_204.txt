<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Corwin's motivation to fill his "cracked chase" with the whisper drives consistent, intensifying choices like uncorking despite warnings; contradictory impulses peak in pressing the sentence amid destabilization. Interiority embodied in "fingers ink-stained and trembling" and pulse-skipping cost. Final step onto cloud earned by prior micro-choices, foreclosing stable reality with felt personal price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from frost-reading to uncorking, culminating in CR closure where "time folded like a signature" reconfigures eternity with undeniable cost in pulse skip and library sigil. Orientation anchored early (Corwin at prow, dawn post-Shift). Single surreal scene coherent, no shards; pivotal rupture moment pays off disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glass orchard shelves and frost patterns constrain choices (reading code only at dawn) and charge final image (spiral frost etches lungs). Sensory hierarchy surreal yet selective: chiming fruit, oily pollen, tilting deck mirror Corwin's priorities. Evolving details (cracking apples, warped orrery) causal with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compress eternity) signaled early, tightens via uncorking reversal that destabilizes library, forcing Corwin's hand on wet ink with pulse cost. Under Accumulative lens, density cadence shift reweights to invitation, agency in feeding vellum and stepping through pane. Escalation driven by choices, visible prices (deck lists, fractures) alter tactics to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rupture-invitation emerges organically from images like "shorter path between heartbeats" and sigil-fold, reweighting premise without statement. Final image ("pockets full of type slugs clinking") offers non-literal answer to eternity's compression, charging prior frost/whisper motifs with conceptual cost. Complexity in ambiguity of destruction-as-progression lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in surreal biases ("gears petals," "frost teeth"); rhythm modulates from deliberate dawn ritual to breathless rupture. Compression taught early via poetic elision, paid in legible CR closure. No dialogue; diction/rhythm heighten pressure without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "sentence bit the paper like frost teeth" advances plot/atmosphere/image); rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion peaks in "clouds surged up, punching through." Minor figurative density in destabilization beat risks overwrite but pattern-consistent and closure-charging, no loops/artifacts dulling image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of letterpress orchard and negotiable reality feels inevitable, transforming tropes (floating library, bottled essence) via grounded surreal logic. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes (eternity's cost in heartbeat), fresh inflection in frost-spiral invitation. No derivatives; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
