<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (quantifying emotion vs. spiral's math) act in the confession beat; final crushing choice earned by causal buildup of relational pressure with Mira. Interiority concrete and embodied (secret "pressed against his ribs like a bird"). Minor diagnostic phrasing like "scientifically romantic paradox" earns no deduction as it precedes embodied action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to CR closure in crushed pocket-sun spreading light, reweighting absence-to-presence with relational cost legible in transformed shell. Orientation anchored in opening line. Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ember nexus fissures and twilight constrain choices (light on shell cues confession) and charge final image (glass sings under released light). Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (heat as "hearth"). No generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (presence vs. absence) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via confession and Mira's response forcing crushing agency; cost in foreclosed selling path felt in shared light. One deepening suffices, charges closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final shell image offers resonant answer to presence paradox, reweighting prior pocket-sun sales without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from particulars like shell's warmth transfer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in lyrical bias toward alchemical images (light "like a whispered promise"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven (Mira's "By returning differently" enacts shift). Stable third-limited POV, rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but figurative overwriting in peak (palette/caramel/magma metaphors dense without full pattern payoff) dulls closure slightly; minor synonym churn on "light" (-0.4). Read-aloud rhythm varies purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy and presence physics feels inevitable in shell's transformation; risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
