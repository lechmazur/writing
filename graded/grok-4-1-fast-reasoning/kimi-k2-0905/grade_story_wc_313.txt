<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied ("mirrored hush inside her chest"); micro-choices under pressure (pocketing label as "evidence," then tearing it) reveal hierarchy of values, earning shift from private grief to shared memory with visible cost in release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries build density to CR closure (tearing flakes onto water reconfigures private vs. shared past) with conceptual cost legible in "private grief she could finally release"; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (boots skidding on slime, water lapping bricks) and charges final image (ridgeway under first star for photographing town); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (warden's flashlight slicing twilight).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (humane patrol confronts personal past) signaled early, tightens via photo trail to father's secret, forcing renunciation (tear label) with felt emotional cost; agency in gathering prints forecloses private path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resurfaced loss rewritten as shared survival emerges organically; final image ("tore the label into tiny blue flakes") offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting photos from scandal to "museum of common loss."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (professional precision in "precisely humane," biased noticing of father's script); rhythmic control modulates from descent tension to charged poise at ridgeway.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (read-aloud flows from short punches like "boots skidding" to longer builds); no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures ("damp gauze") propel without overwriting, perfect opener/closer cadence.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: drowned town resurfacing as memory trail transforms relic trope into living text; risk in lyric CR ("rewritten nightly") heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
