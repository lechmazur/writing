<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to process grief through art is rooted in particular traits like charcoal fingers and woven lies, with embodied contradiction in positioning the chair as "comfort, then as absence." Internal conflict emerges via fragmented stories tilting present choices, earning final endurance of absence. Minor slip: epiphanic summaries slightly outweigh simultaneous impulses acting in the scattering beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of powder spirals and memory fragments tightens from chair placement to final orbiting spirals as Conceptual Repricing. Orientation anchored early in gallery convergence; closure costs legible in "confession that arrives too late to change anything except the shape of absence." No penalty as pattern pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vanishing point gallery constrains choices via calculated sight lines and breathing walls mirroring internal convergence; lighting shifts evolve to charge final moving shadows. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (charcoal smudges, porcelain press on cheekbones); recurring chair/powder handled tactilely, mirroring grief without overt symbolism. Final spiral image recharges environment as micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of crystallizing emotion via installation signaled early, escalates accumulatively through powder spirals reweighting absence as throne/planet orbits. Agency in scattering forecloses complete stories with felt cost of perpetual incompleteness; one deepening sufficient under lens. Minor abstractness in stakes before chair-stop beat prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of incomplete truths crystallizing absence emerges organically from porcelain grinding, spiral paths, and rocking syncopation, inviting ambiguity in "truth and fiction become indistinguishable." Final image resonates via dying-star orbits but weakened by explicit "safety is always a mirage" statements bordering thematic echo in closing lines (−0.6).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable with perceptual signature of synesthetic memory (runners whisper like last breath); rhythmic modulation builds via lengthening shadows. Purposeful compression taught early in mask halo, legible at spiral cadence; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: images like "powder settles into the spiral's grooves" multi-task character/atmosphere. Minor template cadence in repeated "the way... the way..." and "like the... like the..." strings (−0.5); figurative density consistent/voice-motivated, no muddle at closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Porcelain-from-tiles mask and powder spirals transform grief installation into fresh premise of vanishing-point dissolution; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration of rocking as crystallized stasis inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
