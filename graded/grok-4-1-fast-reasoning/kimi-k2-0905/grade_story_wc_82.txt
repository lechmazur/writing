<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied grief and micro-choices, like inhaling the leaking dream until ribs glow, reveal contradictory impulses of holding/releasing with earned final renunciation. Lantern maker's crafty skills anchor motivation consistently. No safety-hedging; flaws (lingering shadow) compound to charge closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from stair paradox to folding ritual, culminating in Charged Poise RR via smoke rising neutrally and hands' scent shift—clear before/after with felt release cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. One tightening at moonstone crack suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Floating tea garden and basilica constrain path/ritual (southern stair paradox, tea leaf as final fuel), charging closure image; sensory details like chiming leaves and iron-lullaby threshold filter through lantern maker's priorities. Micro-setting (moonstone, paper) evolves tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform dream/grief) signaled early, escalates via inhale-fold under "luminous torment," agency in ritual forecloses holding path with moonstone dust cost. Accumulative deepening reweights via crane flock orbiting her.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grief-as-flame/light theme emerges organically from folding cranes and leaf chimney; final smoke image offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration of ascent/descent paradox without moralizing. Particulars like "red snow that tasted of cinnamon" build complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in light/craft metaphors ("lantern maker never wastes fuel"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, prose-as-character in folding syntax reflecting grief's creases. Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; no loops/artifacts, figurative language pattern-taught via light/dream motifs pays off without muddle in peak folding beat. Final line's image recharges opening kerosene scent cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-engines, grief-cranes, and paradox-stair transforms tropes organically; risk in sustained lyric fantasy heightens emotional stakes, inevitable in hindsight via craft-grief logic. Bold tone commitment without retreat.</comment>
