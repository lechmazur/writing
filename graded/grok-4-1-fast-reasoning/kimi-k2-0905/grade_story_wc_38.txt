<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of motivation through micro-choices like rolling dice and swallowing the page, earning the final internalization with visible bodily cost; interiority particular via dance-infused perception without stock phrasing. Contradictory impulses surface in surrendering to the vortex despite prior caution. Single-POV voice coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via dice roll to archive entry; on-page CR closure via ingested seed and buoy trigger reconfigures vulnerability into strength with lab's silver sigh as cost. Orientation anchored early in drowned corridors. No shards exceed scope; pattern taught immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sunken lab constrains choices (flooded console, vortex shaft, sputtering valve) and charges final rise through moonlit waves; spider web micro-setting times the arc precisely. Sensory hierarchy narrows under urgency to silt, bubbles, bioluminescent pulse. POV bias filters via lyrical dancer's lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete decryption/liberation) signaled early, escalates texturally via deepening pattern (dice obey, current waltzes, seed germinates) narrowing to bodily encryption; agency in arabesque surrender forecloses safe paths with lab-shudder cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-as-strength emerges organically from dance ciphers and ingested page, resonant in child's unconscious movement without moralizing; final lullaby image reweights premise non-literally. Complexity via scientists' defiant flood embraces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with dancer's perceptual signature (metronome water, cursive ankles); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, compression taught early in poetic elisions payoff at spiral dance. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful figurative texture (e.g., "voice braided with bubbles") coherent across beats, no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies for ear, climax clear in "warm pressure that tasted like salt and singing." Figuratives pattern-taught without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms code-breaking trope via dance encryption and bodily data-seed in sunken lab; fresh synthesis of spider-web clock, hangman's dice compass, and child-echo closure feels inevitable. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
