<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in embodied sensations like palms on warm stones feeling the island's heartbeat, rooting philosophy in body; motivation for hidden effort consistent and intensifies via whisk discovery. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure, with smooth contemplation over tested micro-choices. Strong single-POV coherence elevates to publishable despite no relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build in patterns/fireflies to CR closure: whisk's moon spiral reconfigures hidden effort as outward ripples, cost legible in "small and necessary" settling like salt film. Orientation anchored early in stairs/harbor; one tightening at foot striking whisk suffices. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Selective sensory weave (slick stairs' dark commas, moon-silvered puddles, fireflies stitching rigging) filters through POV bias for patterns, constraining blind spiral walk. Parapet stones evolve from heat to whispering release, mirroring internal rhythm and charging whisk find. Micro-setting (whisk, stones) indispensable to discovery image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appreciate hidden effort) signaled early, escalates texturally via cadence shift from loss to synchronized fireflies/whistle affecting oarsman. Agency in blind stepping/whistling forecloses doubt with felt cost in demure joy. Minor abstractness in stakes softens peak legibility but one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of invisible acts rippling as moon paths emerges organically from whisk inscription matching walked spiral, reweighting mending without statement. Final image of knots as sea whistles offers resonant non-literal answer, ambiguity in "practicing" lingering meaningfully. No moralizing or echo artifacts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature biases to rhythms/patterns (fireflies' code, bamboo heartbeat), with rhythmic syntax modulating from contemplative to charged poise at whisk spin. Stable close-third POV, purposeful compression legible under textural lens; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "stepping sideways... tracing a spiral she could not see but somehow knew" advances action/character/theme); rhythmic variety passes read-aloud. Heavy figurative layering ("scintillatingly somber" reprise, spiral motifs) risks overwrite but pattern-taught and closure-charging avoids muddle. Minor synonym churn in "hidden effort/patterns" dings propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms net-mending into pattern philosophy via whisk's carved moons matching firefly-timed spiral, inevitable in hindsight. Bold lyric risk in textural drive heightens stakes of invisibility without gimmickry. No derivative echoes or hedging.</comment>
