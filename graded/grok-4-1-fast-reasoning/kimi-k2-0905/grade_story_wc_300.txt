<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations densify from pearl's pulse to mirror's ripple, landing Charged Poise CR closure where her integration into the "single enormous heart" reconfigures options with legible permanence cost in the convoy's discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystal caves constrain via "mineral tears" revealing confessions when pearl pressed and charge final mirror imprint; sensory hierarchy (taste of "salt and iron," resonant echoes) filters through Mara's witnessing bias.</comment>
