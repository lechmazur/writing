<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mila's diligence shines in micro-choices like scraping rosin for ink and weaving antennae, rooting motivation in copyist traits; contradictory fear (inspectors) and longing act simultaneously in nightly returns. Final non-fleeing endurance forecloses escape with felt cost as inspectors burst in. Minor poetic abstraction in emotions doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from radio hiss to solstice chord via nightly deepening; orientation anchors immediately in alcove and famine. Closure as Conceptual Repricing: dust narrates, reweighting silence with conceptual cost in inspectors' transformation and city mist fragments. One tightening at "pressed transmit" holds without micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mist, rosin dust, and orchestra pit constrain tactics (hiding pages, antennae); dial's green glow recurs to charge final afterglow image. Sensory hierarchy (phosphor fingers, iron mist) reflects copyist bias. No white-room; spatial choreography clear through alcove to pit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive stories) signaled early, escalates texturally via clearer voice and solstice prep narrowing to one-chance broadcast; agency in amplifying dust forecloses capture risk. Inspectors' arrival complicates, forcing stance crystallization with visible cost in their staggering inhalation. Coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of smuggled stories emerges from encoded intervals and dust vibration, not statement; subtext in pirate phrases like "embers plot their escape." Final image—city mist carrying chord—resonates non-literally, reweighting famine premise with lingering ambiguity and no tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in musical noticing ("minor thirds for grief"); lyrical diction modulates rhythmically with intensity, compressing at climax. Broadcaster phrases carry subtext as elusive lyrics. No head-hopping; voice particular and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines layer image/action (e.g., "emptied her inkwell and filled it with powdered rosin"); metaphors cohere in music/dust pattern without muddle. Rhythms vary, propulsion builds to airborne score; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Pirate encoding stories in intervals transforms dystopian trope into fresh synthesis of music, dust, mist; risk in solstice amplification heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from early radio tuning to dust narration; no derivative echoes.</comment>
