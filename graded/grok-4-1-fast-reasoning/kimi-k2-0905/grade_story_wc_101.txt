<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation rooted in exile past compels micro-choices like hiding formula and declaring ledger, with endurance earned via Lita dialogue; minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak beats prevents 9+. Boy and Lita apply targeted pressure without diluting focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from cart run to pebble spiral and silent bell ring as Charged Poise closure with cost in sanctions tightening; orientation anchored by ~100 words (Mara's bell, cart, alleys); one tightening via "triple the midnight food runs."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor flakes "like dried blood" and ridge vantage constrain signaling/oversight, charging final image where it "waited like an open mouth"; sensory hierarchy (muffled bell, rattling wheels) selective via Mara's priorities; no generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sustain community) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Lita's "sanctions tighten" warning forcing "triple the runs" trade-off; agency in endurance forecloses surrender with legible cost in heavier cart/risks; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory/resistance emerges organically via ledger/pebbles/bell, resonant non-literal answer in silent vibration linking elders/orphans; final image reweights quiet as power without moralizing; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (silence "amplified quiet"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("bell still remembers our real names"); rhythmic modulation peaks in closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; minor overwriting in metaphors ("dawn bruised," "unbanned prayer") in non-peak beats, but no loops/artifacts dulling closure; "gently persistent" pattern-taught without churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sanctions resistance via silent bell/pebble spiral as ledger; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens quiet stakes, inevitable in hindsight; no template echoes.</comment>
