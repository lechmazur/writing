<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak at the arch ("revelation is not a hammer; it is a dialogue"), compelling the gentle breakage with embodied cost in softening stone skin; interiority particular to mineral awakening avoids epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of telepathic awakenings tightening to CR closure; cost legible in "certainties dissolved into questions" as garden reconfigures from stasis to growth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Keystone arch's "mortar had turned to sugar" constrains the pivotal breakage and charges final image of growing corals; sensory details (tasting barnacles' grief) bias through statue's mineral perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to infuse nuance escalates accumulatively through statue interactions questioning stasis; agency in cracking ampoule forecloses certainty with on-page cost of dissolved truths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of nuance over certainty emerges via particulars like poison/remedy roots and foxglove; final bubble message offers non-literal resonance reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thought bloom... like warm ink") modulates rhythmically with intensity; stable single-POV elides nothing unearned, prose as character in stone syntax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "glided—over gardens... shedding flakes"); varied rhythm passes ear test, purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic stone awakening transforms drowned city trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via gardener's mercy.</comment>
