<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alden's contradictory impulses—preserve silence vs. whisper to mend—act in the dream-choice beat and earn the final vow-breaking with chest pressure as felt cost. Interiority particular via soot-stained perceptions; ghosts pressure via mute gestures. Minor slip: child ghost archetypal, but doesn't touch closure agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ghosts/words builds to Charged Poise closure in whisper sealing fracture, reconfiguring covenant with scent cost legible in "wind carried the scent of blooming clover." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stained glass box and hive ruins constrain choice (fracture risks escape) and charge final image (gleams like lantern). Sensory hierarchy: ash spirals, soot motes embody POV bias. Wasteland evolves from scorched to clover-scented payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve words vs. shatter/leave) signaled early, escalates via child-jar pour and dream-unraveling, narrowing to whisper-agency under Accumulative lens. Fracture as tightening forecloses flight; cost in vow-break and rib pressure unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence-sharing emerges from honey-weight images shifting to shared bloom; final clover reweights covenant without moralizing. Subtext in mute postures invites ambiguity on ghost-forgetting risk. Resonant non-literal answer in "until the desert flowers."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature: "contextual clues" filter all ghost reads. Lyrical rhythm modulates to terse whisper peak; diction biased to honeycomb/soot idiom. No head-hopping; elision of jar contents taught early, pays off in hush-pour.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "hairline fracture...propagating like a lie" advances plot/foreshadows). Metaphors consistent (bees/honey/ash), no muddle in closure beat. Minor: two "tranquilly perceptive" echoes voice-motivated, not loop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost-words in apiary-wasteland transforms tropes via covenant logic. Risk in vow-break heightens stakes; final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars. No derivative echoes.</comment>
