<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quartz-eye mender's interiority shines in embodied persistence ("sap rose, hissing") and feisty curses aligning with motives; generational bridge culminates in daughter's cambium touch, earning change with cost. Contradictory impulses act in graft whisper ("I persist, you persist"). Flawless under pressure, no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from bag-opening to scroll-reading to graft, culminating in CR where ribbon's rot reweights vows into "unspoken covenant" with conceptual cost of composted promises. Orientation anchored early (nave stairs, orchard rafters). One tightening via pollen/ribbon lash suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cathedral orchard rafters constrain climbs/grafts, charging final image (ribbon in bark); sensory details (fig scrolls, sap hiss, pollen freckles) filter through mender's priorities, evolving causally (lightning scar to buds). Micro-setting (ribbon, gear) shapes choices perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heal post-breach orchard) signaled early, escalates via bag wisdom deepening to graft agency under Accumulative lens; one tightening (scroll clause on apology) narrows to persistence renunciation vs. elders. Cost legible in barred doors, ribbon forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of vows-as-leaves emerges organically via particulars (scrolls in figs, ribbon graft), resonant CR reanswers "vows grow back?" non-literally ("promises are leaves"). No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in orchard's forgiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual bias ("quartz monocle flashing," "accidental wisdom"); stable single POV, rhythm modulates (short graft sentences under stress). Dialogue sparse but natural/subtextual ("orchard would decide").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel; purposeful metaphors (e.g., "petals snow across nave") taught early, pay off at closure without muddle. Minor overwrite in opening density (-0.3), no loops touching graft/closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cathedral orchard, quartz guild, ribbon-as-graft transforms tropes; risk in mosaic time-jumps (week/years) heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via "photosynthesize into hope."</comment>
