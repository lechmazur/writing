<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between forgery kindness and wood-truth integrity act in scene via carving discovery; final confession choice earned by mother's request causality, with embodied cost in palm cuts and vomiting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as reflective density builds to CR closure in final image of shared sky-watch; cost legible in "light enough to carry the weight," reweighting lies without decisive plot act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Driftwood carvings constrain search choice and charge closure via honest-face find; cobalt terrace mirrors internal dusk-to-black shift, sensory specifics (kelp tangle, salt-smoothed faces) filter through Elias's guilt bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of quelling guilt tightens accumulatively via mother's syntax recognition and carving portrait; agency in climbing steps and handing watch forecloses fabrication path with relational cost felt in tempered poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image non-literally answers "weight of withheld truth" by reconfiguring lies as permission; theme emerges organically from particulars like double-spaced periods, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in wood-grain Braille and lying rings; stable close-third POV with rhythmic modulation under stress, minimal dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "brass edge cutting crescents" advances emotion/props); varied rhythm, no loops, purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle in peak carving beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fake genealogies vs driftwood truths transforms confession trope; risk in reflective mode heightens emotional specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
