<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in "Her claustrophobia screamed, but the gold fleck sang louder," driving micro-choices like tracing and naming despite embodied fear; final endurance/renunciation of isolation carries felt cost in wider obligation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density from gold fleck to lacquer, culminating in RR closure ("phase transition reversed") with conceptual cost legible in recoiling signal and ebbing claustrophobia replaced by remembering's weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Basalt throat pulsing with surf and knees scraping volcanic glass constrain descent choices; final waves licking boots charge closure image, mirroring internal shift under sensory filter of brine-thick air.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witnessing unremembered) deepens via naming that thins fleck, forcing trade-off in crawl through steepening tunnel; agency in glove on Voss's palm yields on-page cost of physical strain and fear reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of witness returning the forgotten emerges via naming freeing technicians, reweighting gold tracks motif; final "names repeating in her chest like heartbeat" offers resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in gold-fleck synesthesia and claustrophobic narrowing; Voss's whisper carries subtext of open circuit, modulating rhythm under stress without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "liquid thread that seeped into the air" integrated into action; no loops, rhythmic propulsion varies from short stress beats to flowing reversal, clear at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cable-signal horror and phase-shifting witness transforms tropes via gold-fleck naming mechanic; risk in lyric descent/ascent heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at codex settling.</comment>
