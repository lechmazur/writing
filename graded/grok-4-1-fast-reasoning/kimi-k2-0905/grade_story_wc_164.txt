<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation roots in consistent recollectionist traits, intensifying through embodied emotions like curiosity as violet; micro-choices like arranging shards reveal values under pressure. Internal doubt bruises indigo but yields to action without strong simultaneous contradiction. Final change to new path earned by prior causality, though epiphanic sheen slightly tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from petal fragments to ash word "remember" to gold abandonment, culminating in Charged Poise as mosaic grinds to sand-whirlwind path. Orientation anchored early via Lira at crater glass in geode. Cost legible in cave sealing and her not looking back.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Geode cave pulses, transliterates emotions into colors, constrains via responsive walls exhaling breeze; shards as recurring object charge mosaic spiral to final path. Sensory hierarchy vivid: hush of tides, singing floor, salt-farewell taste. Final path ripples turquoise gratitude, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to discover path's disappearance signaled early, tightens via deepening from past vision to cliff's loneliness felt as gold pang, forcing new-story conjecture. Agency in gathering/arranging shards forecloses old route with cave-seal cost. Textural escalation reweights via pattern break in whirlwind path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of paths vanishing without wonder emerges via particulars like boy's starfish bucket and cliff's abandonment gold; final image of empty bucket ready for new constellations reweights without moral state. Resonance in shared land-heart ache, inviting reflection on memory's migration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: emotions as colors, paths as lullabies; rhythmic diction modulates from conjecture to laughing in cheerful gloom. Single aloud conjecture carries subtext. No head-hopping; voice poetic yet legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors taught early (transliteration), varying rhythm in "gloom felt cheerful, the way dawn sometimes smiles while burying the stars." Minor overwriting in stacked images like seeds clattering bells but no loops or muddle at closure whirlwind.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: emotion-crystal geode births memory-flowers from bird-seeds, grinding to living path; transforms loss tropes via wonder's agency. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
