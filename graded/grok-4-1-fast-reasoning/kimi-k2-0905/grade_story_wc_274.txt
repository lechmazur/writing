<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sera's interior conflict is embodied in pulse drumming and shaking hands during the upload decision, with contradictory duty/conscience impulses acting simultaneously; motivation to preserve stories compels the high-stakes choice with felt re-freeze risk. Minor diagnostic label ("bravely conflicted") slightly abstracts peak tension without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through because/therefore chain: letter discovery → secret networks → upload → cryo reseal as explosions signal truths spreading. Closure as Charged Poise in pod sealing with conceptual cost (library burn risk) legible in "If you burn, I will burn with you"; orientation anchored by ~50 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Snow-frosted library constrains via narrow shaft crawl melting on copper and thermal sleeve hiding letter, charging final image of sifting snow under aurora lights mirroring internal fire/ice fusion. Sensory hierarchy (hissing copper, humming columns) reflects archivist bias; no white-room, vivid causal evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release truths vs. duty) signaled early, tightens causally via upload micro-choice narrowing options amid guilt tremor; cost legible in foreclosed safety and potential mob destruction felt at hatch lock. Agency in renunciation of council loyalty culminates in stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of honest memory vs. power emerges organically from letter upload and final wind-carried words image reweighting preservation risk without moralizing. Resonance in ironic citizen awakening contrasts Sera's isolation; no tidy binary, ambiguity in rebirth/flame lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in biased noticing (data veins as "dormant networks," quiet as thrum); rhythmic modulation accelerates in shaft crawl, compresses at cryo seal. Voice texture distinct via frost-fire diction, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "exhalations became falling snow that melted on live copper, hissing"); varied rhythm passes ear test, purposeful lyric metaphors taught early without muddle in peak upload. Minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but supports tone; no loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cryo-archivist uploading via secret wires transforms whistleblower trope through lived vault specifics and fire/ice duality; fresh synthesis in library as cradle/tomb reconfigured by wind-loose truths feels inevitable. Risky quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
