<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's contradictory impulses—seeking company via "agreed upon lies" while pursuing building language—act in scene via seal rituals; final keeper acceptance earned with relational cost of perpetual solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of revelations (seal imprint, tutor dissipation, gargoyle speech) builds to CR closure: narrator repriced as keeper, cost legible in cyclical "borrow sugar" endurance spelled on window.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rooftop garden and meteor shower constrain timing/actions, charging gargoyle interrogation and final "stay" steam image; selective sensory details (clink, grind, jasmine) filter through linguistic POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (loneliness conjugated via language exchange) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through tutor reveal and inheritance, forcing narrator's stance crystallization with ongoing ritual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory/lies emerges organically from building "stress fractures" to future perfect walls; final window "stay" reconfigures premise without moralizing, lingering ambiguity of release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in grammatical metaphors ("dactyls of fire," "conjugate solitude"); single POV stable, rhythmic compression heightens revelation beats without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern taught early (buildings as language); no loops/artifacts dull closure—rhythm varies, propulsion peaks in gargoyle "grinding like a drawer."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistics/architecture/ghostly ritual transforms tropes; risk of lyric meteor hexameter pays off in inevitable gargoyle welcome, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
