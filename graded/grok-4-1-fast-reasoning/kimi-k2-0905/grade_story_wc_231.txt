<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied interiority peaks in "humming in her bones the way fog hums in a bell," revealing contradictory impulses to decode versus release; final memory sacrifice earns change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens builds via gap observations to vision and release; closure reconfiguration lands in "gaps began to close" with memory cost undeniably imaged on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mist and opal dock constrain choices from rail observation to edge release; recurring fog evolution charges final "closed eye" image, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode/repay debt) tightens texturally through vision "between one pulse and the next"; agency in flower release forecloses borrowed memories with personal cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of gestures as keepers emerges from flower-memory cycle without statement; release reweights premise non-literally in "petals loosening into tiny rafts."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in gap-reading; purposeful lyric compression taught early ("tide slapped... gaps") remains legible through charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic propulsion in descent ("boots now silent as if the staircase had grown moss"); no loops or muddle obscure; figuratives integrate crisply into closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of alpine flower as memory debt in misty nautical frame transforms isolation trope; release turn feels inevitable from gap pattern, heightening stakes.</comment>
