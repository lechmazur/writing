<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's reticence compels quiet testimony, with interior contradiction between cataloging belief and pattern reality shown in embodied listening; final witness renunciation earned via crystal's warmth and book fall, foreclosing control with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sound density spirals to pattern realization and book fall tightening; CR closure lands in "zygote" image reweighting language's end as growth's start, with undeniable conceptual cost legible in her sad smile and departure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shadowed library and dawn light constrain hearing via hush and crystal, filtering sensory hierarchy through scholar's bias; crystal as recurring micro-setting charges final image, mirroring inward growth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode growth signaled early, escalates texturally via fractured sequences to library exhale; agency in testifying forces endurance of witness over control, with cost felt in leaving glowing crystal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of inward growth emerges organically from sound spirals and pressed snowdrop; final "zygote" image offers non-literal resonant answer to silence-as-listening, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in sonic/memory noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from hushed to exhaling presence, voice coherent and biased toward scholarly fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful similes (dust motes, tree rings) integrated into action; minor simile density in sound sequences but no loops or muddle touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh post-dictionary hush-world transformed via crystal testimony and library voice; risk-taking in sonic accumulative frame heightens inward growth stakes organically.</comment>
