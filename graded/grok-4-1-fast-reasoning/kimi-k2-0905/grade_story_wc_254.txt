<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via "tremor of certainty in her pulse" and risk-aware micro-choices like precise recitation, earning internal shift to self-erasure; minor archetype feel in poet limits full individuality without harming closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from quartz song to lake thaw as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise); closure cost legible in "ice could re-freeze around her calves, a statue of precedent," reweighting boundaries.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Quartz pillars and ice fissures constrain choices (e.g., "fogged the crystal and rewrote its lattice") and charge final image of wings and waves; selective sensory weave (A-flat hum, thaw drips) mirrors perceptual dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of boundary dissolution tightens via phoneme shift ("None shall pass" to "stay") forcing riskier lake crossing; agency in recitation/endurance yields legible cost in potential entrapment, coherent under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of fluid laws emerges organically through image shifts (ice to mist to chorus); resonant CR in "every law is a rough draft of light" reweights premise, though near-explicit articulation slightly mutes subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with poetic perceptual signature ("quartz harmonies braid with her heartbeat"); rhythmic control modulates from hush to chorus without slippage, suiting lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "borders are parentheses we forget to close") taught early and propelling to closure; minor repetition of "dissolving boundaries" purposeful but borders on loop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic poetry and environmental law-rewriting feels inevitable via quartz/lake mechanics; bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmick, transforming trope of rebel artist.</comment>
