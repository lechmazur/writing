<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via sensations like teeth aching from resonance and pulse in chest/ground tying to grandmother's gift; motivation to navigate without moving earns final merge. Subtle internal conflict in seeking vs. stillness feels particular. Epiphanic phrasing like "he understood now" slightly abstracts pivotal realization without full contradiction in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern density (ripples, birds, harmonics) tightening to RR closure in arrowhead-sternum merge and becoming echo, reconfiguring home as stillness with identity-loss cost legible in "no longer separate." Orientation anchors early at canyon lip. Single scene fits scope; birds' shift as micro-turn pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bone towers and dust constrain/charge navigation via hum/vibration mirroring internal pulse; canyon echoes force stillness tactic. Sensory hierarchy (whispering dust, wingbeats as words) reflects POV reverence. Final vortex image evolves setting causally with song.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find pulse, navigate unmoving) signaled early deepens accumulatively via harmonics vibrating towers and birds' arrow reversal, narrowing to endurance in stillness. Agency in song and standing charges poise with cost of self-dissolution. Escalation coherent under lens; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory/home in patterns emerges via shifting bird spiral ("pointing not to what lay ahead but...behind") reweighting journey premise without statement. Resonance from particulars like ripples remembering skips; final roost answers via CR. Avoids tidy morals with lingering ambiguity of merger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pattern-noticing (strata as "wings of birds frozen mid-flight"); rhythmic prose modulates to stillness at peak. Stable close third-person POV teaches lyric compression early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "edges still sharp enough to draw blood" advances character/backstory); varied rhythm suits read-aloud. Purposeful repetition of "bone towers"/"patterns" builds texture without loops. Heavy figurative coherence (harmonic/tuning forks) risks overwrites in peak song beat but pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of harmonic gift, bone-tower resonance, and bird-pattern navigation transforms inward journey trope organically. Risky lyric stasis heightens stakes via stillness paradox. Irreplaceable premise integral to closure; no derivatives.</comment>
