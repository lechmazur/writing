<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Riven's motivation to heal promises roots deeply in embodied absences pressing his ribs; micro-choices like uncorking the storm compel higher stakes. Internal conflict in "chin lowered but eyes forward" reveals contradictory impulses. Final trade of weather for words earns change with felt cost, though some reflective phrasing borders abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from storm drop to mailbox trade, culminating in CR closure: "hush between sending and receiving" reconfigures absences into presence with legible conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early in arcade/mailman setup. One tightening via game's voice narrows path to key.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade's far-corner console constrains search and activates stakes; thunderstorm bottle as micro-setting charges final trade image. Sensory details like ozone tunnel and sloshing violet filter through Riven's priorities, evolving causally to rain. Twilight hush mirrors internal hush without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to heal promises signaled early, escalates accumulatively through drone threat and ritual acts to rain truces. Tightening at mother's voice revelation forces trade-off with visible cost in emptied bottle. Agency in linking absences forecloses isolation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of healing broken promises emerges organically from absences motif shifting to "heartbeat of promises being kept." Final image offers resonant CR repricing contraband love as presence without moralizing. Complexity in temporary truces embraces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable with perceptual signature in hush/ozone noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from brittle hush to heartbeat cadence. Mother's voice flicker carries distinct idiom. No head-hopping, purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion, high density in image-packed lines like "tokens clattered... spelling the route." Minor metaphor density ("neon veins flickering like dying stars") risks slight slowdown in opening but stays voice-motivated without loops or muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mailman smuggling storm via arcade mechanics transforms disputed territory trope; silver key from soda machine risks boldly to reroute history. Final envelope heartbeat feels inevitable from prior particulars without hedging.</comment>
