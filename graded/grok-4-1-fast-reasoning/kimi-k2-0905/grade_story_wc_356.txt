<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of ambition versus stillness act in grafting micro-choices; final shift to gratitude earned by olfactory risks and village response, with ambition's loosening as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via scent/motion density to Charged Poise closure; "ambition loosen into gratitude" delivers on-page reconfiguration cost without causal break; orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Treetop bark and spider-silk constrain stitch site/figure-eight knot; recurring indigo paper and scents charge notebook's final wrap as micro-setting mirroring internal serenity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of undisturbed graft tightens texturally via carrion rot balance and wind-spirits' choosiness; protagonist's breath-muting and sway-timing agency forecloses pollinator risk with felt olfactory cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"What is hidden feeds what is revealed" emerges implicitly through doodle-graft fusion; final spiral-seed-heart image offers non-literal repricing of serenity-motion without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Olfactory perceptual signature ("faintest breath of carrion promise") biases noticing; rhythmic sway syntax modulates pressure in ascent, stable close-third POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density in lines like "Stitch holds; seed sighs; village sways; I sway inside the sway"; varied rhythm propels without overwriting, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Scent-graft timed to "tide's thought" synthesizes fresh herbalist ambition via olfactorily haunted boughs; bold textural risks transform trope, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
