<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in smelting resistant identities via litany; final endurance of mutable self earned with felt cost in "hollow adjust around absence." Interiority concrete and particular through brass ribs, tilting designation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from net-casting to ribbon-winding to planting, culminating in Charged Poise CR where creel expands for future contradictions; cost legible in "hollow shaped exactly like tomorrow." Orientation anchored immediately in tidal atrium.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Environment constrains choices (boots hiss in surge, net lunar-charged) and charges final image ("creel glimmered, the ribbon pulsed, and the atrium water held a sky"); sensory hierarchy (salt on brass, water lapping) reflects mechanical POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve before moon scatters) signaled early, deepens via resistance ("fluttering against filament") forcing litany and planting; agency in cranking/smelting forecloses scattering path with cost in tilting self-identity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of preservation-through-motion emerges organically from fusion/release cycle; final image ("wonder...returns under another name") reweights routine as orbit-enabling without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in gear-ticking internals and tidal-mechanical diction; rhythmic control heightens pressure (short sentences in smelting surge), POV stable single focalizer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "gears clicked, extending filament net that hummed"); figurative pattern taught early (tide/memory metaphors) pays off without muddle or loops in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical librarian smelting migrating identities into mutable ribbon transforms preservation trope; risk in nonlinear time ("tomorrow dissolves") heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
