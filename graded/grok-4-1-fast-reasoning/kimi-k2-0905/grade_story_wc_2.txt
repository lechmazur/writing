<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied interiority peaks in pool ("chill climb his ribs like a ladder of mercury"), earning shift from routine certainties to embracing uncertainty; contradictory impulses act in descent and retrieval choices with visible cost of abandoning tinkering life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern density (leaves, ash, compass motifs) building to CR closure in final spinning image reweighting time as "waterfall"; pool alignment cadence shift delivers cost of foreclosed certainty without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cellar ash seam and waterfall ledge constrain descent/path choices; greenhouse leaves as micro-setting signal and charge final flagstone rose image, filtering through Elias's clock-biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs. uncertainty) tightens accumulatively via leaf pattern -> hatch press -> pool dunk, forcing trade-off renunciation; cost legible in leaving artifacts and locking shop.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of improvised uncertainty emerges organically from compass/watch sync and blank smiling clocks; final phantom admiral image resonantly reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature via clock metaphors ("tick he carried in his bones," "second hung like a droplet"); rhythmic diction modulates from precise tinkering to cavernous expansion without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (ashes/swirls) propels without loops; cavern metaphors cohere physically, accelerating at pool climax ("hands lurched forward").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Victorian clockwork and subterranean time-magic transforms lost-compass trope into conceptual admiral legend; years-later shard risks lyric closure payoff heightening stakes.</comment>
