<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via locket's warmth against pulse and sacrifice of personal photo, earning final renunciation; micro-choices like grafting image reveal values under demolition pressure. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak sketching beat keeps from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from sketches to hush and headlights; on-page Charged Poise closure in steeping locket reconfigures memory as planted rhythm, cost legible in "steep absence like a clean nail wound."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Barnacles, salt-rimmed planks, and sunflower petals constrain urgent sketching and charge final copper tube image; sensory hierarchy (tide hiss, gull laughter) reflects archivist's perceptual bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve vs. demolition signaled early, escalates accumulatively via engines, hush, headlights narrowing time; agency in locket sacrifice forecloses personal relic with felt cost, but one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory as verb emerges organically from ink grafts and covenant rhythm, final waltz reweighting "small moments" without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in tube as second heartbeat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (nets sigh, petals dried into wood); rhythmic prose modulates with pressure, stable single POV, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful motif repetition ("weight of small moments") propels accumulatively; minor overwriting in metaphor strings like "ink blooming like bruised violets" during peak hush slightly muddles propulsion but pattern holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh walnut-ink archivist premise transformed through specific tactile preservation and covenant philosophy; risk-taking in lyric reconfigurations heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via locket graft.</comment>
