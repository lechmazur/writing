<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solid interiority via embodied grief ("dive mask thick with tears") and micro-choices (tapping to wake tech); final role shift from proving loss to remembering regrowth earned by prior witness habits. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. invitation "stir like a eel") act in scene. Minor abstraction in epiphany slightly distances full embodiment at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: clue density (tapping anomaly, atlas page, sea pings) builds to CR closure where page insertion reweights premise ("role was never to prove loss but to remember the way back") with conceptual cost (delayed revelation sealed forever). Orientation anchored early (station, post-ban world). No slips touch decisive pillar moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station stilts, submersible, limestone stairs constrain choices (tapping wakes batteries, slot fits page); sensory selection (hollow sheen, silt cloud) sharpens urgency. Final station as "gate left ajar" charges image. POV-filtered marine details (broken teeth reefs) integrate seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover forgotten path) signaled via circled "Path 27"; agency-driven tightening (pry panel → descend → insert page) narrows to CR under accumulative lens. Cost legible in sealed page and resumed tapping foreclosing proof-for-loss path. Minor: stakes abstract until hologram, but density compensates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (hidden paths wait for witness) emerges organically via hologram ("not erased but hidden"); final image (tapping resumes as gate ajar) offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting grief to invitation without moralizing. Particulars (reef flicker, bright alphabets) build complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (marine metaphors like "gull with a broken wing") biases toward witness's oceanic grief; stable close third-person modulates rhythm with descent intensity. Purposeful compression legible; no elision debt. Voice coheres as singular eco-lament.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "tapping felt different; metal answered back" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion. Overwriting in stacked marine similes ("clenched its dead reefs like broken teeth") risks muddle in early beats, but pattern-taught and purposeful; minor recurring "tapping" phrasing purposeful, not looped.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eco-grief with hidden tech-reef (pillars storing hologram data); tapping as Morse-like summons transforms witness trope. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes; closure's "gate left ajar" feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
