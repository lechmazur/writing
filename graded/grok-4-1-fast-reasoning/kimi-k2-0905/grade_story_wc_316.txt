<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory numbness and stirring impulses act in confessions and hand-join climax; Zero's falter reveals shared flaw with embodied tremor, earning synthesis. Minor abstraction in "ego death that had hollowed her out" avoids full 9+ specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via confession density to pattern break at Zero's falter and pour-fluid RR closure; cost legible in "grief for the selves lost" and dissolution. Orientation anchors early; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dojo bell and rewrite window constrain timing of join; jar and blade handled tactilely charge final pour. Sensory violet pulse and creaking integrate via POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant ritual stake signaled early tightens at falter narrowing to joint agency; cost of individual erasure felt in merge under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Paradox of opposites emerges via rounds to wordless child answer reweighting attachment/detachment; final footprints image resonates without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("tasting color") biases to synesthetic numbness; stable close-third POV with sparse, subtextual dialogue advances ritual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density in pulsing images propels without loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (prism light, history wave) under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Surreal clone-opposites ritual in rewriting history synthesizes fresh; risky merge payoff inevitable from creed without gimmick.</comment>
