<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prophet's motivation to convert obstacles into instruments drives consistent micro-choices like striking absence, earning the final hearing; embodied via mallet swings and cloud readings. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats, but competence with struggle balances it. Final endurance of silence into groove feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: resonance layers densify from evening dubs to crew rhythms to crown spin, culminating in RR closure ("obstacle become instrument") with cost in initial stillness and incremental "inches, then yards." Orientation anchored early in raft/orchard; one tightening via spiral imitation suffices. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Raft orchard constrains via tree strikes and fruit nets mirroring internal rhythm; clouds as "broken lyre" to "nautilus" charge final eye-breeze. Sensory hierarchy (sounds over visuals under prophet) selective; spatial choreography clear through mast/prow glade. Recurrent mallet/petals evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pierce Doldrums) signaled early via clouds; prophet agency escalates through absence strikes, crew tapping, crown rigging under accumulative lens, narrowing to "edged forward" with felt cost in failed engines/laughter. One deepening via fractal spiral imitation forces trade-off. Coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resonance converting stasis emerges via particulars (petal notations, looped creaks); final "orchard become orchestra" reconfigures obstacle premise non-literally with conceptual cost in tuned drift. Subtext in communal heartbeats braiding solitude; no moralizing, ambiguity in prophet's unsmiling listen lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with musical perceptual signature ("clouds in arpeggios"); rhythmic syntax modulates from listing knocks to fractal spills under pressure. No head-hopping or withholding; elisions (e.g., rigging details) purposeful, paid in propulsion. Voice distinct, prose-as-mind reflects sonic bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: lines layer action/image (e.g., "petals...forming accidental notations"); varied rhythm accelerates in dawn beats without loops or scaffolds. Figuratives coherent (lyre/nautilus) under taught sonic pattern, no muddle in climax. Propulsion peaks in "throbbed with a thousand micro-rhythms."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sound-dubbed raft orchard transforms nautical stasis trope via fractal resonance logic, inevitable in hindsight from mallet to crown. Bold lyric risk (striking absence) heightens stakes; no derivatives, particular details like drumfish skin anchor vision.</comment>
