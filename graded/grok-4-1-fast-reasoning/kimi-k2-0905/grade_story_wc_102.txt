<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pilgrim's motivation rooted in past-life memory compels micro-choices like inviting the man to the camera and offering the bead, with embodied fracture healing as earned change. Contradictory ache of "affection folded until it cut" acts in scene via shared breathing. Man's mirroring tremor reveals shared flaw without stereotypes. Final pressing of tear to sternum forecloses isolation with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from petals shimmering on glass to door in condensation, culminating in Conceptual Repricing that "storage is not a place but a posture." Closure lands on-page with cost in "fracture knit... coolness" and afterimage. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single surreal scene coherent without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (wisteria "drinkable," breath "purple") filters through pilgrim's curiosity, constraining camera setup on parapet. Setting evolves causally: petals slow post-healing, charging final "lantern... lit" image. Micro-setting (ground-glass) guides pivotal exhale to door.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find unused love storage) signaled early tightens texturally via man's arrival and shared breathing, deepening to orchard with agency in her invitations. One decisive intensification suffices; cost legible in slowed heartbeats and bead release. Minor abstractness in initial map line slightly mutes early pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal breath vs. calcified love emerges organically from particulars like petals clustering "around his heart like moths." Final image reweights premise: silk "surrendering to the present" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Orchard fruit as "apologies never risked" avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (images "inhaled with her") stable in single close-third POV, modulating rhythm with intensity. Man's dialogue sparse, subtextual ("map... burns"), distinct from internal voice. Compression taught early pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors consistent (breath, petals) without muddle in peak orchard beat. Minor figurative density ("low green sunrise") risks strain but pattern-taught from opening. No loops; propulsion clear via image evolution to "transparent" breath.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera obscura as spirit projector and bead-breathing ritual transforms spiritual quest trope. Risky surreal door/orchard grows from established breathing pattern, heightening stakes organically. Final "distributing... sparks" inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
