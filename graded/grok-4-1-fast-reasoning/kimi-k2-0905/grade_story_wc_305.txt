<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in knees "scallop inward" during memory flood, earning final descent; hairpin ties motive to child-loss with felt cost. Boy as projection reveals caretaker's blind spot in fleeing wounds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of scallop/hush motifs builds to CR closure in hairpin embedding and girl-child birth, with conceptual cost of cycle's death demand legible in boy's dissipation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring scallop shell in cloud-crystal fuses with hairpin to charge final image; micro-setting of moon-ash and grotto constrains climb/descent choices. Sensory bias (tannin smell, grape-cooled air) filters through caretaker's vineyard lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contentment source) deepens via boy/hairpin visions narrowing escape to descent; agency in stabbing pin anchors pressure with sap-sealed lifeline cost. Grotto tremble forces trade-off without resolving via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final valley exhale reconfigures forgiveness/debt as heartbeats, resonant non-literal answer to upward chase; cycle emerges from particulars like ivy names without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable POV with perceptual signature in scallop/vineyard diction; boy's sparse dialogue ("I am the next you") carries subtext advancing revelation. Rhythm modulates from hush to harvest-bell ring under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful scallop recurrence, but figurative layering ("knees scallop inward") borders overload in memory beat without obscuring propulsion. No loops; rhythm varies for ascent cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mythic vineyard-cycle synthesis with hairpin-shell fusion feels inevitable; scallop motif transforms forgiveness trope boldly without gimmick.</comment>
