<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when she tries to stop writing but the "earnestly studious part" persists, earning her heavier heart with visible cost in the final descent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase (bonsai rustles textures) culminating in CR closure: paper glider ignites, trees grow full-sized, reweighting invented histories as real with notepad/heart cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bonsai labyrinth and lamp constrain choices (rearrange path, hum dictates) and charge final image (roots crack stone, canopy lifts), with sensory textures (moss luminescence, C-sharp hum) perfectly selective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect textures without exhausting longing) deepens via her dictating pencil scratches narrowing options; agency in launching glider forecloses caution with heart-heavier cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of desire-pruned history emerges organically; final ash-snow fertilizing trees offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in texture-obsessed noticing (velvet of 1912, grit of 2077); rhythmic control heightens pressure in hum-rising climax without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (light refracting, hum as Morse) propels without loops; peak transformation beat flows read-aloud with varied syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forgery-made-real via sentient bonsai risks poetic density that heightens stakes, feeling inevitable in glider-ignition turn.</comment>
