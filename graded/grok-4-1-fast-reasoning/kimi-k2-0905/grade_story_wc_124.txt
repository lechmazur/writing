<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in embodied grief ("floral gravity collapsing his chest") acting simultaneously with caution, earning final transformation to scent broker; micro-choices like pouring the drop reveal values with cost. No stock phrasing; voice particular to broker's cataloguing instinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent density builds to CR closure in final inhale finding "forgiveness distilled," reweighting grief with felt emotional cost legible in orchid's new note and empty vial placement. Single scene anchored early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting (UV panels, fungi ducts) constrains choices like vial placement and charges final image of pulsing orchid; sensory hierarchy scent-dominant, filtered through Elian's caution, evolves causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grieve without uncorking sob) signaled early, tightens texturally via orchid resonance narrowing to acceptance; agency in drop-pouring forecloses fear path with cost in "ache" exchanged upward. Escalation coheres under lens without abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of smell as grief's time travel emerges organically from particulars like hospital bracelet scent; final image reconfigures to "cultivate extinct perfumes" without moralizing, resonant non-literal answer with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature scent-biased ("bright chains of molecules"); rhythmic modulation peaks in short, charged breaths under stress; purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via vivid images ("pollen glowing like galaxies"), rhythm varies read-aloud; figurative chains coherent in peak scent reveal without muddle, minor repetition of "aromatically cautious" voice-motivated, no loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of olfactory collapse world with extinct greenhouse transforms grief tropes; lantern-to-scent broker turn inevitable from particulars, risk-taking in sensory architecture heightens stakes organically.</comment>
