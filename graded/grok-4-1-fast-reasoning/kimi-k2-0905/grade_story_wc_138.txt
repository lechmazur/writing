<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vey's boredom as flaw drives pivotal bargain with technicians, earning the door-step renunciation with embodied cost in his cracking smile. Internal conflict between endless corridors and lover's goodbye shows contradictory impulses acting in the shard-vision beat. Minor genericism in technicians slightly dilutes relational crucible at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from fragment tug to shard merge to door threshold; CR closure lands on-page with Vey's "proceed" choice peeling time, cost legible in heart's hollow hush. Orientation anchored early in escondite/solar storm. No slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prismatic corridors constrain path via magnetic tug and folding space, charging final brighter/emptier image; solar plasma vermilion mirrors internal exile. Sensory hierarchy (choral colors, velvet thunder) reflects Vey's dimensional awareness without tourist catalog. Body/setting integration via heel-clink inciting incident elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end boredom via goodbye) signaled early, tightens via shard vision narrowing to door option with trade-off bargain; agency in leading mutiny path forecloses oversight. Cost felt in amulet transfer binding mortals' pilgrimage. Minor abstractness in mutiny threat slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of time-exile vs. finality emerges organically via goodbye echoes and door, resonant CR in "hush so complete it rang like thunder" reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in Vey's smile cracking centuries layers ambiguity. No tidy resolution, embraces mortal-immortal complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV on Vey with clean final shift to mortals' felt stabilization; perceptual signature in dimensionally attuned noticing (Möbius sigh, polar hunger). Poetic rhythm modulates from hushed to thunderous cadence. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual in bargain, advances goal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric patterns (hush/thunder motif taught early, pays off in closure ring); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "solar ions braided through the lattice" slightly muddles one mid-beat, but closure image pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi station with mythic amulet compulsion transforms immortal boredom trope into goodbye-door CR. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmick, inevitable in hindsight via magnetic progression. No derivative echoes.</comment>
