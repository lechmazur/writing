<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied grief via reciting primes under breath instead of crying reveals contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final endurance of ambiguous loss earned through ritual micro-choices with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as ritual densities build from eye placement to seedlings harvest; closure as conceptual repricing lands on-page with persistent loss as undeniable cost in "ambiguous loss remained—no body, no farewell."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Calcite trunks and mosaic ridges constrain precise eye rotations and tree climb, charging final seedlings sprouting from liquid starlight image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ritual pressure tightens via pattern break when drop strikes eye, forcing astrolabe discovery and beam projection; dominant stake of resolving orchard silence reweighted by orchard renewal with live loss cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Integral sign cradling heart drips to seedlings, offering non-literal resonant answer to grief-as-equation premise, reweighting math-emotion synthesis without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in math-infused diction like "vectors of longing" and "locus of possible intersections" modulates rhythmically to charged poise at "interval between drop and stone."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with metaphors coherently integrated (e.g., "tectonic plates of turquoise memory"); varied syntax propels without loops, climaxing in flawless "mathematics of emotion finally summing to motion."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass eyes projecting heart-integral via fossilized orchard synthesizes loss-ritual in fresh, inevitable math-magic hinge; risk of poetic compression heightens closure without opacity.</comment>
