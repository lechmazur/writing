<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation in dance choices and contradictory exile impulse, with final transformation earned via rising pressure; interiority particular to tide dancer's rhythm without stock epiphanies. Minor abstraction in emotional layering slightly dilutes peak contradiction during inscription.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from circling fountain to dust sacrifice; on-page Conceptual Repricing closure ("she had become the forbidden memory") lands with conceptual cost of emptied self, constraint of dawn legible in "sunrise would seal the ink if she faltered."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden's moss, dew, and dry fountain constrain dance and charge final spiraling footprints; sensory hierarchy (taste of "obsidian grace," feet printing absence) filters through dancer's bias, mirroring internal exile without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to inscribe memory tightens texturally via faster dance and dimming dust, forcing trade-off in final grain sacrifice; cost unmistakable in halted chest-heaving moment, agency in observing gaps narrows to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory in absence emerges organically from inscription process to final "skin sang verses only the tide could read," reweighting exile premise without moralizing; resonant counter-reading in stars' dancer shape lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in tidal metaphors and selective noticing (gaps in cricket hush); rhythmic syntax modulates intensity from spirals to peak "speaking the language of undertow," no distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "soles printing absence into dew" advances action/atmosphere); figurative consistency in lunar/tidal pattern avoids muddle, but occasional overload in inscription beat ("silver lines...absorbed it") borders opacity under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dance-as-memory inscription post-ban transforms exile trope, with skin-fledging risk heightening stakes; inevitable hindsight in dust-to-verse progression feels non-obvious and voice-organic.</comment>
