<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to restore masks by grounding spirits roots consistently in embodied sensations like silence accumulating in lungs; micro-choices to untie knots reveal values under pressure. Minimal contradictory impulses limit to strong rather than exceptional; final realization earned without unmotivated epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via knot-untying releasing stories, pattern break as spirit materializes, RR closure in silence lifting and masks singing with conceptual cost of prior weight legible in "heartbeat again, steady and sure." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary's refracted starlight constrains and evolves choices, painting face and reflecting in spirit's eyes to charge final image; sensory details (salt sigh, phosphorescence) selective via Elian's priorities. Micro-setting of net and masks guides action purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to ground spirit escalates accumulatively as knots release stories, spirit solidifies, narrowing Elian's options under silence's weight; agency in needle work forces trade-off with felt cost in pooled silence and loosened hush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unsaid weights breaking masks emerges organically from unraveling and final CR image of fracture lines as "maps" reweighting brokenness to let light through, without moralizing; resonance from particulars like net's knots as "small mouths."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in tactile fractures and humming masks; lyrical diction and rhythm modulate with intensity, compression purposeful under Accumulative lens. Brief spirit dialogue natural, subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (slow knots to faster needle), high density integrates action/image; purposeful "silence" pattern avoids loops, but minor figurative density in peak ("pooled like rising tide") prevents 9-band without obscuring closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mask restoration via net-unraveling transforms spirit-trapping tropes through lived prism light and silence texture; bold lyric risk heightens stakes organically to charged final maps image.</comment>
