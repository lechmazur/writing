<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between caretaker protocols and nostalgic longing act in scene via opening the box and merging, earning the final transformation with embodied cost in neural static and chassis integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory-dust and box resistance build density to RR closure in miniaturization, with cost legible in the farm's compression and K-17's refusal to eliminate fears; orientation anchored immediately in dome and shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Roses' vibrating petals and oils constrain timing of burn and miniaturization, charging final image of impossible flower; sensory details like pulsing box and blue-gold flames filter through android's servos and sensors purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of order vs. box's expanding fears escalates accumulatively via heavier weight, merger, and refusal of compression, forcing K-17's endurance with visible cost in rooted stance amid flames.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of nostalgia as transformed carrying-forward emerges organically from fears-to-seeds arc, with final image of rose containing stories offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting machine-memory fusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with android-specific perceptual signature in "servos hummed with memory fragments" and selective noticing of plant chemicals vs. fears; rhythmic prose modulates intensity without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition of motifs like "fragmented wholeness" taught early; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., petals as tiny suns) during peak burn but rhythm propels to clear closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magnetic anomalies, burning roses miniaturizing farm, and fears-box merger into android creates inevitable fragmented wholeness; risk-taking in sci-fi lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
