<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in twitching charcoal fingers and nail-cracking strokes compel the shift from curse to collaboration; final clean fingers earn the change with visible cost. Interiority particular via mnemonic specificity avoids stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (rose light, iron air) builds to crystal growth along her lines and lock repricing (4-7-9 to 9-7-4), landing Charged Poise closure in fused portrait burst with emotional cost of release legible in tears and reset lock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal facets pulsing rose light and gypsum ledge constrain drawing choice, growing along lines to charge final fused image; sensory hierarchy (low chord for exiles, wet pennies) filters through artist's mnemonic bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rectifying mnemonic curse tightens via cave's responsive growth and lock's autonomous shift, narrowing to collaborative fusion; cost felt in cracking nails and suppressed laughter's uncorking, though single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of callings as tunnels emerges implicitly from drawing's mineral rescue and voices' ricochet, reweighted in final handing of blank sheets without moralizing; dates bending like crystal (4-7-9 to 7-4-9) offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (every eyelash exact, strokes as mnemonic missions) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from rattling heart to spiraling harmony under pressure, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with metaphors coherent around crystal/memory growth (auroral sorrow bleeding like dawn); rhythm varies for propulsion, minor "auroral" reprise purposeful without loop, though figurative density borders overwriting in peak drawing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mnemonic curse and responsive geology transforms artist trope, with lock's laugh-release and crystal collaboration inevitable from established pattern; bold lyric risk heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
