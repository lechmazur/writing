<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and earned arc from avenger to penitent, with flaws complicating choices; final micro-choice to write in own shaky script reveals values with cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "treason against her own humanity" abstracts peak realization slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory density builds to CR closure: blood-written confession and leaving thorn reprice vengeance as self-prison, with legible emotional cost in abandoning talisman. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sanctuary's marble, dripping stalactites, and fading aurora constrain acts (palm press, floor writing) and charge final image of shadow across refuge-turned-witness. Sensory selection POV-biased to memories, purposeful without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renounce vengeance via forgiveness) signaled early; accumulative deepening via thorn-prick and key-insight narrows options, forcing agency in confession-writing with visible cost of shaky self-script over forgery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of unfinished stories emerges organically through thorn/key reprise shifting from vengeance to self-truth; final image resonates without moralizing, though written line "we are all incomplete stories" borders echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature tuned to symbolic memories; rhythm modulates from heavy reflection to lighter emergence, diction character-specific without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive loops in "calibrated treason" (4x), "heritage rose thorn" (6x), and "wisely enduring" (3x) create paraphrase churn dulling mid-section propulsion; dense figuration coherent but overwrites high-reflection beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forger forgiving via own-hand script transforms trope of vengeance cycle; thorn-to-truth and key-for-heart symbols risk poetic density but heighten closure organically.</comment>
