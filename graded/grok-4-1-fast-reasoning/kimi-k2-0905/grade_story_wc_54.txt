<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Alya's motivation roots in engineering traits, with micro-choices like rerouting glycol earning her inward realization; embodied stoic wonder shines in "taste of brass and glycol." Minor slip: no simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak resurrection beat, idealizing competence slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to Charged Poise closure; orientation anchored early ("abandoned spaceport passenger terminal"). Cost legible in final pocketed shard as "portable meridian pointing...inward," reconfiguring escape to repair.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via "hydraulic arteries" and "choked filters," charging closure ("brass birds to patrol an empty cathedral that finally had a heartbeat"). Engineer bias filters details like "rust...into Martian vermillion"; vivid, purposeful sensory weave.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resurrect hope via equations) tightens accumulatively through glycol success to drone/fountain activation; agency in welds/improvisations forecloses outward escape. Cost felt in elders' "unsolvable" vs. endured inward vectors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation emerges organically from sextant mappings to "vectors pointing inward"; subtext in spinning coin/fountain arc offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Final image reweights "maze of intentions" with reclaimed wonder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in fluid dynamics metaphors ("Pressure times area equals possibility"); rhythmic control modulates stoic wonder under rising pressure. Hologram's clipped subroutines distinguish voice cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; figurative layering ("valves frozen in attitudes of prayer") taught early as lyric pattern, pays off without muddle. No loops; minor density risk in peak beats coherent to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spaceport mausoleum with engineering poetry transforms tropes; risk in dense lyricism heightens inward reconfiguration. Sextant as "makeshift stylus" for hope equation inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
