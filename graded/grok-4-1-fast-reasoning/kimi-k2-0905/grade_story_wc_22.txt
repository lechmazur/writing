<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Coachman's interiority shines in embodied details like dead languages "humming inside his ribs like bees" and tongue bleeding under pressure, driving micro-choices from gull dialogue to pod selection; contradictory impulses emerge in fluent dead tongues versus living silence; earned change in carriage's new purpose feels compelled by ritual costs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-taught ritual building to RR closure in garden conquest and "dead languages quiet inside him"; orientation anchors immediately via coachman at jetty; cost legible in "voice cracking... tongue bled" and battlefield exhale, reconfiguring options without micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Blooming jetty and water constrain choices (kneeling at roots, seeds diving to metal); sensory hierarchy via coachman's bias (salt flowers, iron blood) evolves causally with flowers climbing pilings; recurring feather and box charge final image; no white-room, vivid yet economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim battlefield) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening ritual density to tongue-bleed cost and vines wrapping bayonets; agency in scattering seeds and persistent speaking forecloses violence path; single tightening suffices, pressure coheres to Charged Poise in exhaling field.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of nature reclaiming violence emerges organically from seed ritual and treaty echo, reweighted in final grove swaying "like underwater kelp"; resonant CR in polyps stirring peace shape avoids moralizing; subtext in gull's verse and petal lanterns lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature (dead tongues, bird dialects); stable single POV filters through coachman's ancient fluency; rhythmic modulation peaks in cracked voice, purposeful compression taught early pays off in closure image; no head-hopping, diction biased and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "syllables settled like silt"), varied rhythm passes ear test; minor overwriting in figurative density during peak ("vines that wrapped around bayonets, blooming white flowers shaped outstretched hands") dings without obscuring closure; no loops, clean grammar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coachman-seeds-treaty transforms war-reclamation trope via trilobite tongues and bird concord; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, inevitable hindsight from "myrrh and gunpowder" pod to petal lanterns.</comment>
