<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zen-minded potter's micro-choices (shaping clay hive, aligning lantern) reveal hierarchy of calm vs. fractured visions, earning final understanding with embodied cost in pulse to tree; interiority concrete and particular without stock epiphanies. Contradictory impulses act in visionary scene, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: thrum density increases to visions, clay hive, lantern alignment for RR closure (timelines settle with oasis' fragile life/cost of eventual vanishing). Orientation anchored early in oasis/hives; pattern taught, no shards overreach.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Apricot tree constrains thumb-press choice and hive placement, lantern glass charges final gold-painting image; sensory hierarchy (honey-ash taste, bee-thrum vibration) POV-filtered and evolves causally to dew/bees. Satisfies 9+ test via setting-tool closure charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tend kindness to heal resisting oasis) signaled early, escalates via thrum-deepening visions narrowing to lantern alignment under Accumulative lens; agency in shaping/aligning forecloses fractured paths with conceptual cost legible in settling timelines. 9+ test met by agency-driven deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kindness-as-tending emerges organically from tree-pulse, unfired hive promise, to final memory-carrying; resonant non-literal answer in apricot fruit/jar covenant reweights resistance premise without moralizing. Satisfies 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (clay remembers, sun patterns in eyes); rhythmic lyric compression taught early, modulates to charged poise at lantern alignment without slippage. 9+ test met by signature under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short thrum beats to expansive visions); metaphors cohere (glazes/timelines, phototropic leaves) without muddle, propelling to closure image; zero loops/artifacts. 9+ test satisfied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh phototropic-kindness synthesis transforms timeline/wasteland tropes via potter's clay-hive kiln of mercy; risk-taking lyric shards heighten stakes, inevitable in hindsight at unfired hive murmur.</comment>
