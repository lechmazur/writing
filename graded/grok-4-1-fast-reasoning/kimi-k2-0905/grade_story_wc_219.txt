<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied spore visions ("scent of stove gas, creak of a stair") concretely reveal skeptical drive toward chemical homecoming, earning final renunciation; minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses (involuntary inhale resolved too smoothly) prevents flawless peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from amber pulse to spore dissolution and tower collapse as CR, with legible cost in erased footprints/path; orientation anchored crisply in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like "wet lichen and rust" and slick stairs constrain climb and trigger drop, charging final soil placement; POV-biased selection (chemistry over myth) integrates perfectly without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove return as reaction) tightens via spore deepening under Accumulative lens, forcing endurance with cost in collapsing tower foreclosing pilgrimage; agency in recorder activation and amber burial drives escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of homecoming as decay emerges organically from chemical visions to final "studying its decay," reweighting premise non-literally with conceptual cost; no moralizing, resonance from particulars like offworlders' "nostalgia’s isotope."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with scientific perceptual signature ("molecule," "isotope") modulates rhythmically under pressure, as in spore twitch to dissolution; purposeful poetic compression taught early enhances lyric closure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion ("tower began to collapse inward... like a lung exhaling") with varied rhythm and zero loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere physically, elevating closure image without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of offworlder nostalgia, amber spores as chemical map, and gentle collapse transforms sci-fi tropes via skeptic's lens; risk in abstract "reaction" payoff feels inevitable and heightens conceptual stakes.</comment>
