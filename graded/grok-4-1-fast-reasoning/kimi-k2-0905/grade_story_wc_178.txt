<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in fearful hesitation yielding to sharpened motivation tonight, embodied in heart beating with devotion and tears at prophecy; final oath and disappearance earn renunciation with conceptual cost of eternal silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as schematic density builds lattice projection to door reveal to chamber visions, culminating in CR closure via returned marginal notes as prophecy; cost legible in sworn guardianship foreclosing mortal life, on-page in kneeling oath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring lapis tile and palace elements (cedar doors, cracked lions, copper door) constrain choices like pressing tile to unbar sanctum and charge final empty scriptorium image; sensory selection (dust constellations, stone sigh) filters through astronomer's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to seal covenant tightens accumulatively via projection narrowing to forbidden door then chamber futures forcing oath; agency in tracing diagonal forecloses path with felt cost of self-erasure, unmistakable in disappearance reconfiguring options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of math outlasting empire emerges via tile symmetries revealing futures where Babylon endures in calculations; final image of lone magic square on tablet offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature in mathematical mysticism (numbers lifting into lattice, diagonals as corridors); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in chamber projections without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring dusky rhythm; figurative language purposeful in accumulative build (e.g., "dust floated like pale constellations") without muddle, though minor density in peak chamber visions prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic square unlocking Babylonian mysticism transforms trope via empirical irony and covenant; risk in reimagined palace geometries heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at prophetic notes reprise.</comment>
