<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in reopening the scar despite fear of sister's laugh; final seed-swallowing renunciation earned by telepathic buildup with embodied cost. Interiority particular via tastes (iron/lilac) and plant murmurs. No therapy-speak; flaws (guilt, avoidance) drive choices to closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (coffee rings to tunnel) builds to CR in seed-swallow reweighting miracle's premise with blood-cost. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (tower, dawn, wound). One tightening via osage's "Step" pays off at earthen jar break; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Coffee rings as micro-setting constrain tunnel choice, evolving from vigil stains to vertebral spine. Sensory hierarchy (meteor hush absorbs beeps) reflects post-anesthesia daze. Granite-to-loam shift mirrors internal softening, charging final seed on sill.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release miracle via fresh loss) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via plant guidance to wound-reopening agency; cost legible in blood drops as "syllable of apology." Narrows options from pretend time-inversion to real trade-off. Climax turn traces to protagonist's palm-pressure decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of scars-as sideways stories emerges via wound/roots stitching, reweighting premise non-literally in period-ending image without moral state. Subtext in laugh-replay layers guilt/relief ambiguity. Final plant whisper offers resonant answer to reading silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature (rust/morphine radicles, chlorophyll code) modulates with intensity; syntax reflects rooting mind. Stable POV distance heightens synesthetic immersion. No elision withholding; compression taught early via telepathy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "each brown rim a vertebra" advances image/causality). Rhythmic variety in short descent sentences accelerates; metaphors cohere (firefly jar to swelling light). Zero loops; opening anchors stakes poetically.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of serum-telepathy, miracle-soil, scar-reading transforms loss tropes; tunnel via coffee rings risks bold metaphor payoff. Premise implications followed to seed-home without retreat. Irreplaceable plant voices heighten stakes organically.</comment>
