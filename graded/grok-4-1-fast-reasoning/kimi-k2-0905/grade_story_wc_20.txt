<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses embodied in trembling hands during kintsugi mend; final calibration earned via prior micro-choices like folding tears with rust; no diagnostic speak flattens peak grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via four limits building density to CR closure—"the balance inside her finally quieted"—with legible cost in anchored coin and left-behind gold; orientation anchored in opening line; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Foundry micro-setting constrains via anvil, scales, molds (e.g., rust scraped for regret); sensory hierarchy alchemical—silver gutters, hissing steam—charges final image of glowing cracks; body/coin as setting mirrors internal rupture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem name) deepens accumulatively through limits, narrowing to coin's articulation; agency in sequential choices (weigh, calcine, mend); cost visible in tears adding twentieth ounce and emptied pockets.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of rupture-as-invitation emerges organically via coin's mend and equation "the weight of a name equals the love left over"; resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing; ambiguity in calibration lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with alchemical perceptual signature ("factually mystical objects"); rhythmic modulation peaks in hovering coin hush; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with coherent metaphors (mercury syllables, living gold) propels via pattern-taught limits; no loops, varied rhythm, but figurative density borders overwrite in second limit without harm to closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy, kintsugi, zodiac grief transforms tropes via factual-mystical coin; bold lyric risks heighten stakes in limit explorations, inevitable at "names are not chains but counterweights."</comment>
