<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory density (drips, clangs, slosh) builds to Conceptual Repricing closure in "wheel spinning slowly...measuring the new equilibrium," with legible emotional cost of bearable truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Beaded valve wheel as micro-setting constrains appraisal choices (hoist, roll, unscrew) and charges final spinning image, with sensory details (mineral stink, silt) filtered through skeptical POV.</comment>
