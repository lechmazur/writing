<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through sensory transformations like sharpened eyesight after monuments; embodied changes reveal character under accumulating pressure. Mild flaw: minimal contradictory impulses shown acting simultaneously, keeping it below 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of rising leaves and mounting monuments tightening to closure; moonstone release bursts into radiance lifting offerings to reveal mirror arbor, delivering CR with conceptual cost of relinquished memories.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ashen skyborne arbor vividly selective, leaves rising upward constrain choices by signaling imbalance; highest bough climb charges final image, with micro-setting of lichen and catwalks grounding surreal floating grove.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of restoring equilibrium signaled early, escalates accumulatively via spiraling leaves and communal monuments narrowing options; release forecloses individual holding of memories with felt communal cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of remembering forgotten things emerges organically through monument particulars shifting to mirror world reveal; final image reweights premise without moralizing, children's proverb as earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature of folklore-tinged noticing (root whispers, pollen spirals); rhythmic prose modulates hush-deepening tension, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in stacked figures like "soft thunder—each monument stood for something" slightly muddles peak clarity without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of upward leaves as prophetic dialogue and tiny monuments buoying skyborne grove feels inevitable; risk of lyric folklore world heightens stakes organically.</comment>
