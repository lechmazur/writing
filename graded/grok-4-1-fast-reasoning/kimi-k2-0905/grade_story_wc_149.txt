<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ghost bride's lovingly venomous visitations embody contradictory impulses (hover tenderly, yet curse via bead); boy's shift to mournful elation and fruit-picking earns closure choice, with orchard's withering as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: nightly cameos tighten via bead's pulse, culminating in thread-snapping RR/CR where greenhouse dissolves into petals—cost legible in withered trees and her solidified feet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Alchemical trees' rune-etched silver-to-gold fruit constrain repayment ritual, pulsing with her passes and charging final withering image; endless night ends with dawn, mirroring debt resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant debt stake escalates accumulatively through bead's accelerating thrum and boy's aluminum coat; rejection of wrist-blood forces fruit-pick, foreclosing path with orchard sacrifice as unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of debts-as-vines-to-gifts emerges via bead-seed arc; final image of boy with warm seed offering future apricots provides non-literal repricing, reweighting curse with forgiveness and spring sadness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person ghostly focalization with ethereal perceptual signature ("veil trailing like smoke"); voice modulates rhythm from broken bells to forgiving smile, dialogue sparse but subtextual ("Debt is a vine").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("bead thrummed louder, answering"); coherent metaphors (vine, heartbeat) avoid muddle, varied syntax accelerates to closure without loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-debt trope via alchemical fruit-currency and bead-heart surgery; bead-to-seed synthesis feels inevitable, bold endless-night crucible heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
