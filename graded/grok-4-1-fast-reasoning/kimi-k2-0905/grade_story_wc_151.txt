<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through embodied hesitation (pressing clipboard to chest), with contradictory impulses (send confession vs. unsigned) acting in final choice; earned stasis in renunciation feels character-particular. Minor reflective summary ("first time she had signed a fake name") anchors to present but borders BRR limit without fully tilting a micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chalk spiral and letter density builds to RR/Charged Poise closure ("slipped the unsigned letter... choosing to remain unread") with legible conceptual cost (erasing self-map) in final image. Orientation anchored early (first paragraph); one tightening via early drone whir narrows options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (lavender shadows, honeyed beams, copper wings) filtered through POV urgency; chalk and arcade slot constrain choices and charge erasure in closure image. Micro-setting (flagstones, postal slot) guides tactile actions without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decide letter before drone) signaled early, tightens via early arrival whir forcing trade-off; agency in sending unsigned forecloses false recognition path with felt cost (pocketed confession). Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens but lacks deeper knowledge shift beyond time pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (anonymity as protection/imprisonment) emerges organically from chalk gateway and letter choice, resonant non-literal answer in "meaning lived... in the act of mailing itself" reweighting pseudonyms. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in unsent pocket letter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (noticing dust motes as planets amid hesitation); rhythmic modulation builds lyric texture without head-hopping. Purposeful elision of name enhances stakes, paid off in unread choice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in peak (drone shadow crossing spiral), but patterned repetition ("codes in children's sidewalk chalk" x3, "ebony clipboard") borders loop without full pattern-teach, and mixed metaphors ("fireflies" for neon) slightly muddle in mid-beats. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of futuristic nostalgia (2080s neon at dawn arcade) with pseudonym arc transforms mail trope into conceptual stakes; chalk-envelope symbol risks bold lyricism, heightening closure ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
