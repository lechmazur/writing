<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied details like "soft mechanical tick inside my ribs" and contradictory refusal to flatline, earning the final sharing of wisdom with visible cost in leaving before dawn; micro-choices like slicing digital film reveal values hierarchy. Flawless under pressure, no label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ink fractals building to Conceptual Repricing closure—"failure is not the opposite of success; it is the corridor"—with cost in heartbeat 98,001 and unmatched footprints; orientation anchored early in observatory under snow; single-shard poetic progression tightens meaningfully without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Opal observatory dome and inkwell constrain defragment ritual and charge final descent; snow's Morse "stay, stay, stay" mirrors internal stakes tactilely; sensory hierarchy (frosted glass, razor cold air) reflects ghost-to-flesh urgency, no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to fetch wisdom before dawn signaled early, escalates accumulatively through ink map tightening to flesh-reassembly and clerk confrontation; agency in drawing new ring forecloses ghost path with cost in "fresh ring I drew"; one decisive deepening suffices, pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of failure as corridor emerges organically from ink rings of choices to final "error and miracle share a border," reweighting premise without statement; resonant non-literal answer in horizon walk avoids moralizing, complexity in clerk's tears lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct cyber-lyric voice ("ride the Wi-Fi like wind") with perceptual bias (echocardiogram logs, defragment glyphs) stable in first-person; dialogue sparse but rough/subtextual ("Your mistake gave me midnight solace"); rhythm modulates to charged poise at "static crackles down my spine."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "dendrites of regret" serving accumulative pattern without muddle; rhythm varies (short punchy heartbeat counts vs. flowing ink splay); minor figurative density in ritual risks overwrite but coheres and propels to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise of paperwork-glitch undead defragging via ink transforms ghost tropes ingeniously; fresh synthesis in heartbeat-tick porcelain resonance feels inevitable; risk-taking in poetic cyber-folk horror heightens stakes organically.</comment>
