<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied grief (voice muffled by water and grief) and contradictory impulses (almost lied to boy) compel the private lesson and link handover; flaws like persistent surface longing complicate without hedging. Boy applies immediate pressure via question, revealing his own motivation. Minor label phrasing ("balancedly curious") feels slightly stock but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from class demo to spire lesson, tightening to boy's sighting as Charged Poise/CR with legible cost in "hollow that ached like lungs remembering air" and missing link void. Orientation anchored early (benthic city, instructor). One deepening via alien craft confirmation suffices; closure reconfigures navigation premise without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Benthic details (biolum plankton, basalt amphitheater, water-shimmer sextant) constrain choices (grinding link on stone, spire for leaked starlight) and charge final image (towers as silhouettes, pale green mist). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (navigation pro notices alien angles matching shells). No white-room; evolves causally (city dims as craft passes).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigate twisted stars for possible return) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via boy's question forcing private endurance test; agency in grinding link, tracing angles till "fingers bled rust." Cost visible (trembling boy, bled fingers, foreclosed lie). Escalation coherent under lens, charging poise at "path" sighting without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (navigation as refusing disappearance) emerges organically from chain link motif shifting to "perfect, navigable void"; final image ("thin smile" amid ache) offers non-literal answer reweighting alien premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences (no lie to boy) and irony (stars wandered, yet hope via edges). Complexity lingers in unresolved return.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (angles as horizons/knives); lyrical diction ("somber marvel") modulates rhythmically under pressure, taught early as pattern. Dialogue subtextual ("learning is the only direction left"), distinct (instructor's muffled grief vs. boy's whisper). Clean free indirect; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (image advances beats, e.g., spinning link as "slow planet"); rhythm varies, read-aloud strong. Minor overwrite density (metaphors in most class lines) but pattern-taught for accumulative texture, coherent without muddle. Slight motif loop ("somber marvel" x3) purposeful, not scaffold; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: edge geometry nav in folded-space benthic world transforms tropes (aliens, lost surface) via chain link's evolving sextant role; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes (hope amid grief). Turn at craft glide confirms method organically; no derivatives, inevitable hindsight.</comment>
