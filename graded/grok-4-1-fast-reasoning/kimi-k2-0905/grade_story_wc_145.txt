<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the descent (editor's instinct to annotate vs. releasing the page), earning the final smile and new map with personal cost of defying the Registry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern density (spirals, river words) to CR closure in the refrozen lake and classified map, with cost in ephemeral transmission and return to myth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice crack's impossible warmth and ribbed shaft constrain descent choice and charge final spiral frost image, with sensory details (chime, glow) integrated purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to witness origins escalates via falcon trail to estuary discovery, driven by Maren's agency in speaking "mayu" and releasing page, with cost in foreclosed Registry data.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of linguistic origins/convergence emerges organically from unlocking ice and glowing words, resonant in final image of rivers stitching seams without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pattern-noticing (condensation spirals, star charts) with rhythmic control modulates beautifully under descent pressure, POV stable and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; no loops or muddled metaphors, even in peak estuary glow projecting the map upward.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic cartography and polyglot rivers transforms tropes organically, with bold underground estuary payoff feeling inevitable.</comment>
