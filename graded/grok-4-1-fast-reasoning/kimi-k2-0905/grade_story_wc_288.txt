<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the seductive chorus versus singular edges, with the refusal earned via the sternum crack widening to an interior sky; micro-choices like stepping off stones reveal values hierarchy with felt cost. No stock phrasing; voice particular to gryphon scholar.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as vibrations accumulate memories into chorus pressure, culminating in Charged Poise RR (refusal scatters shards, rotates sundial to etch "Alone") with legible cost in foreclosed partnership; orientation anchored instantly, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal library's salt-crystal shelves and stone circle constrain choices (protocol to step on humming stones) and charge final image (highest shelf codex); sensory details (moon-drawn breath, bass throb) selective via gryphon bias, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation to independence) signaled early, tightens via hum's chorus offer forcing refusal that narrows options; agency in wing-spread scattering and sundial rotation, with cost felt in brittle fissures—escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of alchemizing isolation emerges organically from refusal and interior sky discovery, final codex-page-as-moon offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting absence as coexistence without moralizing; earned via particulars like prismatic shards.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with gryphon perceptual signature (feathers ringing atomically, vibrations in hollow bones); rhythmic syntax modulates intensity (short beats in hum refusal, expansive in flight spirals), purposeful poetic compression taught early and legible at solo-drum closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with metaphors coherent under reflective-light pattern (e.g., feathers doubling moonlight into second sky); varied rhythm propels, no loops, but figurative density in peak refusal risks slight opacity without harming closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gryphon extinction with tidal library's absorbed ghosts transforms loneliness trope into brittle-to-resonant arc; risk-taking in lyric flight-maps and cloud-codex charges stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
