<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael's motivation as destitute philanthropist intensifies credibly through embodied actions like uncorking bugs and submerging arms, earning a change from purposelessness to tactile prophecy. Lira applies secondary pressure via her question, forcing reply amid quake. Minor slip: mosaic face epiphany leans abstract without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of orchestrated coincidences (bugs helix, persistent path, cave glass) builds density to CR closure where transformation reconfigures destitution with lingering texture cost on fingertips. One tightening via lava tremor forces detour, narrowing to cave submersion. Orientation anchored early in beach/who/when; cost legible in "texture... he could pass along by touch alone."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Volcanic setting constrains choices (lava hisses inland, goat path endures, glass walls yield like skin) and charges final black-glass staircase/orchids sprouting from footprints. Sensory hush/glow/smells filter through Kael's tactile bias. Mirrors internal mosaic in cave shards whispering "texture."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose via transformation) signaled early, tightens texturally via mounting coincidences culminating in cave wade that cradles/scrapes. Agency in releasing bugs, grabbing Lira, submerging earns descent with cost in redefined pockets. Coincidences complicate without resolving under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of giving/becoming as textured medium emerges organically from glass-skin yield, lava-steps, lingering fingertips without statement. Final bottle corked "not to capture but to carry" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in tactile/glow/hush diction; rhythm modulates from whispering to vibrant hush. Lira's one line ("transformation hurt as much as the silence") carries subtext fitting childlike curiosity. No head-hopping; voice peaks purposefully in cave.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (hush/light helix/glass skin) taught early, propels without loops. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors during cave submersion but coherence holds, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of destitute giver's volcano wade into skin-medium transforms tropes; bugs/orchids/prophecy helix feels inevitable, risking poetic density that heightens stakes.</comment>
