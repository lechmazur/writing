<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions (forgiveness as "hoarfrost forming" vs. past "smashed organ"), earning the ritual choice; flaw of guilt complicates until shed with cost in tears freezing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to CR closure ("preservation is not a bronze bell but a continuing vibration"); cost legible in "lighter by the weight of guilt, heavier by the cargo," with no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ice and aurora constrain choices (warming strands with palms) and charge final image (glacial wind carries voices); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (bronze effigies to breath).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to preserve names tightens texturally via rope reconfiguration, forcing agency in threading perforations; cost unmistakable in frozen tears and card's dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of vibration over ownership emerges organically, repriced in final tasting of names without moralizing; punched card reprise reweights fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (effigies vanishing in flame to names in snowflakes) with rhythmic modulation; stable first-person elides nothing unearned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but minor figurative density in opening ("frost-lensed skylight") borders overwrites without obscuring ritual peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of organ card and ritual rope transforms preservation trope; risk in lyric compression inevitable at "sound unfolded... braided into harmonics."</comment>
