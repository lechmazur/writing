<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in face-blindness as mercy/curse act simultaneously in the blood-smeared ribbon revelation, earning the final portrait choice with trauma cost; interiority concrete via micro-braids memory. Detective's late entry applies pressure without muddying POV. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of charcoal/mist/ribbon builds to CR closure in portrait completion, reweighting face-blindness with relived trauma cost legible in "crack of stone on bone." Orientation anchored early in quarry/caution tape; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Quarry mist/body/ribbon constrain choices (soaks page, lamp gutters timing revelation) and charge final exhale image; sensory hierarchy (cedar/copper smell) reflects methodical POV bias. Micro-setting as lived crucible elevates to 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken empathy) signaled early, tightens via blood unification narrowing oblivion options; agency in palm-slice forecloses face-blind mercy with embodied convulsion cost under accumulative lens. Quarry pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of opposites unification emerges organically from blood-silk/hair collision, resonant CR in "evidence that doesn’t burn" reweighting without moral; epiphany earned via particulars, ambiguity in quarry exhale lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (methodical lines as lances/surgery); rhythmic modulation peaks in "empathy convulsed awake," eliding backstory via ribbon cue per BRR. Voice texture distinct, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (mist halos advance drawing beat); figurative pattern (lance/surgery/convulsed) taught early, coherent without muddle in peak blood moment. Minor density in metaphors caps below 9+; zero loops/scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Blood-ribbon ritual transforms face-blind trope into fresh empathy premise; risk in opposites method heightens stakes organically, inevitable hindsight in portrait as treaty. Non-obvious synthesis without echoes.</comment>
