<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vespers' micro-choices like singing the lullaby backwards and swapping the bishop reveal a consistent motivation rooted in wonder, with embodied tension in her "sacredly playful" stance during the climax. Halcyon's revealed fear of heights creates ironic pressure without stereotypes. Interiority emerges through actions rather than direct contradiction, but final renunciation (passing the sundial) feels earned with visible cost in empty pockets.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, image density builds from shadows-as-doorways to the board tilting via swap, culminating in Charged Poise CR as the child opens the lid and stairs carve anew—reweighting wonder as eternal cycle. Cost legible in "spire shuddered, beginning its slow collapse" and "pockets empty... certainty." Orientation anchored early; structure holds as ascent-descent shards with legible transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring sundial lid constrains the climax shadow stair and charges the final passing image. Sensory details like "notes freezing into tiny bells" and "auroras writhing like hooked fish" filter through Vespers' wondrous POV, pressuring climb and game. Atmosphere coheres, evolving causally with sky convulsions mirroring internal stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (amend Halcyon's hoarded truths via wonder) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through secret-whispers and bishop swap narrowing options, forcing Halcyon's hesitation-to-step agency. Escalation coheres under Textural lens via density to sky-yawn climax; cost visible in his white knuckles and spire's fall foreclosing rule.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder over certainty emerges organically from chess secrets and shadow stairs, reweighted in final "chess piece rolled... perfect zero" as non-literal answer to locked truths dancing. Subtext in implications like "steal only what people no longer dare to keep" avoids moralizing, embracing ambiguity in crooked sky seams.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (shadows as doorways, tasting colors) modulates rhythmically from ascent propulsion to charged poise at "arms wide, boots skimming." Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, e.g., Vespers' line pursues goal; no head-hopping, voice lyric-coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figuratives (e.g., "sky stitched... crooked seams") taught early as Textural mode, propelling via varied rhythm—no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in peak beats like "auroras writhing like hooked fish" strains slightly without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thief/chess tropes via secret-swaps and "fall upward" teaching, with risk-taking poetic ascent/descent cycle heightening stakes. Turn at carved bishop feels inevitable from pattern; final zero-image transforms premise non-obviously.</comment>
