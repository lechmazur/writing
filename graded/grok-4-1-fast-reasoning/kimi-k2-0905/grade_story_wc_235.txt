<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in adding to the scroll despite envy of past selves, earning the final endurance of chronicling with embodied cost in "chaos inside her settle into something almost bearable." Interiority concrete via feral nostalgia bite and jealousy flare; micro-choices like scraping soot reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density tightens from scroll to dissolving in snow, landing Conceptual Repricing where erasure reconfigures time-as-wheel with felt cost in "snowflakes landed like white ink, dissolving the words." Orientation anchored by cabin/scroll in opening lines; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moonlight "slicing the snow into blue glass" and dissolving snowflakes charge final image, constraining choice to lay scroll outside; sensory details like "cedar smoke" and "wind like a page turning" filter through POV, mirroring internal chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of chronicling amid time confusion escalates texturally via jealousy and grave-scroll loop, forcing renunciation of tidy narrative when scroll dissolves, with unmistakable cost in foreclosed certainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of dissolving scroll offers resonant answer to time-as-wheel question, reweighting stories as futile yet necessary mapping without moralizing; feral nostalgia emerges organically from particulars like eroded name.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "chronologically confused" lens and rhythmic compression under stress (e.g., sparks "write brief constellations"); stable single-POV with prose syntax reflecting jaded wonder.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with no loops; figurative language like "mouth open like a broken shutter" purposeful and pattern-taught early, propelling to closure without muddle or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream chronicler grappling feral nostalgia transforms time-loop trope via scroll's erasure continuation; risk in lyric time-folding heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
