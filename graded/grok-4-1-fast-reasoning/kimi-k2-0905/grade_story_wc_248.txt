<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ember's motivation roots deeply in grandmother's promise and pyromania's duality, shown through concrete micro-choices like tracing walls and overlaying sketches; internal conflict between destruction and revelation acts simultaneously in the descent and climax. Transformation to preserver feels earned by causal trail-following with archive collapse as cost. Flawless embodiment avoids labels, but minor safety-hedging in tidy resolution nicks peak band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of artistic clues builds density to CR closure where tapestry reweaves, reweighting premise with conceptual cost (archive's purposeful collapse). Orientation anchors early (Ember in archive post-3 months). Single continuous scene with meaningful deepening via fragment discovery; no micro turns disrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (soot, lavender/sulfur, warm threads) selective and POV-biased toward fire/art, constraining descent (crumbling archway, false wall) and charging final image (tapestry glow mirroring internal shift). Atmosphere tensions destruction/preservation without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (tapestry as tool/object) evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue promise) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via deepening revelations (cipher overlays, "fire remembers"); agency in decoding/pressing fragment forecloses destructive path with visible cost (collapse). No reversal needed under lens, but abstract initial stakes materialize slowly, limiting entry to 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of destruction-as-preservation emerges organically from fire images shifting meaning (burning libraries false, real archive hidden); final CR reweights without moralizing. Subtext in scratched eyes/vandalism implies complexity. Minor drift to platitude in closing lines ("sometimes we must destroy to truly save") prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (fire/art lens on world); voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating intensity (tender tracing amid descent). No dialogue. Purposeful repetition ("volcanic tenderness") taught early as motif without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dense info lines advance via image/action, but overwriting in peak (repeated "volcanic tenderness," metaphor stacks like "burning bright in the volcanic tenderness") creates minor coherence drag and template cadence in reflective beats. Rhythm varies, but paraphrase loops (artistic trail recaps) dull propulsion. Clean mechanics otherwise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist trail of chemical-burned art decoding to preservation twist transforms trope organically. Risky poetic frame heightens stakes without gimmick; irreplaceable cipher mechanics feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
