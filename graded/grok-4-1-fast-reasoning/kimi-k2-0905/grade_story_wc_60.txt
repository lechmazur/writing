<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's skepticism yields to acknowledgment at the Unkept Promises fountain, where her own broken promise surfaces, earning the shift to speaking to the box with embodied cost in dissolved shards.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: breadcrumbs accumulate memories across fountains, tightening to self-realization and release; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands in memories rising like steam, reweighting regrets with emotional cost in the geese's resumption.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fountains (Lies, Goodbyes, Promises, Forgiveness) constrain path and charge memories; water-to-glass/mirrors filter POV, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism, pivotal in vibrating box at Promises.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate memories) signaled early, escalates via density of revelations narrowing to self-accountability; agency in following/speaking/opening forecloses denial, cost legible in emptied box and shifted silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of familial abandonment emerges via particular memories, resonating in final image of dissipating memories and geese flight offering non-literal release without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with luminous perceptual signature (light breadcrumbs, humming box); rhythmic prose modulates from skeptical observation to charged release, consistent idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm without loops; purposeful lyricism like "sidereal patience" avoids overwriting, propels via integrated images, clear in peak release beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of paused time, memory-box constellation, and promise-fountains transforms abandonment trope; risk in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightens closure.</comment>
