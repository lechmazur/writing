<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Eclectic pacifist traits embodied in coat patches and intuitive labeling of silences compel the climax press of clasp to sternum, earning reconfiguration with tears as felt cost; contradictory locking impulse vs. listening yields visible renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as tuning densities deepen silences toward CR closure ("Silence That Lets the World Speak Without Killing"); cost legible in clasp's warming expansion and chest-door image reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Workshop's sawdust/gunpowder and radio/cracked radio constrain tuning choices, charging final open doors image; skylight constellations mirror internal bruises without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to catalog silences tightens texturally via frequency revelations narrowing to forgiveness note before fireworks deadline; agency in dial twists forecloses hiding path with emotional cost in tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Empathy path emerges implicitly from silence varieties to clasp-as-tuning-fork realization; final broadcasting image reweights war bruises non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice sustains perceptual signature (textures as truce/surrender) with rhythmic modulation under tuning pressure; stable close-third POV biases toward hidden waves.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("Tears arrived without percussion") without loops; figurative coherence in peak tuning holds pattern without muddle touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio-tuning silences transforms pacifist recovery into empathy lighthouse; risk in lyric compression inevitable at clasp-sternum ring.</comment>
