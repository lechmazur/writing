<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's affectionate skepticism shines in her muttering to the geode, rooting motivation to help victims; internal conflict via suppressed somatic memories yields earned change without stock epiphanies. Minor slip in quick crystallization of motivation post-shock, but micro-choices like photographing patterns reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: static shock activates geode, therefore mappings lead to breakthrough shields with conceptual cost in healing recall chaos; Charged Poise closure in final workbench image reconfigures options legibly. Orientation anchored early in studio; one tightening at dawn resonance suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Studio and geode sliver as micro-settings constrain choices—geode amplifies light, forces precise handling—and charge final image; sensory details like vibrating mica and aching teeth filter through Mira's priorities. Vivid, purposeful integration without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to restore privacy escalates via causal discoveries narrowing options (shock→patterns→dead zones→shields); agency in devising forces trade-offs like feverish nights, cost felt in Mrs. Chen's test. Tightening at dawn disrupts signals with legible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of science-intuition healing tech disasters emerges organically from geode mappings to shield success; final image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting hidden pathways without moralizing. Complexity in chaotic recall vs. precise patterns lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (mineral affection, somatic recall); voice texture via rhythmic syntax modulates intensity, e.g., teeth-aching vibrations. Minimal dialogue natural; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel momentum; "fractally precise" recurrence taught as pattern without loop penalty. Minor overwriting in light-dance descriptions, but no closure muddle or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Geode-telepathy synthesis transforms crystal tropes into fresh causal engine for shields; risk in fractal world-logic heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via static activation.</comment>
