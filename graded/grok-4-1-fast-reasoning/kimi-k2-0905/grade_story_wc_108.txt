<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Phobia embodied concretely in "knees already knocking" and climax choice to expose raw footage, earning final renunciation of hiding fear with visible cost; contradictory impulses act when giggle clamps throat yet he kneels to decrypt. Girl briefly pressures via fearless contrast. Minor label-speak in "phobia-ridden" but overridden by scene actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: DNA → library hunt → girl clue → shell discovery → whisper → projector DC that reconfigures escape options with exposure cost legible in guards' hesitation. Orientation anchored by ~100 words; single scene tightens once meaningfully at alcove. Closure DC on-page with "I slipped behind them, clutching the shell."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rusted library's iron shelves and roof holes constrain creeping and charge projector finale via "stars spilled through the holes"; tactile film cans as "vertebrae" mirror spine need. Sensory hierarchy via phobia narrows to creaks/giggles. Recurrent stars evolve from leak to extras in climax image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shell proof vs retirement) signaled early, causal escalation via girl/shell/guards forces agency in projector outwit that forecloses hiding with public vulnerability cost. One tightening at whisper narrows to "keep the trembling take." Guards test commitment visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vulnerability-as-power emerges organically via shell whisper "keep the take where your knees shake" shifting to self-voice at end, reweighting premise without statement; final stride offers non-literal answer. Complexity in phobia's dual role (weakness/power). No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature via film idiom ("stunt beats," "betray the frame," "unpaid extras") biases noticing; brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("secrets... listen scared"). Distance stable, modulates with phobia stress. Rhythmic control peaks in "three… two… one— / A child’s giggle."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "rusted library... groaned like an old prop ship" advances setting/voice); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops/artifacts. Figuratives purposeful (rust galaxies) without muddle in peak projector beat. Zero scaffold in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms switched-at-birth trope via stunt industry (shell as unedited take) into projector escape; fresh shell-whisper payoff and "trembling certainty" synthesis feels inevitable. Bold risk in vulnerability embrace heightens stakes organically.</comment>
