<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Retrocognition embodied as "tasted the hour it last refracted, every voice" drives choices like prying calcified shard amid mute pulse; contradictory curse/blessing yields earned forward-cast closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via shard-gathering density to Charged Poise closure; "edges kissed, fractures aligned" reconfigures coincidences with conceptual cost of "no fall is final."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pavilion's "moan between mourning and morning" evolves to "chord of cracked crystal," constraining Polaris alignment and charging rose light image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightens accumulatively through shard hunt, desert hush forcing trade-off; agency in "pried it free" narrows to rekindle cost in becoming prism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Refractions of one intention" non-literally answers coincidence question, reweighting child/mother deaths without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in "footprints later erased by salt wind" biases noticing; rhythmic control peaks in "splintering into colors that had no names anymore."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds, density in "thumping faintly, calling her back"; metaphors cohere without muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hush-shard muting desert transforms post-apoc tropes; mosaic risk of star-path shards inevitable to "new prism" reconfiguration.</comment>
