<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Thistle's meek-to-determined arc is earned through repeated actions, with motivation rooted in bartered exchange; lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, relying on poetic summaries like "quietly determined precision."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from silk discovery to seventh-night closure (RR via arches descending, cost in bartered understanding); orientation anchored early in first paragraph, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating arches and mine shafts constrain choices (lining walls, ladder to arches) and charge final image of grounded bridges; sensory details (azure moonlight, humming stone) selective and purposeful through Thistle's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax resilience to tame arches) signaled early, escalates accumulatively over seven nights to agency-driven tightening (ladder climb, silk knot); cost legible in foreclosed old forge life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of resilience from rubble emerges organically via motifs shifting meaning (silk from barter to arch-tamer); final image reconfigures bartered awakening without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with lyrical perceptual signature (noticing silk glow, moonlit defiance); rhythmic texture modulates consistently, no head-hopping or withholdings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Patterned repetition of motifs ("bartered awakening," "quietly determined") taught early serves lyric accumulation but creates paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "space between understanding and confusion"); overwriting muddles peak beats like ladder raise with stacked metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy tropes (floating rocks tamed by silk ladder) feels organic, risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes toward closure.</comment>
