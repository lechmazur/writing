<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in rejecting comfort, embodied in bottle's warmth and painful shadow reenactments; micro-choices like burying the bottle earn stasis with felt solvent-like hurt. Minor abstract philosophizing dilutes peak contradiction slightly, but flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from walking to lantern rituals, tightening at bottle's hunger forces rejection, yielding CR closure in final reimagining image with conceptual cost of kinetic memory over stasis. Orientation anchored early in Cove's bones; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via reed frames, newspapers, flagpole anchoring kites, charging final ash-spiral and dune cries; sensory hierarchy (sulfur-brine, paper drying) reflects alchemist's priorities, mirroring internal solvent pain without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of revival sans resurrection signaled early, escalates accumulatively via lantern performance hurt and bottle confrontation narrowing to renunciation; cost legible in "performance hurt" and defeated bottle, charging poise in ongoing ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of kinetic memory over bottled comfort emerges organically from particulars like phosphor ink recipe and scrolls; resonant CR in "burn your own memories and let the wind teach them to fly." Scroll's inked "Civilization is..." borders thematic echo, muting pure emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in alchemical diction ("retort," "distill vapor"); rhythmic control modulates from monologue to incantatory naming under pressure; stable first-person POV with purposeful compression pays off in charged final breath-architecture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "Light climbed... shadows reenacted" advances action/atmosphere); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds; purposeful metaphors consistent without muddle in peak bottle rejection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-alchemy reviving ghost town transforms tropes via lantern-kites and unsealed streets; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from initial wish.</comment>
