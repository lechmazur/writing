<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Carefully reckless trait shines in "pulse hammered, yet her hand remained steady," constraining actions amid resistance; final renunciation of ink well earned by paradox, with memory-only proof as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as symphonies density builds against resistance; Charged Poise closure in leaving glowing ink well reconfigures archive's agency with conceptual cost of her absence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake tightens accumulatively from chord-mapping to spoken restitution amid counter-melody; agency in promise and ink well forfeiture pays visible cost, foreclosing proof.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in "ink swirled, forming miniature galaxies" propels without loops; coherent metaphors fuse music/language without muddle in peak resistance beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Language-as-symphony premise synthesizes linguistics/music organically; ink well left behind risks bold transformation of restoration trope into archive's autonomy.</comment>
