<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ghost's motivation to stitch unraveling memory via encore compels escalating choices, embodied in tasting words like "iron curtain weights"; contradictory longing and regret act simultaneously as threads layer; final sharpening into young actor earned by prior weaving with visible cost of Lila's departure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as echo density reconfigures timeline; orientation anchored early in theater post-closing; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in "outline sharpened... endless encore" with conceptual cost of dimming orchard, constraint of coin shaping tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like "nicotia... chords of perfume that sounded... like distant violins" constrain choices via maze rearrangement and tingling soles; recurring quince tree charges final backward bloom image, mirroring internal nostalgia.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of luring possibility signaled early, tightens via layering echoes into "harmonies" that thicken ground, forcing endurance of fractured pasts; agency in tying thread forecloses unraveling with cost of Lila's flicker and departure legible on stage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of nostalgia luring possibility emerges implicitly from weaving particulars like thimble baton and leaf applause; final heartbeat condensation offers resonant reconfiguration without moral, reweighting despair into charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("citrine applause, indigo silence") biases noticing consistently; dialogue like “Still craving applause, Casper?” carries subtext and gold spirals; rhythmic control modulates from fractured ribbons to steady heartbeat under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with lines like "each step produced echoes that layered like harmonies" advancing texture and propulsion; figurative pattern taught early via synesthesia avoids muddle, though dense metaphors border overwriting in weaving beat; no loops, varied rhythm passes ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic timeline-weaving transforms ghost trope via coin's starlight hum and orchard's mourner-existence; fresh synthesis of theater nostalgia and fractal pasts feels inevitable in backward quince bloom, with risk-taking in perceptual fusion heightening closure.</comment>
