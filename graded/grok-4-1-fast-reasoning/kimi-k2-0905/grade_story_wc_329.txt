<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Calla's motivation intensifies through micro-choices like skipping heartbeats and playing backward, earning the final bow; embodied tension in "breathless pause that tasted of iron and apricot" reveals contradiction between knowing and acting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to RR closure in seed-shell fusion and orchard exhale, with cost legible in "pocket empty except for the echo"; orientation anchors instantly on sky-bridge, one tightening via statue hesitation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sky-bridge sways constrain advance, statues' copper ears swivel pressure choices; final lanterns path charges image, sensory hierarchy (clanking footfalls, apricot scent) selective via Calla's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken beauty) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via softer melody forcing statue eyelids to droop; agency in lullaby reversal narrows options, cost felt in risked detection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of organic escape from mechanism emerges via blossoms reversing gravity, reweighted in "statues rooted themselves as ordinary trees"; resonant CR in child finding seed without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases to musical echoes ("pulse meant to mimic heartbeat"); rhythmic control modulates intensity, prose texture distinct in tarnished-rust diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "glass parted like water"; figurative consistency (e.g., "hammock strung between stars") taught early, no loops dull climax uprooting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of violin-heart signaling and shell-molt memory transforms tropes; risk in backward lullaby heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via apricot reversal.</comment>
