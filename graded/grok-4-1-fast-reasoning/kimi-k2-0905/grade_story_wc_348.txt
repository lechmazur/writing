<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied grief (knees trembling, grief slipping like runoff) and contradictory impulses (workaholic refusal vs. creative atonement); final placement earned by polymer-river insights. Micro-choices reveal values hierarchy, like pocketing chrysalis with purpose. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ash loss to sculpture placement; mosaic shards (ravine→lab→return) taught early via braiding motif, legible transitions. Closure as Charged Poise in final placement and walking away, cost in empty pockets legible ("pockets empty"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Braided ravine micro-setting constrains insight ("tracing river foam patterns") and charges closure (sculptures on islands pulsing); sensory hierarchy (water slap, cicadas, shale skim) filtered through chemist bias. Final image recharges environment as instrument.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief to connection) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via ash theft→resin insight→placement; agency in synthesis/placement forecloses isolation with cost (letting go, not staying). One tightening sufficient; no slips touch peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from braiding polymers/river/memory; final image ("separation is only a temporary braid") reweights premise non-literally, resonant without moralizing. Particulars (chrysalis laugh, 440hz) charge counter-readings of loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (polymer synesthesia: "braid separation back into connection"); stable close-third POV, rhythmic modulation peaks at closure. No dialogue; purposeful compression taught via motifs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm (short insight sentences amid lyric flow); braiding metaphors consistent, no muddle/loops. Minor figurative density in lab scene integrated, no scaffold obscures closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer science, grief artifacts, river as instrument; risk-taking in mosaic transforms loss trope, inevitable hindsight ("resin would weave a lattice"). Bold, organic.</comment>
