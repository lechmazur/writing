<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority through somatic plant mappings against scars and scents; contradictory survival guilt versus continuation impulses act in micro-choices like inventing the freeze; final covenant endurance earned with visible cost in photo release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via anchors to RR closure in palm on resin-sealed tree and covenant speech; photo rip-off crystallizes before/after with felt cost of forfeiture; orientation anchored early in arboretum/cliff/dusk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Arboretum micro-setting constrains via thin soil paths, railing, resin-smeared pine that seals photo image and charges final palm-press; sensory hierarchy (salt/eucalyptus/resin) mirrors grief evolution without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of anchoring optimism in realism escalates accumulatively through freeze dissection and photo handling to renunciation; one tightening in wind-ripped photo forecloses clinging path with legible emotional cost in tears and inland turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-coastline emerges organically via tree/roots images shifting to "damaged yet upright"; resonant final image reconfigures pearl of stillness without moralizing, though "I think" articulations slightly overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature in botanical/somatic bias and lyrical rhythm modulating from wind's "tearing paper" to ember sky; stable distance heightens emotional beats without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and coherent metaphors (blast as "red chrysanthemum"); minor figurative density in freeze beat ("drone as heron") purposeful but borders overwriting without obscuring propulsion or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone-strike grief mapped to arboretum plants via somatic anchors transforms survival tropes; bold lyric risk in photo-tree transfer heightens stakes organically to inevitable closure image.</comment>
