<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in chest tightening against forced stay and descent choices; final key-grab despite vision earns change with claustrophobia cost carried forward. No label-speak; micro-choices reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: organ ripples accumulate to warp rails into "jaws of a compass," pivoting to shaft reveal; CR closure via vision bargain reconfigures fear/options with tunnel-sealing cost on-page in missing pane image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Compass point and timber sleeper as micro-setting constrain circle-step choice and charge final void image; sensory hierarchy (echoes over sight) narrows under crisis, mirrors reflect ages to deepen internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake tightens via agency: anchoring compass forces spatial mutiny, narrowing retreat as organ chords circle; cost unmistakable in vision's "tunnels would close forever," charging poise before ascent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inner mutiny against fear emerges organically from warped geometry and mirrors; final "carried the mutiny inside her" reweights premise non-literally, with ambiguity in bargain lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with geometric perceptual signature ("angles went on strike"); rhythmic control modulates under stress, diction biased to cartographic idiom without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "notes sliding off curved iron ribs" does sensory/action/atmosphere; varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere in mutiny pattern without muddle at peak descent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phobia/exploration via "spatial mutiny" transforms tropes; risk in surreal warps (starlight keyhole) inevitable from compass/organ setup, heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
