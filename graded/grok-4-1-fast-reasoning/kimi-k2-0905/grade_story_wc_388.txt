<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation to excavate truth shines through contradictory impulses in the playback scene, where she tastes "copper and shame" yet endures to hang the diamond, earning a renunciation with personal cost. Interiority is embodied and particular, with observant flaws driving competent struggle. Final choice forecloses amnesia path, rooted in prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly: density builds from Geiger drop to letter reassembly to humming open, culminating in CR closure as diamond broadcast rots the orchard's preserved lies—cost legible in her shame and trees browning. Single scene causality chains tightly without gaps; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices vividly: hexagonal apple scars match letter tessellation, guiding reassembly; soil plunge signals stillpoint, root fiber wires diamond—micro-details charge final image where sap wets letters. Sensory hierarchy (Geiger ticks, dust hiss, apple glow) reflects POV urgency without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (excavate truth) tightens accumulatively via playback reversal, forcing endurance trade-off with visceral shame cost; agency in threading/hanging diamond forecloses personal possession. Pressure coheres to charged poise in orchard reaction, narrowing to conceptual rot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth rotting preserved lies emerges organically from particulars: diamond replays deceptions, final broadcast image reweights premise with orchard decay—no moralizing, resonant ambiguity in her "shovel cut her own hands."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (noting scars, temp drops) biases details character-specifically; voice modulates rhythmically under stress, compressing in playback beat. Lyrical diction purposeful and legible, prose as mind under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line multi-jobs (e.g., "Geiger’s pitch dropped... heartbeat refusing to die" advances plot/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative language patterned around lies/rot without muddle in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis: orchard as "slow-motion printing press" transforms post-apoc tropes via diamond's lie-archive curse, orchard reaction inevitable from seeded scars/letters. Risky lyric accumulation heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick.</comment>
