<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vendor's motivation to map negative space intensifies through sales and self-realization, earning her closure choice to subtract herself; contradictory impulses in recognizing her protagonism act in the final drink. Boy and librarian apply pressure via transactions revealing her impact. Interiority concrete via palm-poured moonlight showing unopened door.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of absences and sales builds to CR closure where vendor becomes door, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of self-erasure in "she uncorked a bottle, drank the moonlight, and became the outline." Orientation anchored early in glass orchard library opening. One tightening via tilting building suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Glass orchard's chiming fruit and obsidian cracks constrain setup and sales; clouds pressing walls and tilting floor alter tactics, charging final shattering bottle. Sensory selection (scent of rain, silver ribbon) reflects urgency, integrated via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of quantifying absence signaled early tightens accumulatively as orchard sags and building dips, forcing vendor's self-subtraction with legible conceptual cost. Agency in corking aroma, raising prices, drinking vial forecloses paths. Moral calculus in selling scissors for narratives.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of stories from absence emerges via sales of voids, resonant CR in customers stepping through vendor-door to white space without moral state. Final shattering letters reweight prior fragments non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with surreal perceptual signature (cracks "algorithm of absence") modulates rhythm under pressure; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("priced by the gram of what you leave behind"). Diction/rhythm purposeful in lyric compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with metaphors coherent/patterned (moonlight beams refracting prologues); no loops, propulsion via varied syntax in peak tilt ("felt the floorplate dip"). Minor figurative density in opening but taught early, no closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vendor selling absences in surreal library transforms clean-slate trope; risk in fragmented lyric structure heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight via shattering bottle into "first sentence."</comment>
