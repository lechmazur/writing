<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of quiet enthusiasm and stellar doubt act simultaneously through embodied sensations like doubt "gnawing her ribs" and heart fluttering; final sacrifice of identity earned by mounting pressure and prior micro-choices like casting stones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of static bursts and coin warmth builds to Conceptual Repricing closure when Lira swallows the spiral, with legible cost in identity surrender and tower folding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ambered panes brighten to molten gold and fold into chrysalis, constraining choices (coin grooves) and charging final image; sensory details like warm coins and cold brass rail filtered through Lira's perceptual urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of wavelength alignment escalates via accumulative density (reciting prophecy, surfing waves), driven by agency in arranging coins and supine surrender, culminating in unmistakable sacrificial cost at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of purpose-through-sacrifice emerges organically from reversing prophecies and waveform transformation; final chrysalis image offers resonant answer to doubt vs. enthusiasm without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in wavelength and static imagery; rhythmic lyric voice modulates from quiet study to transcendent collapse without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel forward, but figurative density (e.g., "static bursts drifted like dying breaths") borders overwriting in peak waves-pouring beat, slightly muddling propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cosmic contraction reframed through coin prophecies and self-swallowing transcendence feels inevitable and bold; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
