<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied contradictions like pulse recruited into slide's rhythm compelling the carving choice; final renunciation of GPS earned by prior learning motif, foreclosing tech-reliance path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from slide projection to thickened shadows to sculpture completion; closure as CR in slide dissolving and shadows scattering reconfigures journey with cost (drowned GPS, unmarked palms), anchored early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Archway as ledger and driftwood fissure constrain carving choices; sensory specifics like "salt-gray wood" and "pine pitch" filter through sculptor's bias, evolving with storm to charge final glowing curve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode slide as gift/geas escalates accumulatively via projections gaining weight and chisel braiding past/future; agency in wedging slide forces trade-off, with legible cost in storm-pause hush and GPS abandonment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of reimagining escape/arrival emerges organically from layered shadows and carving absolving wood; final gulls scattering offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting horizon without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "grammar of currents" and rhythmic modulation from turbine-hum to oarlock hush; single POV stable, compression purposeful and legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with metaphors cohering (spirals as stylus rewriting ledger) propels without loops; rhythm varies to peak in "final sliver fell," charging closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic slide in whale rib and archway ledger transforms driftwood tropes; carving as timewoven braiding risks bold lyricism, heightening stakes inevitably.</comment>
