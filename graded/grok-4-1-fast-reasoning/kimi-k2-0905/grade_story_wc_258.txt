<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority via embodied actions like barefoot ink footprints and thunder pauses; motivation rooted in inherited duty intensifies to earned endurance at closure; lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through density build to CR closure at infinite regression realization, with conceptual cost legible in "each door opening onto another rain-beaded loft"; orientation anchored early; one tightening at repeating sigil suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and oak floorboards constrain grid choices and mirror states via droplet "coin" sounds and fogged projections turning cards into "monitors displaying a dead token’s final trade," charging final drying image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of pattern-mapping escalates accumulatively via vector assignments and path multiplications to sigil break, narrowing knowledge with agency; cost unmistakable in infinite exits foreclosing escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fractal debt pattern emerges organically from grid intersections, with CR final image resonantly reweighting collapse premise via "footprints alone could serve as currency"; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature fusing mystical ink and Cartesian metrics; rhythmic modulation builds pressure, e.g., whisper to snap retraction; purposeful compression legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines, varied rhythm passes ear test; pervasive figuration (e.g., "circuit diagram drawn by mystics") risks slight overwriting but serves accumulative texture without obscuring sigil climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenious tarot-grid fusion reverse-engineers crypto collapse into fractal culture map; bold lyric risk heightens stakes, with infinite regression turn inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
