<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's embodied loss of smell roots motivation in tactile "mapping," with contradictory impulses (dismissed wonders vs. flickering drive) acting in the screw-reading scene; final pocketing earned by prior micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup to Conceptual Repricing closure ("maps of emotional terrain are drawn as much by loss"); orientation anchored in first paragraph, cost legible in pocketed screw and unregained smell.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Screw as micro-setting constrains choices (polishing, loupe exam, quarter-turn reassembly) and charges final image; fog and water clock sounds ("wet newborn gasp") mirror internal states tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unveil miracles via occluded reads) signaled early, tightens at screw realization narrowing options to acceptance; cost felt in "hollow nose might refill with meaning if not molecules."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of meaning-through-loss emerges from screw's story to final CR image (city "inhaling," screw pocketed); resonant non-literal answer reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with synesthetic perceptual signature (metal grooves as "panic in a delivery room"); Horace's sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden; rhythm modulates with intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor figurative density ("diaphragm contracting") in peak reflection risks coherence; no loops, propulsion clear to drip-time closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost aromatherapist reading metal emotions transforms trope; screw's birth-story turn inevitable from tactile premise, risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes.</comment>
