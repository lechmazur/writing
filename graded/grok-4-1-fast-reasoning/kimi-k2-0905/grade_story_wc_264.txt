<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Guard's dreamless training yields concrete micro-choices like not flinching at phantom hands and planting the clock, revealing values under pressure; embodied emotions via phantom weights and lighter coat earn the endurance. Minimal shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits to very strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density from clock-setting to box-resonance to pollen-children formation; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page when clock is planted face-down in sand—"gears kissing the sand"—unzipping time with cost in dimming poppies and transferred light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glowing dune and phosphorescent poppies constrain ascent and provide planting medium, evolving causally as pillars braid into silhouettes; recurring glassy sand and petals charge final image of dark dune.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to cultivate sparks tightens accumulatively via resonance splitting midnight and singing collapsing possibilities into glowing children; agency in planting forecloses with visible cost of light transfer and marching horizon.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of persistent lullabies emerges organically from ash-particles remembering leaves to sparks-in-lanterns; final image of glowing figures marching to unlit corners reweights loss with non-literal resonance of "what burns never truly sleeps."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward archives and wave functions; rhythmic compression taught early modulates beautifully to closure hush, with diction like "probability clouds condensing into small warm hands."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops or scaffolds; figurative consistency (wave functions, unzipping time) coherent in peaks, no muddle—"pages turning themselves, searching for singers" advances propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quantum-physics lullabies and divergent chess clock transform post-apoc guardian trope into inevitable synthesis; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes to charged pollen-children closure.</comment>
