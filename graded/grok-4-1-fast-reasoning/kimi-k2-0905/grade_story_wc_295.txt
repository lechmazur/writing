<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Chronicler's motivation to heal via witnessing intensifies credibly to her own burden revelation, with embodied grief (insomnia weight); minor epiphany slip at "I am the chronicler, but also the chronicled" borders unearned but ties to prior imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density builds to CR closure in inscription "Only when understanding dawns..." and temple crumble, with cost legible in carried pulse echo and shared name; orientation anchored early, single scene blurs purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Telescope and SS Lacertae constrain witnessing choice and charge final healing image; vivid synesthetic details (petals whisper, ink drinks light) filter through chronicler's priorities without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake to decode burdens deepens via her grief reveal, narrowing solo healing to shared light under Accumulative lens; agency in speaking syllables forces trade-off with visible cost in internalized stories settling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final star wink and whispered inscription offer non-literal resonant answer reweighting burdens as light, emerging organically from petal syllables and temple grief without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (starlight as doorway, pigments drinking light) distinct and biased; minor POV slip in "we stood inside both places" disrupts focalization briefly without full pattern teach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dense, varied rhythm propels with no loops or scaffolds; figurative layering coherent and pattern-taught via light-healing motif, though climax density borders overload without full restraint.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomy, floral ink, and grief-encoding transforms healing tropes; variable star Morse to temple doorway feels inevitable from early setup, risking bold poetic blur coherently.</comment>
