<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete micro-choices like tracing the rune and inserting the key; earned renunciation peaks when Lyra trades her shadow, revealing contradictory longing resolved with personal cost. Blind spots in shadows' departure drive competent struggle without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing closure at "the rune ᚦ flared, sealing the awakening... of her own forgotten silhouette"; cost legible in fused key and traded shadow. Orientation anchored early in observatory; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orrery rings and brass tracks constrain choices, charging final spiral; mirrors reflect nothing then her shadow, mirroring internal absence. Sensory hierarchy (moonlight angles, ticking gears) filters through rune scholar's priorities, evolving causally to descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find shadows' destination) signaled early, deepens via automaton's void revealing her shadow waving goodbye—forcing trade-off agency. Accumulative escalation reweights via loop-closing, with cost in personal silhouette loss unmistakable at key handoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of absence's geometry emerges organically via shifting spoon-stars and moonshadow sundial; final sigil "open eye balanced on a spoon" reconfigures premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity of sealed awakenings without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in geometric noticing (Möbius band, curvature of return); voice modulates rhythmically from deliberate to retrograde ticking. Minimal dialogue rasps authentically, advancing epoch check.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (e.g., "stars... smeared into silver spoons"); purposeful metaphors consistent without muddle or loops— "closing loops" pattern-taught early. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with pressure, no scaffolds dulling climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of spoon-bent reality, noon shadows fleeing, rune-sealed silhouettes transforms tropes into inevitable geometry of return; risk-taking in retrograde time heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
