<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via scent-tied memories and embodied tenderness; motivation intensifies through micro-choices like whispering into cork, earning final beckon with cost of lifelong transmission. Contradictory impulses (soft whisper vs. mechanical roar) act simultaneously in beacon adjustment and garden walk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent/vibration density builds from heat-break door to garden fountain, cadence shift in boat's course reconfigures mother's loss as ongoing vibration with emotional cost. Orientation anchored in opening line; single-scene coherence with CR closure legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy (scent-dominant) reflects POV urgency, garden/night flowers constrain choices by releasing perfume waves that match pulse and purify intent. Final boat image charged by cobalt tower's pulse mirroring hand beckon.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers > shouts) signaled early, deepens via rhythm-matching actions narrowing to single note; under Textural lens, density reweights with cost of "unbearable love" in boat's subtle turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (softest voice farthest via tenderness) emerges organically from cork whisper to beam acknowledgment; final image reweights premise without moral, resonating mother's sea-travel on vibrations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in vibration/scent noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate climb to charged poise in garden, elisions (mother's fate) taught early and paid in CR.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (vibrate/pulse/rhythm) taught as pattern, but minor paraphrase loops in scent motifs and figurative density in peak garden beat dull propulsion slightly; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh magic-realist synthesis of lighthouse duty with vibration/scent as intent-travel; risk-taking in lyric tone heightens stakes, culminating in boat's "imperceptibly" guided return as inevitable payoff.</comment>
