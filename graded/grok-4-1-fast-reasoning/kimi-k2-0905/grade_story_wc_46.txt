<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied ("weight settle inside her chest, the exact mass of every night"), motivation intensifies via memories tilting present choices toward sharing; final dissolution earns renunciation of isolation with felt cost in "pearl’s absence as fullness." Contradictory impulses subtle in ache vs. resolve, but hierarchy of values clear in rooftop endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: polishing density builds to drop-flare-balance, yielding RR closure as pearl scatters memories into Charged Poise; cost legible in "sea glass, now matte and ordinary" and heartbeat synchronization. Orientation anchored early (grotto, pouch); no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Serpentine wall and mist constrain pivotal tilt/weigh (wall hums, fissure drops), charging final mirror image; sensory selective via star-watcher bias (pulses, glimmers). Micro-setting (driftwood tongs) enables safe handling, mirroring internal priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (share light sans fire) signaled early, textural escalation via ritual intensification (polish→mist→drop→balance) narrows to sharing trade-off; agency in micro-choices forecloses isolation with cost in pearl dissolution and glass dulling. Climax drop tests commitment visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (quiet light/sharing without burning) emerges organically from mother's echo, villagers' fear, and memory-fragments scattering; final rooftop image reconfigures fear-to-calm without moralizing, reweighting memories as "constellations she could now share."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual signature (light as fireflies, zephyr bloom); single POV stable, rhythmic modulation heightens ritual pressure without slippage. Compression purposeful, taught early in polish method.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied rhythms, no loops); figuratives coherent ("petals of luminance unfurling") without muddle, payoff in closure flare; zero scaffolds, read-aloud flows seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of star-gazing ritual into grotto alchemy transforms isolation tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in pearl's hush-vortex scattering memories without fire.</comment>
