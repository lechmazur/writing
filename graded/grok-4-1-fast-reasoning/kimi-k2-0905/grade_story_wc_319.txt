<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied library metaphors (paw prints as pages) reveals contradictory homesickness and patient ritual; final renunciation of crossing earns companionship with visible cost in pendant's abandonment. Minor abstraction in "she thought" epiphany slightly dilutes immediacy but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual density builds to Charged Poise closure: refusal to cross reconfigures homesickness into companionship, with legible cost in pendant placement and erased paw prints. Orientation anchors early (guardian in frozen garden at night); pattern taught without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen garden's frost, mist, and rosemary constrain ritual (ice halts cultist's fire) and charge final image (pendant on ice under moon). Sensory selectivity (scent of unread stories, crystallizing breath) reflects POV urgency; micro-setting of boundary door pulses with tidal light, mirroring internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (befriend uncertainty) signaled early via nightly ritual; textural escalation accumulates through pendant's Morse and boundary softening, narrowing to renunciation with felt cost in non-crossing and return. Single tightening suffices under lens; no agency slips at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of befriending uncertainty emerges organically from ritual images (frost as marginalia, waiting vs. forcing); final image of uncertainty as companion offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting prior homesickness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (everything library-filtered: tail as bookmark); rhythmic prose modulates from prowling density to poised stasis, teaching foggy pattern early for legible closure. No head-hopping or distance leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (photons refusing to decide) propels via varied rhythm; minor repetition of "waiting" and "frost" patterns texturally without loops. Closure image (expanded boundary as second fur) clear and charged, no artifacts dulling it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of feral guardian, photon uncertainty, and ritual waiting transforms library trope into dimensional homesickness; risk of lyric accumulation pays off in pendant's Morse and non-crossing poise, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
