<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between numbness and seeking vibration act in carving/playing beats; final welcoming of grief earned by embodied progression through bone-felt melody. Temen applies gentle pressure via drum-making duet. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like post-loss muting drive struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vibrations/textures build density from needle repair to drum merger, yielding RR closure in "grief arrived fully... welcomed... like a drumroll" with emotional cost legible. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cavern's tools (lathe, hides) constrain repair/drum choices; cedar dust, frost, earth floor charge tactile immersion. Final cavern-mouth snowflake hush mirrors internal resonance, recharging opening seasons.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeat numbness) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening—backward melody peels layers, drum merges memory—narrowing to raw grief with agency in choices. Cost unmistakable in "raw, livable pain" and foreclosed numbness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of hush spun to resonance emerges from particulars like reversed lullaby and needle-as-necklace; final image non-literally answers numbness via forward-beating drum without moralizing. Subtext in signed silence enriches ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with deaf-biased perceptual signature (vibrations via bones/floor); lyrical rhythm modulates from hush to drumroll under pressure. Signing natural/subtextual; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in vibration beats); purposeful metaphors like "filament of hush" cohere without muddle. No loops, scaffolds, or overwriting in closure; propulsion peaks in merger beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deafness, backward playback, drum-craft transforms grief trope into tactile ingenuity; risk in lyric hush-pattern heightens stakes, inevitable in needle-necklace reprise.</comment>
