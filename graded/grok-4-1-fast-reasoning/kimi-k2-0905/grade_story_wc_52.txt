<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied interiority peaks in thumb tracing grain like mane, revealing contradictory impulses to contain yet release memory; final endurance of carving as sentinel earned via prior micro-choices under loss pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through density build to CR closure in "memory can be both cage and key"; cost legible in whispered commands "death had better hearing."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rain-light pooling on blank and workbench grain constrain carving choices; skylight evolves to reflect "her face and the empty ring," charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to harvest lessons tightens accumulatively via carving curls carrying "rust-hued peace" of blood-soaked sawdust; felt cost in foreclosed forgetting reconfigures stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Here-and-gone motif reweights via carving's "sleeping lion" shifting to "eyes open" potential; final image answers containment as dual cage/key without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with circus-biased perception ("sawdust and thunder") stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from kettle hush to loft expansion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dense propulsion in "each curl that fell carried rust-hued peace"; varied rhythm, coherent metaphors avoid muddle, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grief-as-taming via carving synthesizes circus loss into inevitable "cage and key" CR; transforms widow trope through tactile, voice-specific particulars.</comment>
