<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kit's desperately jocular armor embodies contradictory impulses—joking against catalyzing memories of drowned loneliness—earning his departure choice with visible cost in leaving the transformed station.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from Lila's arrival to sapling chimes and pilgrims, landing CR closure in the waving ivy with emotional cost of Kit's departure legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ivy, clock, and rails constrain choices (planting between rails, queues on platform) and charge final image (ivy gateway waving), evolving causally from polite refusal to reciprocal farewell.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Loneliness stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via rumor chains and story-feeding saplings to clock spin, forcing Kit's agency in boarding the train with felt cost of abandoning the cure he catalyzed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Reciprocity theme emerges organically from rock doubling and story-fed mirrors reflecting others, resonant final image reweights premise without moralizing: loneliness stored in lost-property forever.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (jokes framing solitude) and rhythmic prose modulate pressure; Lila's anarchic dialogue distinct, subtextual in "moon tax" exchange.</comment>
