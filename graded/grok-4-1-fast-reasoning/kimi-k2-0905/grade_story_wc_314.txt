<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between logic ("dew freezes at zero Celsius") and intuition ("hummed in her pulse") act simultaneously throughout, culminating in an earned fusion choice with visible sentimental cost via the ribbon from her mother's dress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from entry to crystal touch, delivering Charged Poise closure ("mind and wonder spinning around a common center") with legible conceptual cost in the protagonist's rearranged axis; orientation anchored early via waterfall and orchard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mica chunks, quince scent, and starling patterns constrain choices (coordinates "three spirals north") and charge the final image of orchard inverted in the drop, with sensory hierarchy filtered through alchemist's pattern-noticing bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to harmonize logic/intuition tightens accumulatively via bird-revealed crystal and looming transformation ("horizon already bled indigo"), driven by agency in ritual; cost unmistakable in "trembling on the cusp" and axis shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of logic-intuition harmony emerges organically from particulars like prime-number bird healing and starling manuscript, reweighted non-literally in the fusion image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (noticing "aerial manuscript," metallic scents) modulates rhythmically under pressure, stable single-POV distance with purposeful compression teaching its mythic pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via integrated images ("flame leapt, obedient yet wild"), though figurative layering borders density overload in ritual beat; no loops, clean syntax, closure image sharpened.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical quest with starling murmuration as oracle transforms tropes, risking bold lyric compression that heightens mythic stakes inevitably toward "sing it rightly" reconfiguration.</comment>
