<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under inversion pressure, like clutching the arrow tip amid lifting trees; motivation intensifies credibly from childhood question to contributing memories at climax. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses caps below 9; competence dominates without deeper flaw-driven struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to inversion climax; on-page CR closure via sapling graft and arrow mend reconfigures resilience premise with felt cost of Aera's memories drawn out. Orientation anchored early via skiff drift under arches; no lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arches and water streams constrain choices (navigation, landing shelf, apex slot) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy sharpens under inversion urgency, like "rivers loosened into spirals." Recurrent motifs like mossy bark and irrigation notation filter through pilot's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resilience source) signaled early tightens via arrow-activated echoes and inversion escalation under Accumulative lens, narrowing to prism sapling with agency in pressing shard; cost legible in reciprocal memory graft. Protagonist endurance forecloses doubt path with orchard's recognition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of resilience as shared process emerges organically from echoes converging on sapling, reweighting premise in final image without moralizing; her statement to pickers ("resilience is the echo we decide to keep speaking") borders thematic echo, deducting slightly for directness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (streams as "music scores," echoes as "pressure") with rhythmic control modulating inversion intensity; single POV stable, no head-hopping, purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged poise at graft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion syncing scene rhythm (short sentences in leaps, breathing hush); no loops or artifacts, metaphors coherent (roots to soil, tuning fork arrow). Minor figurative density in acceleration beat contained without muddling climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inverted gravity orchards, echo archive, and arrow catalyst feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric worldbuilding heightens stakes via inversion "rehearsal," transforming tropes without gimmickry.</comment>
