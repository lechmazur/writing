<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak at lake bargain ("wade in and absorb every pain... or retreat"), compelling earned immersion with embodied nausea and guilt as visible cost; interiority particular via trembling hand signing lives away.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density tightens from ward hum to lake circuit; CR/RR closure in "pain circulating, diluting" reconfigures void to mural with undeniable conceptual cost of responsibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lake's glow constrains wade-or-retreat choice and charges final skin-lit bones; sensory hierarchy (wet silence, cold fire) filters through post-procedure haze, mirroring internal fracture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kindle empathy) deepens via lake reversal narrowing to fracture consent; agency in stepping forward forecloses hollow path with on-page skipped heartbeat and borrowed rhythms.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Resonant non-literal answer in time loop ("seed" to tightening stitch) reweights redemption as turnstile without moralizing; emerges organically from baseball's evolution and circuit image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward glowing scars and wet silence; rhythmic control heightens immersion pressure, modulating from hum to warped voice without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in peak ("bioluminescence crawled under his skin, illuminating bones like paper lanterns"); minor figurative density in metaphors coherent and pattern-taught, no loops dulling lake closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of memory wipe, orbiting baseball, pain-circuit redemption loop feels inevitable; bold lyric shards transform tropes, risking poetic compression that heightens closure without obscurity.</comment>
