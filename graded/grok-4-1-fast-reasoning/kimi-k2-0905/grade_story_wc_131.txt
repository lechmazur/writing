<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in sense memory and methodical caching compels the final reveal with embodied emotion peaking at "his own voice, recorded years ago." Internal conflict subtle in hidden life vs. visibility, shown through micro-choices like pausing to watch the girl. Girl's minimal presence applies pressure without dilution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as voices accumulate density to Charged Poise closure at "I see you," reconfiguring Elias's isolation with legible emotional cost in the hand-palm press. Single scene anchored early; no orientation debt. Pattern of fragments tightens to resonant payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Library crawl space, pipe chases, and floorboard gaps constrain uncovering choices and charge final image where girl's palm rests "directly above Elias’s heart." Sensory details like "sapphire hush" and flickering lights evolve with action. Micro-setting of conduits and joists lived-in and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of visibility via cached voices signaled early, escalates accumulatively as girl follows sounds to Lorca fragment, narrowing isolation. Agency in methodical uncovering forces trade-off of hidden life; cost felt in becoming "visible—not in flesh, but in presence."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of stories as "lanterns" cached in darkness emerges organically from fragments culminating in shared chorus, reweighting premise without statement. Final image of voices humming and girl reading offers non-literal resonance to visibility question. Particulars like Lorca's "duende" deepen complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person close to Elias with perceptual signature in tactile mapping ("every joist and conduit") and voice-driven rhythm modulating to hushed intensity. Prose texture distinct, lyric compression taught early via fragments. No head-hopping; girl's minimal view clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like fragment evoking "mother’s lavender water"; rhythm varies for propulsion, peaking in short sentences at "She needed the voices." Purposeful "sapphire hush" repetition pattern-taught without loops. No artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-outage library dweller caching ghost voices transforms isolation trope via tape fragments' sense memory. Risky crawl-space POV heightens stakes organically; closure's "I see you" inevitable from methodical buildup. Non-obvious emotional truth in analog remnants.</comment>
