<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and embodied emotion, with rhythms in chest demanding translation rooting her drive; micro-choices like striking forks reveal values under pressure. Final shift from fear/grief to wonder earned via thermal mapping, foreclosing prior career with cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fork strikes layer density, culminating in CR where dome weeps and frost burns image—cost legible in "capsizing...now began her masterpiece." Orientation anchored early (Mara, conservatory, post-Hush). Lens taught by midpoint, closure reconfigures silence with undeniable conceptual cost, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Conservatory constrains via chill, frosted panes mirroring silence; diamond dust crunches under boots, frost weeps as liquid notes in climax. Recurring scanner/thermals charge final image. POV bias filters acoustic world to heat, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence) signaled early, tightens via accumulative deepening as forks bloom aurora to audience harmonizing—agency in sequences forecloses auditory path. Cost unmistakable in battery death and thawed frost. Escalation driven by her choices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of translated silence emerges organically from thermal instruments/audience; final child's treble clef cloud and thawing fifths offer resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise without moral. Particulars like gold ember anchor complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature shifting acoustic to thermal (e.g., "breath...unplayed chords"); rhythmic control modulates from methodic to crescendo. Distinct diction/texture under pressure, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., forks vibrate silently yet flare crimson); varied rhythm accelerates in "played harder, faster." Zero loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle, passing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalypse trope via thermal synesthesia, with forks-as-painter's-box synthesis inevitable from particulars. Bold lyric risk (silent aurora) heightens closure without gimmickry, fully committing to premise.</comment>
