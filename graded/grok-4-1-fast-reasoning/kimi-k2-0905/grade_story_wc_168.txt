<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses in the ash-tasting beat compel the speaking choice; hoarse voice reveals scarred firefighter under pressure; final commission earned via prior guilt-ember motif without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup through ritual beats to RR closure (Charged Poise in spiral drawing and descent); cost legible in "not forgiven—but commissioned"; orientation anchored early via ridge path and granite dish.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Granite dish as altar and scarred cheek constrain ritual choices, charging final moon-polished image; sensory details (pines' burn smell, moonlight fracture) filtered through fire-trauma POV; micro-setting (porcelain box, wrist) recharges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate guilt-pain) deepens via ash-to-ink transformation under Accumulative lens, narrowing to verbal/spiral output with embodied cost (tears salt-washing burns); one tightening sufficient, agency in endurance forecloses silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of pain-as-language emerges organically from ash-spiral image, reweighting bargain premise without statement; girl's "hard softness" invites reflection, resonant CR in sprout's "first word"; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with fire-inflected perceptual signature (embers speak, skin heals tighter); rhythmic modulation in ritual (short sentences at tasting, longer at speaking); purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "tasting charcoal, tasting childhood campfires"); varied rhythm, coherent fire/light metaphors without muddle or loops; figurative pattern taught via opening burn imagery pays off in spiral glint.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh ritual synthesis of ash-box alchemy under celestial gaze transforms firefighter guilt trope; bold lyric risk in pain-language frame heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via ember-speaking turn.</comment>
