<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Priest's illumination drive compels micro-choices like pedal press and indigo immersion, earning unraveling with felt risk; embodied smile and laugh ground otherwise abstract interiority. Novice echoes traits coherently. Minor abstraction in emotion slightly distances peak contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as indigo density and looped silence tighten to CR closure: anchor reconfigures as question with priest's dissolution cost legible ("become one of them"). Two-shard structure (priest scene to novice threshold) transitions legibly; orientation anchors instantly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Indigo trail and loop pedal as micro-settings constrain choices (reveals assumptions, coils silence) and charge final image (empty palette, dried indigo). Sensory hush pulses purposefully; spatial coherence tracks rising paint cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminate anchor's lie before possession) signaled early, deepens texturally via looped question and rising symbols narrowing to self-immersion trade-off. Agency in rhetorical cast and step-in forces possession hesitation; cost unmistakable in unraveling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of knowing over banishing emerges organically from indigo symbols and looped silence, reweighting silence as "alive" in CR without moralizing. Final novice smile resonates prior "decoration" tension non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poetic perceptual signature ("silence decorated... like frost") biases toward indigo/thought textures, stable third-limited shards with clean novice break. Sparse dialogue subtextual, goal-driven; rhythm modulates pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical density propels with varied syntax and image economy; purposeful "this time" reprise builds cycle without loop penalty. Minor figurative stack ("noose of understanding") risks muddle but pattern-taught pays in closure hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ingenious loop pedal/priest/indigo synthesis transforms exorcism into textural illumination, risking surreal cycle payoff that hindsight-makes inevitable; bold voice commits fully without retreat.</comment>
