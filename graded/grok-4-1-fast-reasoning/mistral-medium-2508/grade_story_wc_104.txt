<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in past chains and "patiently strategic" trait compels micro-choices like the piano trap; embodied patience shines in deliberate key-slotted sequence and poppy roll. Minor slip in occasional label-like interiority ("chained liberator") but actions earn final planting with cost of guard risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: wall fall → vault open → guard interrupt → trap → plant/escape as Decisive Change with Charged Poise in horizon walk and fading shouts as felt cost. Orientation anchors instantly in carnival; single scene tightens cleanly without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Carnival micro-setting (piano keys, duck-pond pit, prize tickets) constrains choices and charges climax trap; recurring piano/pit evolves causally, mirroring resilience in final creaking sign image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secure seeds amid collapse/guard) tightens causally at guard shadow → piano strike reversal, narrowing escape with on-page cost of potential capture foreclosed by agency. Escalation coherent under causal lens, agency in every turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of twisted resilience emerges via scattered seeds/scattered planting vs. straight rows, resonant in final "not with a roar, but with a seed" image reweighting force vs. grace without statement. No moralizing; complexity in recklessness arrow callback.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward symbols/seeds; lyrical rhythm modulates tension (short sentences at guard crunch), diction purposeful like "hissed open." No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "plucked a vial of poppy seeds, rolled it... struck middle C"); varied rhythm propels, zero loops or scaffolds, metaphors coherent like "roots through stone."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival vault/keys as resistance arsenal transforms dystopian tropes; carnival sign reprise and poppy trap feel inevitable, risk in poetic compression heightens stakes organically.</comment>
