<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in Elias's trembling hands lifting the stone despite knowing its curse, earning the final sacrificial choice with embodied cost in his unraveling laugh and lost honesty. Interiority particular through repairman's lens of "stitching fractures with solder and patience." Flaw of mending lies drives inevitable folly without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of rust, hunger, and resonance builds to chamber's tipping and unspooling, delivering on-page Conceptual Repricing in the empty chamber's warm gear with conceptual cost of unchecked light as fire. Orientation anchored early in chamber and Elias's kneeling. No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint of stone's pull shapes every tactic to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Resonance chamber constrains choices via leaning walls and singing brass that unspool in climax, charging final empty image. Sensory hierarchy (ozone/copper over visuals) reflects repairman's tactile priorities. Details evolve causally from hum to scream, mirroring internal decay without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of reclamation tightens via crank's resistance yielding to stone's burn, forcing Elias's agency in pressing it to chest and unwinding the lie with escalating density under Accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable in consumed self and city's backward clocks. Moral calculus between mend and end forecloses safe repair path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mending as theft emerges organically from particulars, answered non-literally in final gear's unrecognized tune reweighting "some ends sing" without moralizing. Resonance from rust creeping tools to dawn's bleed avoids platitudes. Protagonist arc inextricable from covenant's choice-complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in "coaxing silence back into sound," modulating rhythm to match intensity from held breath to screamed walls. Diction/rhythm purposeful and biased, no leakage. Voice distinct as tinker's poetic weave without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line layers image/action (e.g., "brass peeling back to reveal...dawn") without loops or scaffolds. Rhythms vary naturally, metaphors coherent in rust/light pattern without muddle in peak unspooling. Zero artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh alchemy synthesis transforms tropes via rust-as-choice covenant, with stone-as-key turning mending into reclamation risk. Bold poetic structure heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight in gear's hum as mend/end without hedging.</comment>
