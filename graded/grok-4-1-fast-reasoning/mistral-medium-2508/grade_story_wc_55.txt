<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear of heresy vs. petrichor-driven nostalgia) act in the kneeling beat, earning the final assembly choice with embodied cost in joint protest and fracture mirroring his face.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from hunch to crack ("A crack split the crystal") to chimes, delivering CR closure where the sanctuary exhales, reweighting silence with undeniable cost in forecourt ruin.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains the pivotal palm choice and charges the final image as fracture site for orrery pieces, with petrichor and stained-glass light filtering through scribe's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (peace with dream) deepens via petrichor realization and palm-bearing, narrowing to assembly under Accum lens; agency in fracture tolerance forecloses obedience path with legible cost in elders' future judgment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final chime image ("the world answered") non-literally reweights hush-as-preservation premise through imperfect orrery release, emerging organically from whispers-as-echoes motif without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in time-bound noticing ("tick of the tower’s heart") sustains close third-limited POV, with rhythmic modulation heightening release in chime progression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in lines like "whispers coil around his wrists like vines" propels without loops; figurative coherence (crystal voices, gears alive) taught early pays off in thawing hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwork heresy and crystal-echo release transforms silence tropes; bold lyric risk in asymmetrical orrery heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from forecourt whispers.</comment>
