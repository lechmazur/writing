<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization excels in embodied curse of knowing, with contradictory impulses in weaving dust despite unraveling vision; final endurance earned by bleeding hands and dust assimilation, foreclosing frictionless escape.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density builds to Conceptual Repricing closure—"dust settled into her bones"—with legible cost in burning skin and ongoing duty; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bluff's slick crevices and dust constrain rock placement and dust-weaving choice; aurora fractures charge final image, sensory details (warm grains, fogging breath) filter through Liora's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rewriting patterns escalates via mirror-unraveling and voice-warning, forcing agency in push with bleeding cost; tightening reweights to eternal herding under Accumulative lens, though abstract "something waiting" slightly mutes peak visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of promises as anchors emerges organically from dust-etched eels and fraying edges; final "footsteps the only friction" reconfigures premise without moralizing, resonant with conceptual cost of cursed vigilance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pattern-obsessed noticing (spirals, fractals); rhythmic modulation peaks in terse "She pushed," stable close-third POV with no leakage, lyric compression taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines, but minor figurative density in opening ("slick as a breath held too long") risks overwrite without pattern payoff; no loops, rhythm varies, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frictionless physics, star-dust anchors, and cursed herding transforms tropes; risk in elliptical buildup inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via irreplaceable dust-reprise.</comment>
