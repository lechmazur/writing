<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation from ledgers roots steady defiance, embodied in "lips twitched" and micro-choices like precise picks under alarm risk; competence balanced by genuine struggle in "one wrong twist." Final whistle reveals earned change with child’s laughter cost. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout therefore dial aligns, picks coax hatch, armory yields (DC closure) with exposure cost in "tools flashed... alarms would scream." Orientation anchors early (Kael at gate, blackout, sundial by ~100 words). Persistent time constraint shapes tactics to signal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sundial base and gearwork nest constrain access, charging final "twilight’s return bled across the horizon"; sensory hierarchy (humming walls to tumblers singing) filters via lockpoet's bias. Evolving details (pried base, groaning hatch) mirror internal hardening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (armory breach) tightens via causal agency: quill tools to hatch to master bolt, foreclosing alarm/exposure options with "one slip... orbs flare." Cost unmistakable in steady hands amid "vulnerable... bowstring."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Light stolen/returned motif emerges organically, reweighted in final gold-painted fort where "world had changed"; sparks-from-ledgers ties character to theme without statement. Resonant hush avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature ("fingers tracing... like a poet"); rhythmic modulation peaks in terse "The lock surrendered. A breath." No head-hopping, diction fits inventive sentinel.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels ("bronze quill holder... worn smooth" multi-jobs); rhythm varies, no loops, but figurative density ("lantern... bowstring, forge") borders overwrite in setup without peak harm. Clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: clerk-tools spark revolution via cipher sundial, transforming lockpicking heist with poetic hush; quill holder reprise risks lyrical boldness, heightening stakes organically. No close template echoes.</comment>
