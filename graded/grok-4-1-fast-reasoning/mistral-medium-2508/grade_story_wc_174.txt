<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses (expose epiphanies vs. deepen dark) embodied in hands' serenity amid doubt; final renunciation of tight control earned via miner's rage recalled in "You think this is a game?"; flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflections tightens to Charged Poise closure in "the question had finally grown interesting," reconfiguring ethical stance with felt cost of "the shape of the dark"; orientation anchored early in dome/salt flats; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dome's acoustics/history and stick constrain choices (chosen site, pressed into embers) and charge final image (pocketed glowing tip); sensory hierarchy POV-biased (smell of damp wool, firelight warping shadow); micro-setting integrates via tactile handling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical puppetry) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via miner's lunge tightening doubt into reversal choice; agency in "let the puppets stumble" forecloses precision path with cost of visible seams; minor abstractness in stakes visibility prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-strings emerges organically from particulars (puppets, stick scars), reweighted non-literally in final step into dark offering resonant answer to ethical question; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in "half-lit... bright enough to see by."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (letters breathe, sound curls inward); rhythmic control modulates reflective hush to charged poise without opacity; stable single-POV, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture/stakes (e.g., "ribs rusted into a permanent sigh"); zero loops/artifacts, varied rhythm passes read-aloud; figurative language purposeful, no muddle in peak reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligrapher-puppeteer in dome/bar transforms storytelling tropes via shadow ethics; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes coherently; inevitable hindsight from stick/puppets motif without derivative echoes.</comment>
