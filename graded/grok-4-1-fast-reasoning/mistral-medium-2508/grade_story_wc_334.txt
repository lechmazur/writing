<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in "what if the gaps in his mind weren’t losses, but spaces held open?" driving earned confrontation; interiority embodied in memory fragments slipping fingers and spine vibration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density surges to CR closure in sky knitting and "weight of his own life press down... heavy and bright as a starfall," with legible conceptual cost; orientation anchored early in orchard water.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse water constrains wading to pedestal; shipwrecks and shattered dome charge final sky groan, mirroring internal fracture through tactile silt and hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory recovery tightens via mushroom-to-stone surge narrowing to trade-off realization, forcing whisper agency; cost felt in slipping fragments and life-weight press under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of stars knitting reweights past-chasing premise non-literally, emerging from particulars like residue and sailor’s hollowed gourd without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with folklorist perceptual bias (gills on mushroom, iridescent residue); rhythmic texture modulates from still-water prickle to held-note hum, dialogue subtextual in confrontation exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels to peak; minor figurative density in opening leviathan/ribs consistent and pattern-taught, no loops dulling "fairy ring crumbling to dust" closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore/memory-trading via broken constellations and pedestal map transforms tropes organically, with bold mythic risk heightening stakes to friend-faced eater reveal.</comment>
