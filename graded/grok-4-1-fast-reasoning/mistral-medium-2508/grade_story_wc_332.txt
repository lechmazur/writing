<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Librarian's hesitation—"the library was a place of order"—reveals contradictory impulses between duty and beauty, earning the pivotal "Stay" choice with embodied cost in the dream's fraying and her damp pillow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of light-imagery builds from failed film to pulsing photo to palette flare, landing Charged Poise closure in "Stay" with legible cost of dream's erasure in the tide-smeared footstep.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Black sand, prism shards, and saltwind constrain setup and timing, charging final dew-filled palette image; sensory selection (ozone, warm pulse) mirrors urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of recapturing the dream tightens via failed attempt to fraying edges under sunrise pressure, forcing agency in "Stay" with felt cost of ephemerality reconfiguring her world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of living vs. shelving stories emerges implicitly through particulars like the woman's plea and librarian's choice, resonating in final dream without moralizing, reweighting "improbable beginnings."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("painting with light," "ink ghosts") sustains lyrical third-limited POV; rhythmic modulation peaks in "palette flared—once, twice—like a match in a hurricane."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image-packed lines, though minor figurative density in climax ("schools of fish beneath the surface") risks slight overload without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-photography and light-palette transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens closure's inevitability in damp pillow/dew reprise.</comment>
