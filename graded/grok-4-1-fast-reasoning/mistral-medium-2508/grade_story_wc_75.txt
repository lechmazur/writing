<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation rooted in grandmother's inheritance compels micro-choices like lifting the shaking lens and shattering it, with embodied conflict in hands remembering before mind; shattering feels earned, foreclosing lens as tool with personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as lens reveals build density to shattering's RR (Charged Poise in scattered shards pulsing like heartbeat), with cost legible in lens destruction; mosaic shards transition legibly without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto's waterfall spray and skylight constrain lens use across beats, charging closure in hives on cliffs and roaring approval; lichen "like old regret" mirrors stakes tactilely through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rescuing arts signaled early tightens via lens deepening (hands slipping to voices humming), driven by Liora's agency to shatter, with irreplaceable cost charging final baking image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of release over possession emerges organically from lens thaw to shattering, with final "letting the old ways thaw into new hands" reweighting prior absorptions non-literally; falls' roar-warning adds complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in tactile-historical noticing ("dough twisting itself tighter"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, rhythm modulates from dread to charged poise without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels (e.g., "emerald shards embedded in the wood, pulsing like a second heartbeat"); coherent metaphors like "letters like tombstones" avoid muddle, no loops or scaffolds in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Absorbed arts and initial-baking synthesize fresh magical realism, with lens-shatter risking bold reconfiguration that heightens communal stakes inevitably from world logic.</comment>
