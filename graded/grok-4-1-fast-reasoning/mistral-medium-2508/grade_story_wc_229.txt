<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation roots in mother's cork and intensifies through embodied effort (throat aches while exhaling scent), earning Harkin's recognition; contradictory impulses (superstition vs proof) act in the confrontation beat, with final endurance (no longer needs cork) showing visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of vibrations/scents builds to boats turning one by one and Harkin's softening; closure as Charged Poise in "He knew" reconfigures lighthouse from warning to invitation, with felt cost in "clean, bright ache of dawn."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lighthouse bones/vibrations constrain beckoning tactic; recurring dead garden scents (lavender, jasmine) evolve causally to charge final image of "gardens...yet to be planted," mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers) signaled early, escalates via textural density (boats prick ears, dreams pull them); agency in sustained exhalation forecloses brute horn option, with unmistakable cost in throat ache and slow hands tying boats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (whispers > shouts) emerges organically from scent-pull vs foghorn, reweighted in final image of resonant humming lighthouse as invitation; non-literal answer in "world...leaned in to listen" carries conceptual cost of prior shouting futility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in sensory bias (scents curling doubt, vibrations as held breath); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Harkin's trailing "That’s not…"), distinguishing voices; rhythmic compression under stress in beckoning beat serves pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "lips parted, exhaling...garden’s memory"); figurative pattern taught early pays off without muddle in closure; minor density drag from metaphors in every peak sentence caps at strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism (intent as scent/vibration in lived lighthouse routine) transforms trope; risk in lyric texture heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via cork's pulse enabling whisper-proof.</comment>
