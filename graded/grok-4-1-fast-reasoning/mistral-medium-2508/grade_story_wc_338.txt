<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority in tracing the map tear and overlaying films, revealing methodical curiosity under subtle internal pressure from Guild assumptions; earned change in perceiving map as key, but lacks sharper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously to fully compel 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from film discrepancies to CR closure ("map...felt like a key") reweighting premise; cost legible in no-proof certainty and foreclosed measurable worldview, on-page in mind's-eye stitching.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vault, henge, and body (palm to pillar) constrain listening choice and charge final hum-in-ribs image; sensory details (drips, fogged glass) selectively urgent and POV-biased to map framer's precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher silence/map tear) signaled early, deepens via film overlay narrowing to time-threshold realization under Accum lens; agency in threading her reel, but pressure remains meditative with felt-but-subtle cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as language emerges organically from particulars like film flicker and henge hum; resonant CR ending reweights "uncharted" without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on proof vs. certainty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of precise measurements ("quiet spaces between"); rhythmic prose modulates from analytical to lyrical at peak realization, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image-charged sentences, but minor paraphrase loops on "silence" (e.g., "silence wasn’t empty...waiting") slightly dull peak without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of map tear as time-threshold and henge as temporal marker feels inevitable from film method; transforms cartography tropes through textural discovery without late rules.</comment>
