<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to find beauty in imperfection drives concrete micro-choices like signing "Awaken" at the cracked vase and arranging plants, with embodied emotion in fearing silence after the phoenix; relationships crucible via Liora's understanding and old woman's pressure force relational shift. Minor flaw: old woman's cunning feels sketched without full contradictory impulses shown on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density tightening from solo plant-arranging to shared music and hand-squeeze, landing Charged Poise closure in courtyard blooming around "Stay" sign with felt bargain cost; orientation anchored early in glassblower’s courtyard post-phoenix. Single continuous scene with legible relational deepening suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Courtyard micro-setting constrains communication via potted fern, kiln vase, and petal bed, charging final blooming image; sensory selection (embers as fireflies, smoke-rough voice, concertina wheeze) filters through Elias's shape-focused, colorblind POV, mirroring internal awakening without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcoming post-phoenix silence via imperfect communication) signaled early and deepens accumulatively through Liora's basil pot and vase understanding, narrowing to shared music with thorn-patience cost; agency in signing and playing forecloses isolation. Minor abstractness in fear of silence lacks one visceral tactical alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in cracks emerges organically from vase, reed, phoenix ashes reweighted in final "beauty wasn’t in the colors" realization tying prior plant language; resonant non-literal closure in dandelion and blooming ivy answers imperfection question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with perceptual signature in shape-tracing (fronds trembling when hummed) and rhythmic prose modulating from solitary hum to shared wheeze; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You’re asking me something," "Teach me the language") advances relational pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "plucked a dandelion...tucked it behind her ear—'Awaken'") propels via varied rhythm; purposeful lyric repetition of courtyard motifs avoids loops, metaphors coherent (embers as fireflies). Minor paraphrase in repeated "courtyard" aliveness slightly dulls late propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of colorblind plant-language barters and phoenix-frame imperfections transforms tropes into organic awakening arc; risk in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes via reed's evolution from broken sigh to promise.</comment>
