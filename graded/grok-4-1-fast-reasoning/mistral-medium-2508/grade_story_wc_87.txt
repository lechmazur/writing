<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in the "merrily melancholic" laugh amid hesitation, with embodied compass warmth anchoring regret; final renunciation to stay earned by letter's embodied read on post office steps, showing hierarchy of values without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via tightening density of pole-counting and navigation motifs leading to RR closure (Earned Stasis refusing paddle-out); legible cost in "hollow in his chest" foreclosed by inland turn; orientation anchored in first paragraph at kayak launch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Poles as recurring micro-setting constrain choices (counting backward to post office) and charge final image; sensory selectivity (saltwind, kelp tang, whiskey burn) mirrors internal tilt without catalog; choreography clear across launch-post office-bar.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (align/leave vs. stay) signaled early via wavering needle, tightens accumulatively through letter's "ghost with a paddle" deepening knowledge/cost; agency in micro-renunciation forecloses escape with felt lighter chest but scar-map regrets.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of flawed navigation emerges organically from poles-vs-stars particulars, reweighted in final "done following lights that couldn’t lead him home" without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer via dusk step, embracing ambiguity of "just late."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual bias (navigation lens on poles/wires) with rhythmic modulation under stress; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You lost?" / "Just late"), distinguishing bartender without convergence; prose texture character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful navigation metaphors varying rhythm, no loops despite pole recurrence (taught early); minor figurative density in hesitation beat ("tilt, gravitate") coheres without muddle; propulsion clear to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of compass-stars vs. mundane poles transforms redemption trope through grounded coastal specificity; risk in lyric pole-motif payoff heightens stakes without gimmick, inevitable in hindsight via bar compass placement.</comment>
