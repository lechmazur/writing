<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's dry wit and editor's eye shine in tracing condensation into a "delta, a fork," compelling her micro-choices toward the center ice without unearned leaps. Interiority embodied in unflinching hands and deliberate exhale roots her confident embrace of the herald role. Final step forward earns change with foreclosed human path, though subtle contradictions add depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns (condensation, Kael's sketch, vellum) densify toward CR closure: water unfolds with voice naming her herald, paper dissolves rewriting currents. Orientation anchors immediately in outpost and lake. Cost legible in "ice sealed behind her," reconfiguring her beginning with undeniable finality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen lake's "black and glassy" ice constrains her kneel and step, charging final image as it sighs and cracks from invitation. Sensory details (wet stone scent, liquid darkness bloom) filter through her pattern-obsessed gaze, evolving causally with ripples. Rusted outpost groans in relief, mirroring her shift without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rivers' true beginning) signaled early via Kael's note, tightens accumulatively as patterns converge on center ice, narrowing to her palm press and step. Agency in dropping page forces trade-off: old life sealed. Cost felt in reversed river and falcon's empty flight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of created beginnings emerges organically from converging images (tributaries, condensation rivers), reweighted in final "rivers had found their beginning. And Lena Voss... hers" without statement. Complexity lingers in herald's oblique cost, inviting reflection on edited realities.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with water-inflected syntax ("droplets beaded, split, then reunited") delivers distinct perceptual signature of pattern-seeking editor. Stable close-third POV biases toward symbolic deltas, modulating rhythm to charged poise at "water parted... with a voice." No elision or head-hopping obscures closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "ice sighed... crack spiderwebbed outward, not from force but from invitation." Metaphors cohere in water motif without muddle; rhythm varies for ear, though minor figurative density in opening slightly risks overwriting. No loops, clean propulsion to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms atlas editor into herald via pattern-editing lake myth, with rivers "drawn here" inverting maps organically. Risky lyric convergence of condensation, vellum, ice feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
