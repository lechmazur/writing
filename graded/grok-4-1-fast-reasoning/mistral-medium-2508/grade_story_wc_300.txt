<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in the hesitation before pressing the pearl, earned by the accumulating shell confessions that compel her shift from assignment to transformation; interiority embodied in trembling fingers and absorbed weights avoids stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as shell discoveries tighten spiral density toward pearl climax; on-page closure via light unfolding inward reconfigures bunker as womb with cost in ignored radio and forsaken duty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystal veins pulse and feed on confessions, constraining her path and softening stone at climax to charge final digging; sensory hierarchy (crunch, hum, silt) filters through inspector's urgency, mirroring internal radiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find radiance deepens accumulatively via intensifying glow and confessions, forcing agency in pearl press that forecloses report duty with legible cost; hesitation tightens pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of dissolving illusory walls emerges organically from shell particulars shifting to "Wear it. Dissolve the walls," resonating in final image of planted confessions without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in shifting shell words and pulsing crystals; rhythmic prose modulates from damp crunch to resonant hush, sustaining poetic texture under climax stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (shells, light) propels accumulatively without loops; rhythm varies to accelerate at "light unfolded," avoiding overwrites in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pearl as crown synthesizing bunker isolation into connective radiance feels inevitable via shell trail; bold lyric accumulation transforms doomsday trope without hedging.</comment>
