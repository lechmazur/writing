<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Daniel's contradictory impulses—slipping personal memory versus obsessively layering others'—act in scene via collecting and offerings; final shedding choice earned by escalating erasure pressure, with cost in alleys rearranging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragment density builds to CR closure; ledger discovery and bundle-pressing reconfigure identity options with conceptual cost legible in "water closed behind him without a ripple."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Labyrinth containers and tide constrain choices, flooding paths to force heart confrontation; "metal sighed" on insertion charges final image under POV's textural bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of identity reclamation tightens via ledger (own handwriting) deepening knowledge; agency in pressing forecloses return, cost unmistakable in rearranged alleys and closing water.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Erased histories theme emerges organically via fragment absorption; final label-as-gold image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in textures ("corrugated steel, each ridge a vein"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure to closure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with layered syntax propels accumulatively; no loops or muddled figures, varied rhythm peaks at "the first light of dawn caught the label’s edge, turning the faded warning into something like gold."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic ghost trope into textural labyrinth integration feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via fragment constraint on closure.</comment>
