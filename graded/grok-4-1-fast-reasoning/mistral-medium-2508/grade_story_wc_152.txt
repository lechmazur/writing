<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve stories intensifies through micro-choices like feeding the note to the flame and broadcasting, revealing character under pressure. Interiority is concrete via stitching and synchronization, with flaws like deliberate errors constraining actions. Courier applies secondary pressure effectively; endurance at enforcers' arrival feels earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of threads/flame motifs builds to Charged Poise closure as dome shatters and embroidery scatters like seeds. Orientation anchored early in observatory; one tightening via courier's warning narrows options to broadcast. Cost legible in "enforcers had arrived early" as Elias stays smiling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory, loom, telescope, and flame constrain choices (synchronization) and charge final shattering image. Sensory details (needle darting, flame pulsing patterns) filtered through Elias's priorities integrate purposefully. Autumn sky and clockwork evolve causally, mirroring internal unraveling without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve truths vs. coup) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as warning forces broadcast decision foreclosing flight. Agency in synchronization/endurance drives escalation under lens; cost felt in dome's destruction and Elias's stasis amid enforcers. Moral calculus between running and sky-ownership sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of stories' power emerges organically from embroidery/flame motifs shifting to broadcast, reweighting lies with complexity. Final image ("stars were singing") offers resonant non-literal answer to listening vs. silencing without moralizing. Subtext in silences/gestures avoids binaries, embracing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in thread/star metaphors; voice modulates poetically under stress without leakage. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("Magic won’t stop bullets"); rhythm purposeful, diction character-bound. Psychic distance tightens at climax for immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with metaphors (e.g., "bruise against the autumn sky") purposeful and pattern-taught, propelling via varied rhythm. Minor figurative density in climax walls/flame surge risks overwrite but coheres without muddle. No loops/scaffold; propulsion clear to shattering dome.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise of embroiderer broadcasting via flame/telescope transforms conspiracy tropes into fresh synthesis of stories as weapons. Risky poetic structure heightens stakes organically; final seeds image inevitable from thread motifs. No derivative echoes, fully committed to magical realism logic.</comment>
