<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when Elias presses the shell into the pool, embodying grief as both seal and release; final jump earned by layered memories tilting present choice with irreplaceable cost of isolation foreclosed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density tightens from quay paintings to cave pool, culminating in CR closure at "jumped... through—into the cave’s waiting mouth," where conceptual cost of life-for-pause reconfigures time with legible price in villagers' misreading.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent moss and still pool constrain poolside choice and charge final shell image; sensory selectivity (salt tang, held breath) mirrors painterly POV narrowing under promise pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of promise-keeping deepens texturally at shell reveal, forcing endurance trade-off; agency in wrong turn and jump crystallizes with unmistakable cost in burned paintings and perceived suicide.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shell motif shifts from grief-container to endless sunsets, offering non-literal answer to time-as-line vs. pause; resonance emerges organically from cave exhale without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in painterly textures ("brushstrokes ghosting," "colors bled into the pool") modulates rhythmically under stress; stable single POV with purposeful reflective compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and image layering without loops or muddle; figurative coherence peaks purposefully in "water tasted of salt and old promises," charging closure without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via shell-trapped laughter and time-splintering mirror into inevitable "temporary eternity" synthesis; risk of suicide-homecoming heightens stakes organically.</comment>
