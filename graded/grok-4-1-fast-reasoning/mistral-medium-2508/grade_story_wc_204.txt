<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to stabilize the rupture via the forbidden whisper feels rooted in his decades of capturing secrets, culminating in an earned self-realization at "the system wasn’t the world. It was him." Interiority is concrete and embodied (hands don’t tremble, exhaled), with micro-choices under pressure revealing values. Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of unrest (frost patterns → books tumbling → glimpses of other libraries) builds to CR closure where Elias folds the page and steps into clouds, reweighting his role with conceptual cost legible in "the library began to dissolve." Single scene anchors orientation early; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting (glass orchard library, frost-veined windows) constrains choices (patterns signal rupture, press amid shuddering) and charges final image (glass walls running like wax, shattering into starlight). Sensory details selective and POV-biased (humming spines, liquid time ink). Micro-setting of press and bottle evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stabilize negotiable reality) signaled early via frost; escalation via accumulative density (whisper thrashes → library shudders → self-rupture) driven by Elias's agency, foreclosing stability with cost (dissolution into clouds). One decisive tightening at press climax narrows to release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of capturing vs. freeing volatile secrets emerges organically from printing the whisper to "rustling awakenings," reweighted in CR where release wakes the world ("the world, at last, began to rustle"). Final image offers resonant answer without moralizing; particulars like rearranging text drive insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (frost as "veins beneath translucent skin," spines that "hummed"). Voice modulates rhythmically with pressure (short sentences at "The library shuddered"); purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "The ink... siphoned from moments the world had forgotten" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies (read-aloud propulsion peaks at press). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; minor overwrites in opening imagery don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal library-craft premise transforms tropes (floating archive, bottled whispers) via specifics like liquid time ink and self-as-system rupture. Risky CR ending ("the whisper was free") feels inevitable; no derivative echoes.</comment>
