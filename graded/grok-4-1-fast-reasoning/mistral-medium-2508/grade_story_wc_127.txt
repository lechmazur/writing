<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's contradictory impulses—deliver paid-for counterfeit vs. absorb raw truth—act simultaneously when she presses petal to her wrist, earning the final renunciation with embodied cost in "the ache of it was hers too." Chemist credibly flawed by cowardice shown in jagged charge and rewritten memory. Minor slip: chemist borders archetypal without deeper micro-choice distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (static, light shifts, scent unfolding) tightens from setup to Charged Poise closure where petal crumbles and light pools in palms, reconfiguring half-truths with legible emotional cost. Single scene anchored early ("amber grotto hummed at dusk"); no orientation debt. Experimental lyric pattern taught by petal's backward story, pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Amber grotto's pulsing walls and evolving light (gold to molten red) constrain transformation and charge final image: "light settled there, heavy and bright." Sensory hierarchy via Liora's professional bias (static over scent) integrates into action; no white-room, vivid yet economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (counterfeit vs. raw longing) signaled early, deepens accumulatively when static maps "shape of his cowardice," narrowing to Liora's agency in absorbing ache—cost unmistakable in her gasp-hitched breath and endured hollowing. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of half-truths as loneliness emerges organically via petal's knowledge and static's mapping, reweighted in closure image of light in palms without moralizing—"some things couldn’t be counterfeit... if you did the work." Resonant non-literal answer to wanting's cruelty via particulars; no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: biased noticing of charges/pulses ("static build between them"). Voice rhythmic, modulates intensity ("fragrance unfolding like a story told backward"); minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("You want the truth?"). No head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, propulsion in syntax variety; metaphors coherent/patterned (light/heartbeat, static/energy) without muddle, even in peak ("raw, electric sting of wanting"). No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene. Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism (static-sensing emotion distiller) transforms tropes via grounded petal mechanics and conceptual cost of truth. Risky affectionate lyric voice heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight in grotto's "pause between a lie and... truth."</comment>
