<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied scars ("scars on his wrists were roads or warnings") and contradictory impulses to hold/release poem, earning final renunciation; voice-particular poet's flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via timer chimes and storm; CR closure in "He was the cartographer now. And the page was blank" lands legible cost of scattered poem; orientation anchored early, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stormlit dome constrains choice ("ink bleeding where the water seeped through a crack") and charges final washed sky; selective sensory vividness mirrors internal release without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release scars/poem) signaled early, deepens via timer/storm pressure to renunciation turn; agency in tearing forecloses preservation with felt cost, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of scars/words as maps emerges via poem images shifting to blank page resonance; non-literal CR ending reweights censorship without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature ("body is an atlas"); rhythmic control modulates tension to release, purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative coherence (e.g., "sky turned ocean") purposeful for voice, propels to closure without overwriting in peak tear/reset beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of censored poet/storm editing transforms release trope; risk in lyric vigil heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in blank page cartographer.</comment>
