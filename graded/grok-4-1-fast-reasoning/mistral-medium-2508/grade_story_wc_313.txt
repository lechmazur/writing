<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the shift from failed blank photo expunge to nailing personal hand photos, earning the final burning choice with sinking bottle cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density via nailed photos to burning RR/CR closure; cost legible in "The liqueur bottle slipped... sinking without a sound" reconfiguring memory burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ridgeway/reservoir constrains nailing to trees/steeple and charges final rippling vision of Old Hollow; sensory selectivity (damp stone, cloying sweetness) embodies POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expunge vs. share past) tightens accumulatively through photo sequence, foreclosing erasure path with agency in lighting them and legible bottle cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Emergent theme (memory as lifting current) resonates via ashes-into-hands image reweighting reservoir hunger without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("water turned the hue of a held breath") holds stable POV distance, rhythmic control heightens quiet pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; purposeful metaphors cohere in peak (embers floating, ashes as hands) without muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drowned town grief via photo-trail bridge transforms trope; risk in lyric accumulation inevitable at lifting-hands reconfiguration.</comment>
