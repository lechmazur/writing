<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to chase half-remembered past intensifies compellingly through jade press to sternum, embodying certainty amid tremble; interiority concrete in breath shapes and shadow split, earning whole shadow closure without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from breath shapes to jade-revealed memory and final viaduct bloom; closure as Charged Poise reconfigures unused love's storage with felt past-life cost in merged shadow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Viaduct's fog curling ankles and stones humming constrain kneeling choice and charge blooming final image; sensory selection (jasmine, iron-rain scent) reflects Elias's perceptual bias, evolving causally with breath thread.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to locate unused love tightens via jade-induced memory surfacing knowledge, narrowing to breath-woven bridge under Accum lens; agency in deliberate inhale forecloses isolation path with integrated past cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of love's patient storage emerges implicitly from breath thread and rising embers, reweighting premise in non-literal final image of keeper's role without moralizing; counter-reading of waiting's burden lingers via jade's burn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in whispering light and petal-voice; rhythmic modulation accelerates from fog curl to laughing exhale, woman's line carrying subtext of stored accusation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action-image-thought without loops; figurative pattern of twilight-fog-breath taught early coheres without muddle, propelling to jade-weightless dissolve with varied syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera obscura as memory-capture with jade-breath mechanics transforms pilgrimage trope; risk in lyric mysticism heightens stakes via spark-ember payoff, feeling inevitable in viaduct's song.</comment>
