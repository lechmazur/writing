<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora's olfactorily driven precision compels theft-to-planting choices with embodied contradiction (hunger vs. village sway), earning petal-pluck renunciation; Elders' recoil forces relational micro-choice revealing values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via scent/image density to CR closure ("wisdom...just another name for trust"); orientation anchored in first paragraph; bloom-then-Elders tightening reconfigures mirror-realization with exposure cost legible in softening disapproval.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Treetop sway and tide-scent constrain balcony's intimacy and flower's bloom-timing, charging final vine-bridge image; sensory hierarchy (olfactory primacy) mirrors Liora's bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Serenity stake signaled early tightens via perfumed visions narrowing defiance to acceptance; agency in stepping closer amid recoil forecloses isolation with relational cost, though Elders' pivot borders easy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mirror-theme emerges organically from scent-doodles to vine-bridge, reweighting sway-premise without statement; final tea-smile image resonates as non-literal trust-answer, ambiguity in unlocked vault lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical scent-perceptual signature stable in third-person limited; brief Elder dialogue natural/subtextual ("You sought wisdom"); rhythm modulates from coiled tension to embracing hush without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm, but opening's stacked figures ("musk—rotting honey, buried secrets"; "sigh...wet earth and old bones") verge on muddle in high-pressure bloom-beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tide-thought framing transforms sway-trope into trust-mirror via doodle-custom; vine-bridge risk crystallizes fresh undercurrent-synthesis, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
