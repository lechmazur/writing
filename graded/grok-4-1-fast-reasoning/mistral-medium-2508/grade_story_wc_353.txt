<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias's symphonically minded trait yields concrete interiority via "hearing the world in vibrations others ignored," with embodied endurance in "fingers numbed... insulator hot"; final renunciation of the relic earns change with felt cost, revealing value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from faint note to "oak sang... for the bird," delivering Charged Poise closure in siskins' melody reprise; orientation anchors immediately in grove/dawn, no drift; cost legible in abandoned insulator.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Siskin alder grove leans/responses constrain and mirror play, with sculpture's cracks as micro-setting charging choices; sensory hierarchy (vibrations over visuals) reflects Elias's bias, evolving to "vibrated in the marrow" for final resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to voice silent grief tightens via insulator-amplified melody and birds' trill forcing deeper play; agency in persistent strumming forecloses perfection for honesty, with numbing/hot insulator as visible cost charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>"Silence... was waiting" reconfigures premise through emergent song-sharing, with weeping insulator/non-literal pyre image yielding resonant answer to world's muteness; subtext in grove's exhale avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature of sonic embodiment ("lute’s strings hum") stable in third-limited POV, modulating rhythm with pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early holds to closure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion swells with scene ("music swelled, not louder but deeper"), high density in multi-job lines like "insulator thrummed... translating vibrations"; no loops, metaphors coherent/voice-driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tree-song sculpting ingeniously synthesizes relic tech with organic grief, transforming silence trope via crack-strumming; risk in lyric motion-heightening pays off in grove-memory image without gimmickry.</comment>
