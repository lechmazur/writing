<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses, as in laughter as "weapon" amid storm's "lover’s breath," earning stasis in endless climb; flaws like prophetic slip complicate without hedging; voice-specific traits shine in micro-choices like wick-tightening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure in descent with "warm hands" and "counting the hours," reconfiguring routine as bargain under accumulative lens; orientation anchored by ~50 words in climb; density tightens to flare without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lighthouse and wick constrain choices (e.g., "pressed her palm," "twisting it") and charge final image of "wick waiting, its light hungry"; sensory hierarchy (ozone, damp prints) POV-biased and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of shaping dawn vs. shadows' hunger escalates accumulatively via prophetic spill and beam-carving, forcing endurance with cost in "work was never done"; agency in will-bending forecloses easy dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of eternal bargain emerges via shadow-listening reprise, resonating non-literally in final walk without moralizing; complexity in cursed/blessed ambiguity lingers earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (light "bent when you tried to name it"); rhythmic modulation peaks in "shadows stretched, clawing"; stable close-third POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "wick burned lower, its flame dipping... like a drowning man"); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or artifacts even in peak flare.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of herald routine transforming lighthouse trope via shadowed physics and prophetic accident; risk in accumulative elation heightens stakes organically to inevitable bargain image.</comment>
