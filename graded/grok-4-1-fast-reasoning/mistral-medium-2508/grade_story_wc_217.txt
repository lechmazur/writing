<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to coax beauty from fragments drives concrete micro-choices like dipping the feather and retrieving the kite; internal endurance of incompleteness earns final acceptance with visible cost in "temporary" connections, though minimal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limit higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in final line "We are all just woven dawns, coming undone," reweighting incompleteness with conceptual cost of embracing fray; feather as persistent constraint shapes tactics from quill to bridge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon after rain anchors sensory hierarchy and constrains wading/retrieval choices; recurring shallows charge final heron image, mirroring internal "bruise healing" without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harmonizing incompleteness tightens accumulatively when "poem felt alive—not because it was finished, but because it wasn’t," forcing renunciation of completion with legible cost in frayed string on wrist; agency coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in edges emerges implicitly through fragment collection and dawns motif shifting to "coming undone"; final heron image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in noticing "half-remembered melodies... sung underwater" and edge hesitations; rhythmic control modulates from hushed observation to charged hush at "poet smiled," with stable close third-person POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like feather-dipping advancing image/action/atmosphere; minor overwriting from metaphor density in reflective beats ("oil on water," "torn curtain") dulls propulsion slightly without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms fragment-tending into "woven dawns" premise with kite-feather bridge as ingenious charged image; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
