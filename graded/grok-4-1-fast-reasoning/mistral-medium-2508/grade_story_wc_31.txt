<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's obsession with "the color of sound" roots concrete interiority and micro-choices like pocketing the key and lighting his lantern, earning the final reconfiguration without unearned epiphanies. Contradictory routine (lighting lamps) versus pull (entering wreck) acts in scene, compelling higher-stakes making over finding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from pier to library door to frozen sky vision, culminating in CR closure when lighting the lantern dissolves the surreal with conceptual cost (embracing creation over discovery). Orientation anchors immediately; surreal transition pays off without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken library's "brine and old promises" and warped door constrain choices, charging final pier image where waves "shimmer." Sensory hierarchy (creaking hues in bones) reflects lamplighter bias; selective details evolve causally with tide and lanterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering/making color of sound) signaled early, tightens texturally via figure's signing—"The color of sound isn’t found—it’s made"—forcing agency in lighting lantern with visible cost (dissolving vision, changed lamp). One deepening suffices; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truths "waiting" to be made emerges organically from journal to key to lantern release, resonating in final "vow...signed in silence" without moralizing. Returning lanterns shift meaning, reweighting premise with ambiguity (some truths shimmer, unnamable).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, synesthetic perceptual signature ("cobalt despair, amber longing") biases noticing; signing dialogue carries subtext as action. Rhythmic control modulates hush to shimmer without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("lantern swinging like a metronome"); figurative clusters like "violet so deep it ached" purposeful in textural lens, no loops or muddle touching closure. Minor density risks in vision beat don't obscure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic portal via sunken library transforms lamplighter trope boldly; door-to-festival reversal and signing figure synthesize fresh CR payoff. Risky surreal hush heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
