<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's rune scholarship and deliberate traits compel her to slot the key and turn the second despite the automaton's warning, earning her final reconfiguration with embodied defiance in "Good... Then I won’t be alone."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via revelation density from key insertion to door opening, landing CR closure as Elara enters the library with cost in the sealing door and ash key.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory's gears and frost constrain choices, charging final tilt and gnomon keyhole; floating isle anchors nocturnal specificity without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant shadow stake escalates via automaton's coiled darkness and warning, forcing Elara's agency in turning the key under textural lens with legible cost of isolation embraced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Loop-closing motif shifts to opening/kicking doors in final image, reweighting scholarly pursuit into hunger without moralizing, emergent from key and shadow particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias in "fingers tracing... quiet deliberation" modulates rhythm under pressure; automaton dialogue subtextual and distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via "Shadows didn’t vanish... They fed"; minor opening metaphor stack purposeful for textural lens, no loops or drifts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Spooning" and noon-feeding shadows transform cosmic anomaly tropes into observatory-lock premise, with Elara's hunger arc feeling inevitable and risky.</comment>
