<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—stillness vs. lightness—act simultaneously in whittling and screaming; final teaching choice earned by embodied grief carried in bouquet and past subversion. Harkin forces micro-choices revealing values. No unearned epiphanies; flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of motifs (turbines, bouquet) tightens to scream as DC, reconfiguring hush into chosen silence (RR/Charged Poise) with cost in scattered petals and shared grief. Orientation anchored early; lens holds to closure image of whittling under turbines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Turbines constrain scream (swallow it) and charge final image as "slow, indifferent gods"; bouquet/knife as micro-setting evolve tactilely through action. Sensory hierarchy (hush hum, dust, nothing-smell) POV-biased; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate lightness vs. remade hush) signaled early; Harkin/tin deepens pressure, forcing scream agency that crystallizes stance. Cost legible in "raw, ugly sound" foreclosing performed silence; lens-driven escalation coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: refusal to fill silence reweights grief as "light enough to hold" in final whittling image, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in bouquet's "nothing" smell and tin-burning; ambiguity lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (performer's dramatic lens on mundane); dialogue subtextual ("Still carving?" pursuit/evasion). Rhythm modulates to raw scream; no head-hopping, distinct idioms (Harkin's grunts).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, no loops/artifacts; metaphors consistent (turbines as gods/mourning). Rhythm propels: short scream beat vs. breathing whittling close. Opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-Mandate turbines/whittling grief transforms dystopia tropes into textured stasis. Risky quiet reconfiguration feels inevitable; no template echoes, bold voice commits to premise.</comment>
