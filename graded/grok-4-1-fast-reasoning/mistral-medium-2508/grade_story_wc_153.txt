<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority embodied via shard's sting as "tether" and scars fading under moon; contradictory impulses in hesitant first evocation versus bold second earn final letter release with relational cost. Minor abstraction in early backstory ("learned long ago") but anchors present ritual without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from spirits' hum to swelling song, pointed question, silence, then tender reprise; Charged Poise closure in letter's drift and "She had chosen" reconfigures hesitation with undeniable emotional cost on-page. Orientation anchored early in mangroves and ritual; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mangroves' roots tangle ankles at exit, constraining final step free; recurring water as "glass-smooth" and black current charges closure by swallowing letter. Sensory selectivity (salt mist, damp earth, spirits' hum) mirrors internal regret without catalog; body/shard as micro-setting enables healing ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release unsent confession) signaled early via pocket letter; textural escalation in spirits' "What are you waiting for?" forces bolder evocation and physical release, narrowing hesitation with foreclosed path. Cost legible in empty pocket smile; agency in micro-choices tightens once sufficiently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken apology emerges via mist words dissolving then lingering, culminating in non-literal "Some letters didn’t need to be sent to be heard" reweighting silence-as-river image. Resonance from particulars avoids moralizing; ambiguity in sister's unknowable receipt invites reflection with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "spirits sang in spaces between words"; rhythmic modulation swells with pressure (short sentences at shard press) and breathes in closure hum. Poetic compression taught early, legible at release; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/prose jobs (e.g., "exhaled against... fogging the surface" advances ritual); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("curling like smoke," "threading through roots like water through lace") but pattern-taught and purposeful to texture, not obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic realism: gargoyle shard healing parallels Liora's scars, transforming medium trope via mangrove ritual and mist evocation into inevitable release. Risky lyric poise heightens stakes without gimmick; no template echoes, voice commits to fierce tenderness.</comment>
