<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via fretting the watch hand while self-deceiving about fault; final choice to attend tomorrow's date earned by guilt accumulation with visible cost of tipped scales. Interiority concrete and embodied in cold cuff, warm driftwood pulse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from relic guilt to hurling watch, culminating in CR via note discovery that reweights truth-sifting premise with conceptual cost of inescapable confrontation. Orientation anchored early in terrace/shore; closure cost legible in "tipped the scales" and folded note.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt tiles, driftwood carvings constrain choices (kneeling, hurling into surf, splitting reveal) and charge final image of descending steps into dark. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: grooves too precise/crude mirror falsified bloodlines; evolves causally with wave crash.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guilt over withheld truth) signaled early, tightens via agency in hurling watch that yields note, narrowing options under accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable in "weight...had finally tipped the scales" and decision to go despite exposure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sieved hush vs. inescapable truth emerges organically from forging lies to note's tomorrow date, offering resonant non-literal answer in final walk where sea "keeps its secrets." No moralizing; irony in his realization reweights prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (driftwood "almost deliberate," sea whisper "liar"); rhythmic control modulates from measured exhale to shallow breath under note pressure, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (bruise, sifting hush) taught early, propels via varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or muddle even in peak note reveal. Opening anchors voice; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-clinging objects and falsified lineages yields inevitable note-in-driftwood turn from established guilt pattern; poetic risk heightens stakes in CR without gimmickry.</comment>
