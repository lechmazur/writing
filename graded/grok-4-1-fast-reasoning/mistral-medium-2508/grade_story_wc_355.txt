<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses—tuning silences to avoid conflict yet trembling toward action after tracing the diary's hands sketch—earn the final uncurled-hand renunciation with embodied cost in pulse quickening and flinching.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as diary patterns densify to personal question ("What do you do when empathy isn’t enough?"), yielding CR closure in workshop light dying and Elias stepping into street with felt cost of abandoned isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shadowed workshop's beeswax/copper and fireworks embers constrain timing for clasp-opening and force street departure; device as micro-setting charges final mend, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover silence amid encroaching noise) deepens texturally via final diary entry and device's reaction to Elias's own quiet, forcing agency in chair scrape and door step with legible cost of foreclosed passivity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-texture reweights via hands sketch to workshop filling with "careful hands" noise, offering non-literal answer to empathy's limits through charged final image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature fixates on vibrations/pauses idiomatically ("language of pauses"); stable close-third POV biases toward silences, modulating rhythm with fireworks' "staccato heartbeat."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "air between them shivered" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm passes ear test, though minor simile density in opening slightly slows without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence cataloging via frequencies transforms pacifist trope, with diary vibrations yielding inevitable action risk that heightens stakes organically.</comment>
