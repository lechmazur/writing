<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism-mind fracturing into spectra reveals concrete, contradictory interiority under pressure; lunge for jar despite groan shows impulses acting simultaneously, earning shift to "key" with felt cost of sealed chamber.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of patterns deepens to chamber; on-page closure via seed blossoming from smudged margin reconfigures seeker to key, cost legible in blank manuscript and extinguished stars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Quartz teeth, bioluminescent mushrooms, and mist constrain choices via time limit and access; inversion pulls hair upward, charging final plan to plant in grotto's dark.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find combinations signaled via brother's vision; textural deepening in seed recognition forces lunge, narrowing options with snap-back cost that alters tactics to ash ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hidden doors emerging from cessation arises organically via failed grab and seed's internal glow; final image reweights premise without moral, brother's "You're close" resonating through prior grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with prism-mind perceptual signature biases details like pulsing margins; rhythmic compression heightens inversion—"falling upward"—without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "air ripped—not like fabric, but like a held note suddenly released"; zero loops, varied rhythm, no figurative muddle in peak chamber beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inverted gravity, knowledge-seeds, and margin-as-key transforms alchemical tropes; risk in lyric accumulation feels inevitable, seed-between-ribs heightening stakes organically.</comment>
