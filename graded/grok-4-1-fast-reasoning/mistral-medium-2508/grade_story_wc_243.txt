<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via walnut ink and steeping metaphors roots preservation drive; micro-choices like tracing the photo reveal values under pressure. Interiority concrete but lacks sharply contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal ritual beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to Charged Poise closure in "covenant... breathing... that was enough," reconfiguring loss into endurance; cost legible in incompleteness and fading blooms. Orientation anchored first line; one tightening via inking act narrows to stubborn act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Jetty and violets constrain kneeling/inking and charge final "blooms... fading... refused to be forgotten" image; sensory selection (salt, damp earth) POV-biased toward preservation. No generic placeholders; details evolve causally with tide and twilight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (regenerate covenant) signaled early tightens accumulatively through tracing/whispering, foreclosing full restoration with felt incompleteness cost. Agency in endurance alters tactics; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preservation via small moments emerges organically from inking ritual, resonant in final "breathing" image reweighting loss without moralizing. Subtext in haunted euphoria gust layers ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (ink/violet/steep motifs) stable in third-limited POV; rhythmic modulation peaks in "tide... heartbeat, like a promise." No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm variation; no loops or scaffolds—steep motif patterned, not churn. Minor metaphor density in ritual integrates without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh walnut-ink archivist premise transforms memory tropes via proximate causes method; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically to inevitable "breathing" reconfiguration.</comment>
