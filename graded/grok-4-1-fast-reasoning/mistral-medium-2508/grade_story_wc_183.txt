<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to unearth sister roots consistently in scales and swatch as proof, compelling micro-choices like tearing the ledger page; interiority concrete via embodied aberration, with earned shift to communal reclamation at "began to speak," though contradictory impulses act more sequentially than simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density (fog, mirrors, ledger) builds to RR/CR closure in garden step-through and ship's sinking; orientation anchors firmly by first paragraph; legible cost in "rusted heart finally still" reconfigures memory premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ship's warped wood, fog through skylight, and porthole faces constrain ascent to quarters and charge final image as evolving door; selective senses (salt-cotton candy, creaks, black tears) mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of twin recapture signaled early tightens accumulatively to narrative weaving for all lost names, narrowing via ship's resistance; agency in swatch-pressing and story-speaking forecloses escape with fog faces' cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of narrative reclamation emerges from particulars like ink-drinking swatch and name-stitching, resonating in emerald threads pulling souls without moralizing; garden image reweights erasure as door.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual bias toward vivid aberrations (emerald in drowned world); voice rhythm modulates from groan to hum, dialogue sparse but subtextual ("You found me," "We have to go").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion via varied syntax accelerates through creaks and howls to carousel music; high density with multi-job lines, though opening figurative stacking borders overwrought without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Carnival ship's memory labyrinth transforms erasure trope into garden CR, with swatch mechanics offering fresh synthesis; bold aberrant wholeness risks surreal payoff that heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
