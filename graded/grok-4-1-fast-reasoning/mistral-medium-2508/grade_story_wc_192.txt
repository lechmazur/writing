<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between isolation and release act simultaneously as shadow accuses and hand grips wrist, compelling higher-stakes turn of ring; interiority particular via scarred wood memories, with embodied throat-tightening and exhale under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as shadow density increases to pattern break at ring-turn, yielding CR closure via new door and rain-taste air that reconfigures burned bridges' premise with conceptual cost of irreversible letting-go; "didn’t look back" makes before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ashen sanctuary's charcoal/incense air, scarred wood, and starlight pools constrain choices like palm-pressing and ring-turn, charging final door image; sensory hierarchy narrows to vibrations and shadow-breath under encroaching pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of past shadows encroaching tightens accumulatively via unspooling figure and wrist-grip reversal, forcing renunciation agency at ring-turn with visible cost of shuddering release that forecloses isolation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Burned bridges motif shifts from clean silence to smoke-teaching-breath in final image, emergently answering isolation's thematic question with resonant non-literal reconfiguration and lingering ambiguity of new air's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in shadow-breathing and ink-in-rain blurring sustains single-POV stability; rhythmic compression heightens peak wrist-grip without head-hopping or leakage, modulating with emotional poise to charged exhale.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density layers sensory propulsion with varied syntax in peak shadow-encroachment; purposeful metaphor pattern (embers/heart, roots/stone) avoids muddle, though minor density risk in reflective opening slightly tempers rare integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow-keeper lineage and fading threshold transforms ghost-encroachment trope via scarred-wood linking, with ring-turn reweighting inevitable from prior particulars; bold lyric risk heightens conceptual stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
