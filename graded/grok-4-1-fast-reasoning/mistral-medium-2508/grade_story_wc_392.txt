<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's empirical mindset and father's memory anchor motives, driving micro-choices like tracing symbols; embodied calm contrasts shaking hands at wall, revealing contradiction. Final resolve to archives feels earned via prior discoveries. Minor label-speak ("watchfully calm") slightly genericizes interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens: site inspection → whispers → symbols → wall break → realization of erasure → climb to archives forms tight chain with on-page CR closure ("drag it into the light, even if it drowned him too" makes cost legible). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory (damp rust, silt scent, tile vibrations) filters through Elias's professional lens, constraining choices (ladder escape, wall proximity). Tiles and bricks evolve causally, charging final water trickle. Recurring lantern glass constrains climax and mirrors closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover collapse cause) signaled early, tightens causally via wall discovery narrowing to erasure plot; agency in shattering lantern forces trade-off (trickle starts). Cost felt in personal risk ("drown him too"). One reversal sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of unearthing/erasing past emerges via symbols, water, memories without statement; final "The past wasn’t dead. It was just waiting" reconfigures premise non-literally with conceptual cost of indifference. Particulars like Underground Railroad tiles build resonance organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (bone-whispers, stress fractures); rhythmic prose modulates tension (short sentences at wall break). Walkie dialogue natural, goal-driven (Lina pressures return). No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel via strong verbs/images ("swung the lantern hard"); no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in opening scents, but purposeful for atmosphere. Clean grammar, propulsion peaks at "bricks groaned."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of subway history/Underground Railroad with modern erasure via flooding; transforms ghost trope into bone-rhythm. Risky CR closure feels inevitable from empirical build. No derivative echoes.</comment>
