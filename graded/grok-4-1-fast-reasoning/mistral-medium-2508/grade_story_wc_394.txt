<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pip's steadily curious trait drives micro-choices like prying the arrow tip despite past crashes, earning the pivot from falling to conducting with embodied cost in throbbing strut and melted runes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as workshop hums and sea splashes densify to Charged Poise closure—"She wasn’t falling. She was conducting."—with legible cost in snapping chains and tipped structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Acid sea's hiss and workshop's groaning ribs constrain every test leap, charging final perch on ruins where sea burps underscore her evolved poise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Density escalates from repeated splashes through arrow-lashing to workshop's snap, agency in her kicks and cranks foreclosing safe perches with ruin-cost tightening the unheard bell stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fall-to-method reconfiguration in "the first draft" image reweights persistence's endless loop without moral, resonating yearning's complexity through particulars like melted arrow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inventive perceptual signature—"vibration of the thing," "pullled it"—modulates rhythm to peak in crisp "joints locked... arrow tip glowed," stable single POV biasing toward frequencies.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High-density propulsion varies openings and lengths to accelerate "spiraled toward the sea," zero loops or muddled figures dulling the "conducting" shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Obsidian arrow's "hunger" runes fused to yearning algorithm synthesize glitch-art flight myth into inevitable hum on ruins, bold risks heightening without obscurity.</comment>
