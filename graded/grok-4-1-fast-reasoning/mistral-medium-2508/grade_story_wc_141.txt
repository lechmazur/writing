<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (debunking vs. secret prayer) act in scene via pressing shell and playing cello; final shift to myth keeper earned by causal buildup of voices with cost of blank shell. Gloomy cheerfulness embodied in "jagged" laugh and "louder this time." Interiority concrete and particular throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of hum → memory → conversation → chorus reconfigures riddle as ledger; CR closure via blank shell and skin-writing with felt cost of dissolved journal. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. One tightening via "decoding" play suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory/cracked dome, warped floor, cliff edge constrain choices (new journal starts there) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (hum shivers rafters, dust shakes) reflects urgency. Micro-settings (cello, shell) evolve causally. Recurrent wind/sea mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode riddle) signaled early, tightens via hum's deepening to voices forcing renunciation of solving; agency in bow-drag "scraping rust" forecloses buster path with legible cost (blank shell, gone journal). Accumulative cadence shift reweights under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (harmonize with myths/ledger) emerges organically via chorus voices; final image ("riddle answers back" on skin) offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Shell's blanking carries conceptual cost. No tidy resolution, ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("accidental poet of half-truths," salt-on-skin cling) and rhythmic control heighten pressure; stable close third-person with lyric compression taught early pays off in charged closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "hum wasn't a memory—it was a conversation"); figurative pattern (dissolving pages, flaking paint) coherent and purposeful, no loops or muddle at peak "decoding" beat. Minor overwrite in openings doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-busting via cello/shell hum transforms tropes; bold lyric risk (voices as chorus) heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via "add to it" reconfiguration. No derivatives, singular vision.</comment>
