<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in belief despite scar and drone risks, shown in micro-choice to cross median "like a man with nothing to hide"; internal ache embodied during storm unfold. Lira applies pressure via directions and laugh. Minor slip in epiphanic abstraction ("map... where the cracks had been") avoids full 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from bottle carry to alley unfold to post office sigh, with CR closure ("storm sighed, then stilled... letter fluttered") reweighting smuggling as memory delivery; cost legible in "drones hummed overhead, closer now." Two clean shards with legible transition; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via drone patrols ("seven-minute gap") and alley shadows; twilight violet bleeds pressure into timing. Bottle as micro-setting charges final image ("warm against his ribs"). Sensory hierarchy (scent of rain, thrum) POV-filtered through Elias's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver storm across border) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via unfold revelation ("they’re waiting") narrowing to post office run; agency in release and delivery forecloses safe path with drone cost ("warnings bleating").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of healing via exposed cracks emerges organically from storm ("showed you where the cracks had been") and letters ("waiting"); final CR image ("absences linked up like constellations") reweights premise non-literally with ongoing cost, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable 3rd-limited Elias with perceptual signature (drone rhythms, handwriting like mother's); dialogue subtextual ("terrible smuggler"/"respectfully rebellious") advances stakes. Rhythmic control modulates from hush to thunder peel under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels (e.g., storm "unfolded, a slow peel"); figurative coherence taught early pays off at closure without muddle. Minor density in metaphors ("thunderstorm in a bottle") caps below 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of postman smuggling bottled storm as promise-healer transforms border trope; risk in poetic compression heightens resonance ("delivering the storm... until the broken things found each other"). Inevitable in hindsight via note setup.</comment>
