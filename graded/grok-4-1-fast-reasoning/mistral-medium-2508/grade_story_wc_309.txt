<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marlin's motivation rooted in candle's whisper drives climb and rejection of deans' praise; contradictory impulses (penance vs. stubborn glow) act in scene, earning final renunciation with cost of institutional exile. Woman's pressure reveals his blind spots without safety-hedging. Minor slip: epiphany line "The sacred in the simple" borders on overt diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light/frost patterns builds to CR closure in merged lights and "Louder" whisper, reweighting automation vs. imperfect sacred with conceptual cost of forgetting. Orientation anchored early in spire exile; keystone brush tightens via mist shift without breaks. Cost legible in keystone left behind.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frost-stiff robes, frostbloom archway, pulsing keystone constrain climb and charge final candle merge; recurring frost-gold veins mirror internal shift. Sensory hierarchy (numb fingers, howling wind) reflects Marlin's priorities. Pocket garden as micro-setting enables impossibility accommodation pivotal to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve keystone amid defect stigma) signaled early, deepens via whisper and woman to sacred-in-stubborn; one tightening (keystone touch) narrows via mist/revelation under Accumulative lens. Agency in ignoring deans forecloses validation path with felt cost in unruly flame vs. hollow hymn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of sacred in simple emerges from particulars (unextinguished candle, keystone glow, frost patterns) reweighting automated creation; final roaring flame offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in woman's "mastery's just another kind of forgetting" charges irony of return.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (light as memory/cling); diction/rhythm modulates from howling wind to humming petals to roaring flame. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("You're late," "Some things aren’t for explaining") advances stakes; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short punchy summit, breathing garden); high density in "veins of gold in the ice, patterns in the frost—meanings." Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("jagged tooth... choir of disapproving mentors") but purposeful/voice-motivated, no loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of automated creativity vs. imperfect sacred transforms mage trope via lingering luminance and mist-walking folly; risk in quiet CR closure heightens stakes. Final "Louder" defiance inevitable from candle seed.</comment>
