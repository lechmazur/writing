<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in hesitation ("It’s not mine to give") resolved by micro-choice to give her own spiral, earning change with felt cost of release. Embodied emotions via palm-held nest and exhaled breath under temple pressure. Voice particular to her worldview of secrets as "half-finished constellations." Final dream twig seals earned arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (orbs, ripples, spirals) builds to CR closure in dream where orbs dissolve into "something that could not be held but could always be found," reweighting possession with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early (walkway, temple, pond). One tightening via second spiral deepens stake. No lens ambiguity or debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via installation's orbs demanding surrender, charging final dream image of temple petals inscribed with letters. Sensory vivid/POV-filtered (wet stone, crushed petals, thrush shadow). Micro-objects like twig spiral evolve with lily pond ripples mirroring internal unfurling. No white-room; lived-in choreography clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rejoining secrets) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via first-then-own spiral gifts narrowing possession options with emotional cost legible in "recognizing that some secrets were never meant to be kept." Agency in placements forces renunciation. No abstract stakes; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of secrets/threads emerges organically from particulars (drafts chest, orb spirals, monk's line, dream dissolution), resonant CR in thrushes dropping orbs reweighting without moral. Subtext in silences/gestures; ambiguity lingers plausibly. Protagonist arc inextricable; no sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (poetic noticing of "concentric rings," "yarn unraveling"). Rhythm modulates intensity; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Nothing is"). No head-hopping; diction biased to Liora's secretive lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "orbs catching light like held breath" advances atmosphere/character/stakes). Varied rhythm flows read-aloud; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures. Propulsion clean through peak (dream) unbeclouded.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: love-letter ghostwriter rejoins secrets via twig spirals in orbs transforms keeper trope into prismatic release. Risky lyric accumulative structure pays off in dream CR without gimmick. Irreplaceable particulars (thrush shadows, dissolving orbs) feel inevitable.</comment>
