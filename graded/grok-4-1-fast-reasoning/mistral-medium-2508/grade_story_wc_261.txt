<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied via scar pulsing with plant whispers and twitching fingers; contradictory impulses peak in urge to decode mother's file versus letting ache undecoded; final renunciation earned through fern's memory and file revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density (plants to stone to self-as-wound) builds to CR closure; cost legible in "let the scar on her collarbone ache without trying to decode it"; single scene coherent with hourglass reprise paying off frozen time.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower's frost-laced window and whispering ivy constrain choices (ear to wall, archive door creaks open); recurring hourglass charges final image as sand runs out; sensory hierarchy biased to tactile/auditory scars mirrors POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of scar-reading signaled early tightens accumulatively via plant telepathy deepening to self/mother realization; agency in turning hourglass and writing on file forecloses decoding path; visible cost in tower shuddering and dust settling charges poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wounds holding time emerges organically from scar/coffee rings/fern memory; final image ("tunnel...into the hush where questions could breathe") reweights premise without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to closure-seeking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (ring-tracing bias) stable in single tight POV; rhythmic modulation accelerates in "sand hissed" and breathes in dawn hush; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (splinter tower, bled sand); minor figurative density in reflective beats but propels to closure image without muddle; no loops, strong propulsion in "The archive door creaked open on its own."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tumor-surgery telepathy transforming scar-reading trope into self-as-tunneling-wound; risk-taking lyric escalation inevitable in hindsight via hourglass/plant reprise; bold hush-tone heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
