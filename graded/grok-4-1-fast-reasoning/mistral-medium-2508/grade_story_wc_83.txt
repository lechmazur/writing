<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and contradictory—pulse hammering yet finger hovers amid warnings—earning shift from survivor to perturbation; geode embodiment roots motivation in father's gift without epiphanies. Final choice compelled by intensifying traits under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflective shards build density to console activation, resolving in CR via vision ("I do") and cold geode as cost; orientation anchored para 1, one tightening at frequency key-in shakes options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Geode as micro-setting constrains console choice and charges final cold exhale; dome groan/storm sensory hierarchy narrows to immediacies, mirroring internal hunt without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (hunt pooled potential) signaled early, agency-driven escalation via geode placement despite "stop" tightens to finger-hover trade-off; cost legible in alarms/field collapse risk and indifferent storm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (hunted potential in unmade past) emerges via lattice threads shifting to wedding vision; final exhale reweights premise non-literally, inviting ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (reality flickers, geode pulses); rhythmic diction ("intangibly tangible") modulates under stress, intercom dialogue subtextual and sparse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm—no loops, purposeful figurative lattice resolves chaos; peak clarity at "screen went white" propels without overwrite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perturbation theory transforms time-rewind trope into hunted threads; geode synthesis feels inevitable, bold risks (non-causal CR) heighten stakes organically.</comment>
