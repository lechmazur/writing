<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to translate silence roots in consistent traits like pattern-correlating and fear of invisible stakes, culminating in an earned renunciation of exile's weight via passing the stone. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. playing) act in the nexus pulse beat. Girl's pressure forces micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. Minor slip: embodied emotion leans abstract in "weight in his chest felt lighter" without tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via nexus tremors, motifs, girl's arrival as pattern break, cadence shift to board's luminous realignment. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with conceptual cost of accepting uncertain "phases" over fixed rules, reconfiguring covenant. Single scene anchored by ~100 words; no orientation debt. One tightening via nexus pulse narrowing to play decision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus constrains choices (pieces tremble, air shimmers as knight paths), charging final image where field shifts alignment. Twilight shadows and cracked earth filter through Elias's chess lens, selective to tremors vs. visuals. Sensory hierarchy matches POV urgency; tactile hum grounds. Minor genericism in "cracked earth" but purposeful mirroring of fractured covenant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating silence into legible beauty amid fear of play) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via girl's board and nexus pulse forcing stance crystallization. Agency in pawn hesitation then move forecloses inaction with felt cost of vulnerability. Pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise; no reversals needed. Coherent under lens but escalation leans deepening over sharp narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in gaps/silences emerges organically from chess gaps, nexus pauses, untranslated promises, reweighted in jagged luminous pattern without statement. Subtext in girl's "nexus remembers about us" invites ambiguity on covenants' endurance. Final image answers "why count spaces" via breathing game, resonant non-literal. Avoids tidy moral via lingering phases.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with Elias's perceptual signature (tremors as game patterns, dent as flaw/art). Voice texture distinct in syntax rhythm modulating to dry laugh dissolving into twilight. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("You're afraid" pursues truth, advances to play). Girl's idiom distinct (child direct vs. Elias measured); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., stone tracing anchors worry/motif). Rhythm varies, read-aloud ear strong. Prose propels via image integration but overwriting in high-pressure nexus pulse ("pregnant, thick with the weight of choices not yet made") mixes metaphors slightly (−0.4). Minor paraphrase loop in silence motifs early; no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess exegesis at magnetic nexus transforms gambit tropes into covenant memory via bone/stone pieces aligning jaggedly. Risk in lyric Accumulative lens heightens stakes of forgotten rules without gimmick. Irreplaceable dent/flaw as art pivot. Non-obvious angle on play's beauty in pauses elevates beyond template tutor redemption.</comment>
