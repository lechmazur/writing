<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied moments like seeds "weaving through her skin like threads of a story half-told" and blood glowing blue, revealing contradictory wonder and urgency; final realization earned by mounting tactile engagements without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as shard memories, sprouting seeds, and surging recollections densify to Charged Poise closure at "She let them in," reconfiguring paths-inside-her with heart-heavier cost legible in satchel's weight and cave's sigh.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Geode's iridescent walls and crater glass constrain choices (ear pressed, glass gathered) and charge final image as cave seals; sensory bias (humming shards, opalescent mist) mirrors her transliteration perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim paths before fade) tightens via bird's "hurry" shadows and time-thief urgency, culminating in memory-wave agency that forecloses isolation at felt cost of "heart heavier with... half-remembered lives."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hidden paths emerges organically from shards' divergences and seeds' possibilities, resonating non-literally in final "missing pieces had found their way home" without moralizing, reweighting conjecture via blood-tide image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (emotions as colors/hues) modulates rhythm under pressure, stable single POV; compression of mist-dissolving paths teaches pattern paid off in echoing laughter and brighter world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors (e.g., "roots weaving through her skin") without muddle or loops; peak surge beat accelerates cleanly to "She let them in."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-crystals and sea-foam seer transforms divergence tropes into iridescent inevitability, risking lyric boldness in geode-breathing world that heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
