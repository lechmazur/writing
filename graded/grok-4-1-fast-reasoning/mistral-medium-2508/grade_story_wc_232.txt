<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's empirical skepticism contradicts his intuitive pull to the chip, embodied in hesitation and smeared glow on fingers, earning the final path choice with visible cost of foreclosing his shop life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds via chip glow, ants, symbols to CR closure in "Elias chose the second" with conceptual cost of 23 years late; orientation anchored by ~50 words, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cavern's bioluminescent fungi and rising creek constrain choices, mirroring internal shift; final glow residue on skin charges closure image as persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (doorway via promise) tightens accumulatively via creek roar narrowing options; agency in pressing palm forces door with felt cost of old life sealed behind.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of promises as doorways emerges organically from chip, child sob, wet-ink map; final image reweights premise without moralizing, lingering ambiguity of woman's identity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual bias (parchment-scale mind on mystic fungi); rhythmic modulation peaks in "The symbols stilled," no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propel via integrated sensory propulsion; no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures like "foxfire trapped in metal" enhance without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of printer myths, iridescent ants as guides, chip-matrix magic transforms tropes; risk in surreal door payoff inevitable from setup, heightens emotional stakes.</comment>
