<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to restore stories intensifies convincingly through micro-choices like inviting the girl and broadcasting her words; contradictory risk-belief impulses act in the knock-door moment. Girl applies immediate pressure without stereotyping. Final flight earned by prior broadcasts' spread.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure: empty alcove, spreading phrase reconfigures famine premise with Elias's departure cost ("quill left behind like a promise, the inkwell dry"). Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist, dust, radio glow recur to constrain (mist curls listening, glow siphons/dims) and charge final image ("scrawled in ash and salt and the stubborn glow"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (broadcast vs. Ministry) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via girl's transcript-turned-broadcast narrowing options; agency in "Come in" and mic-sharing forecloses safety with flight cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of persistent stories emerges via dust/mist images shifting from passive to agentic; final "dust began to sing" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting famine without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature ("mist coiled through the cracked windows, thick as regret") biases noticing; stable third-close POV, rhythmic control modulates with girl's arrival tension. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (no muddle in peak girl-beat); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops/scaffold. Minor overwriting in mist repetitions taught as pattern.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh dystopian synthesis: dust-as-storyteller transforms broadcast trope, dust-girl linkage inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in lyric CR heightens conceptual stakes.</comment>
