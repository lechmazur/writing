<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation to uncover why she echoes drives consistent micro-choices like pressing the shell to her ear and singing, earning the renunciation; Kaelis applies relational pressure as traitor. Interiority embodied in pulse quickening and grip tightening. Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously slightly limits 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hybrid Causal/Accumulative lens holds: shell's disclosures cause descent, building textural density of echoes/revelations to on-page Decisive Change (threads snap) and Conceptual Repricing (echoes as answers). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure cost legible in shell's silence and her isolation as universe quiets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Serpentine nexus with bioluminescent veins and arranged bones constrains descent choices and mirrors internal unraveling; starlight charges climax (fills Kaelis's eyes) and final hurl into abyss. Sensory details (cool stone, copper air) selective via Veyra's perceptual bias. Recurrent ribs/threads evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn echo origins) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via shell/carvings/bones/Kaelis to agency-driven climax (singing snaps threads). One tightening forecloses Kaelis's control with visible cost (his scream, her renunciation). Cost unmistakable in final isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of listening's cost emerges organically from particulars (warped lullaby echo, threads as answers); final hurl reconfigures premise (universe's song quieter) without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer to "why echo?" in wind-only return.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (noticing echoes/hums); voice lyrical and biased toward sonic textures, modulating rhythmically under pressure (short sentences at climax). Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven ("Why do some of us echo?"). No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety; metaphors consistent in sonic motif (hum, sigh, groan) without muddle in peak beats. Minor figurative density in opening risks slight opacity, but purposeful for tone; no loops or scaffolds dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echoes as universe replies spun into nexus threads transforms betrayal trope; risk-taking in lyric descent structure heightens perceptual stakes. Inevitable hindsight from shell's progressive clues to snap.</comment>
