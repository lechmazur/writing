<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in thorn pain grounding her amid father's urging to leave; final endurance earned via micro-choices like tying sandbag strip, foreclosing outside path with isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density tightening to Charged Poise closure (ear to earth amid burning world); orientation anchored in first paragraph's dome/tower fall; cost legible in fissure and refusal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dome and roses as micro-setting constrain choices (fissure pressures patch, plants dictate next via listening) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy POV-biased to blooms' breath over chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor continuity) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via sandbag crack narrowing to inward endurance; agency in carving/tying forecloses chaos path with felt isolation cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of quiet outlasting chaos emerges organically via particulars (knife-to-whisper, thorn-weave); final image (ear to roots) reconfigures premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity of plants' "perceptive silence."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (plants breathing/thrumming, father-etched quiet); rhythmic modulation builds lyric compression to charged ending poise without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric figures (sandcastle boot, thorns biting thighs) supporting tone; varied rhythm avoids loops, though rose recurrence borders ornamental in mid-section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh pacifist-gardener synthesis transforms post-fall trope via engraved phrases and dome anchor; risk in tranquil lyricism heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
