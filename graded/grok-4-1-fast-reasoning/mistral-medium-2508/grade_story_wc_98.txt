<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pocketed seed despite known mind-cost reveals hierarchy of values; contradictory fear ("cost was her own mind") and duty act simultaneously, earning integration as island's voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds to CR in "dreams weren’t echoes... island itself, trying to remember her," reweighting premise with cost in "ridge’s pulse in her bones"; orientation anchored by ~50 words, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ridge constrains pre-monsoon planting and highest-point stance; charges closure as it "trembled in agreement," with pulsing seeds and nightshade integrated tactilely through digging and biting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to sever dream-hold tightens via seed ingestion under textural lens, agency foreclosing personal mind with trade-off; cost unmistakable in journal echo realized as "weight of a thousand years pressing behind her eyes."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>CR reweights individual vs. collective memory through revelation; final violet-stained smile offers non-literal answer, emerging organically without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature in "taste like the first question ever asked" biases mythically; stable close third modulates rhythmically to peak laugh, child's dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density propels revelation beat (e.g., blurred-to-sharpened vision); varied syntax and coherent metaphors like "sap in her veins" maintain propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes transformed via living-memory ridge and mind-rewriting seeds into inevitable CR; island remembering her inflects freshly from particulars.</comment>
