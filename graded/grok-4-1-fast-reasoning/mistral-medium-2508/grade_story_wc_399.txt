<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like pressing palm to parapet and feeling its pulse as a second heartbeat, reveal contradictory endurance against prophet's echoes. Motivation rooted in line-walker history compels consecration with visible cost in temporary hold. Blind spots to followers' sigils complicate without safety-hedging. Voice specificity shines in peripheral sensing, earning 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fraying edges to parapet's song sharpening borders, landing Charged Poise closure—"I can hold it long enough"—with legible cost in fragile pocket of stillness. Single scene, orientation anchored early (Lysan at clearing's edge). No disorientation debt; pattern pays off at ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (crushed mint, old word scent, silk ripples without wind) filters through Lysan's bias, constraining consecration via parapet's warm curve. Recurring dunes/clearing edges evolve causally, mirroring internal states and charging final image where borders hold steady. Micro-setting (parapet, mask) shapes choices; 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wisdom's echo) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via parapet's thrum forcing endurance/renunciation, with felt cost in chest weight easing only "just enough." Agency in recalling silence narrows options against prophet's fraying. One deepening suffices; price legible in "can't hold it forever."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of peripheral wisdom vs. fervent fire emerges organically from consecration events, reweighted in final image of stubborn hum and desert memory without moralizing. Subtext in voice's regretful warning and Lysan's reverent touch invites ambiguity on survival's fragility. Resonant non-literal answer to preservation question; 9+ test satisfied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, with perceptual signature in whispers/murmurs biasing notice (e.g., "dunes whispered long before"). Rhythm modulates intensity, diction purposeful (e.g., "half-glimpsed"). Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven ("You’re late"); distinct from narration. No head-hopping; elisions taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "parapet groaned, then sang" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies, read-aloud flows. Purposeful repetition (murmuring, whispers) builds texture without loops. Minor overwriting in metaphors (e.g., "blade" mask) cohesive; no artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lyric fantasy: kinetic relic, half-mask honesty, whisper vs. fire reconfigures preservation trope organically. Risky calm tone heightens subtle stakes; final "desert would remember" inevitable in hindsight. Non-obvious angle on wisdom's survival elevates; 9+ test met.</comment>
