<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the shift from encoding the spiral question to slamming the rest symbol, earning the final renunciation with embodied cost in seared palm and raw throat; interiority particular via grandmother link without stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as symbol density and graffiti response build to on-page DC closure via bolt plate slam dissolving the ghost, with legible cost in inverted mist and throat rawness; orientation anchored early in courtyard perch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bolt plate constrains pivotal slam while mist coils ankles and graffiti peels, charging final quiet lanterns; sensory hierarchy (ozone, chalk scrape) reflects heightened perception without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (articulating ghost's need) tightens accumulatively as chalk deepens and ribs pressure, forcing agency in rest symbol and slam with unmistakable cost reconfiguring options into charged silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of pressing silence into endurance emerges organically via flower press parallel and child graffiti reprise, offering non-literal CR in valley glow without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (hearing code in static/graffiti shifts) and rhythmic modulation under pressure sustain clean third-limited POV, with purposeful compression paying off in mist-swallowed exit.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates metaphors (wet silk air, stone peeling like paper) without muddle or loops in peak slam beat; varied rhythm propels to thunder with no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ghost-in-code premise synthesizes folklore and tech via graffiti encoding, with fresh risk in courtyard server-room hybrid transforming tropes; child coda inevitability heightens stakes.</comment>
