<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory terror and compulsion embodied in digging nails to blood and singing through burning throat earn the final release; interiority particular via trapped memories like blacksmith's gasp. No unearned epiphanies; change forecloses her isolation with communal harmony.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as song density builds to world's responsive harmony, delivering Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "It wasn’t just the realm that had been dying. It was her." Orientation anchored early in greenhouse; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mica windows and alchemical trees constrain choices—palm pressed, light seeps—charging final shattering; endless night presses in, mirroring internal starvation. Sensory hierarchy urgent: soil blood, leaf quiver, golden spill. No white-room; lived-in via root breath, fogged panes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to rekindle via songs tightens texturally as mica flickers to glow, forcing endurance; agency in louder singing despite crack yields harmony back, with throat-pain cost unmistakable on page and her dying realized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Binding via song reknits what greed swallowed, emergent in memories (braiding hair, baker feeding) to villagers joining; final "weaving would never stop" reweights isolation-to-community without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual bias via memory shards (laughter trapped); rhythm modulates from hushed to trembling crescendo, diction purposeful without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with metaphors coherent (memory as smoke curling, leaves as net); no loops, scaffolds, or muddle—rhythm propels via varied openings, peaking clean in "mica windows shattered... sweetening the dawn."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms dying-world trope via mica-trapped memories and alchemical orchard specifics; bold accumulative lyricism risks poetic density but heightens stakes, inevitable in song-world reciprocity.</comment>
