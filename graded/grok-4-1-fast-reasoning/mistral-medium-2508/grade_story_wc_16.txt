<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in "carefully reckless" trait propel her calculated leap to sing amid pulsing inkwell; final trust in her voice earned via prior revelations tying her name to vows. Interiority particular and degraded under stress without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from ink's bruise-like bloom through pulsing to shattered release and restored Chorus humming in walls; RR closure with conceptual cost in "gave it a future" and sharp shard, options reconfigured before dawn torches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Archive as loom constrains via scrolls/ink revealing obligations; inkwell's shatter and shard charge final image, sensory hierarchy (violets/decay to iron breath) mirrors stakes. Micro-setting (glass shard humming in pocket) evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore before burning) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via personal vow revelation narrowing to desperate song; agency in palm-to-parchment crystallizes stance with inkwell cost, emissaries' torches tighten pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unbroken threads/trust emerges from vow-obligations and singing gaps; resonant non-literal answer in "first true sentence of the rest of her life" reweights silence as gestation. Minor overtness in repeated "point was" phrases tempers peak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable with perceptual signature of harmonic gaps/sensory weave; rhythm modulates from deliberate dips to mist-coiling crescendo, diction biased toward scholarly mythos without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "indigo bloomed like a bruise... revealing obligations"); purposeful figurative pattern (threads/loom/symphony) taught early avoids muddle, but final-paragraph paraphrase loops ("point was," "silence... pause") dull closure slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguist-as-restorer via vow-threads and sylph-ink transforms trope; risk in voice-weaving payoff inevitable from prior particulars, non-obvious premise commits fully without retreat.</comment>
