<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied interiority peaks in "sundial grew warm... shadow didn’t point north. It pointed inward," driving contradictory chase vs. release impulses to earned ledger drop with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density through image cadence (canal split, marsh nudge, inward shadow) to CR closure in ledger drop and "learning to squint" realization; cost legible in "weight... lighter" and foreclosed past.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sundial as recurring micro-setting constrains perception and charges closure image; marsh "wet earth and decay" mirrors internal upheaval while barge choreography (nudge, tie off) guides pivotal choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth-chase tightens accumulatively via shadow reversal and radio crackle, forcing renunciation agency; ledger drop forecloses path with emotional cost, though external pressure remains subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of lies as scaffolding emerges organically from sundial inscription shift to "hindsight... learning to squint," reweighting prior quest without moralizing; final barge-into-light image resonates as non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in light/shadow/water biases; rhythmic diction modulates serene build to charged poise, no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image integration, but minor metaphor density ("blade" repeat, "smoke" curl) slightly muddles peak realization beat without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sundial-canal synthesis transforms introspection trope into serene quest reweighting; marsh detour and inward shadow offer fresh, inevitable inflection on buried truths.</comment>
