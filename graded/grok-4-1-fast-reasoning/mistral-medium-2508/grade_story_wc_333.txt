<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Locksmith's rule versus the hair's pulse creates contradictory impulses acting in scene; her memory of mother's locket anchors interiority and earns the final choice to let the locked thing decide, with cost in her unopened locket.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to ribbon unraveling into map; CR closure lands on page via thumb to map's center, reweighting locks with conceptual cost legible in "the boldest act wasn’t opening, but letting the locked thing decide."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nexus shop and starlight constrain choices, with skylight star charging final image; sensory details (ozone, parchment) filter through locksmith's priorities, evolving causally as walls dissolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to open hair tightens via map expansion, narrowing to idea's freedom; agency in listening/exhaling forecloses man's expectation, with cost felt in shop's storm and her pocketed locket.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of protective locks emerges organically from hair/map question "What if the lock was never meant to keep me in, but to keep the world out?"; final image of frayed ribbon/locket offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in lock metaphors; rhythmic prose modulates under pressure (e.g., "exhaled and listened"), dialogue sparse but subtextual and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative language purposeful and coherent in peak "air thick with ozone and old parchment," propelling to closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hair-to-map synthesis transforms locksmith trope into fresh CR on enveloped secrets; risk-taking in cosmic dissolution heightens stakes, feeling inevitable from meteorite pick onward.</comment>
