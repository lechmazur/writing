<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liam's interior contradiction shines in the lake reflection showing past selves, compelling the throw as an earned renunciation of erasure with embodied cost (throat tightens). Micro-choices like flexing fingers and carrying the ball reveal values under pressure. Minor diagnostic echo in lake's voice ("Empathy isn’t something you get") slightly abstracts without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tunnel glow to lake reading, culminating in Charged Poise RR as ball-throw parts water with collapsing tunnel cost. Orientation anchors early (post-procedure wrist). One tightening at reflection narrows to throw-or-drop, reconfiguring path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake constrains pivotal choice, flaring at touch and parting on throw to charge final image. Sensory hierarchy (warm water, ozone scent) filters through jaded POV, evolving causally. Ball as micro-setting enables grip against damp.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kindle empathy vs. retain past) signaled early, tightens at lake voice/revelation forcing throw that forecloses erasure with tunnel collapse cost. Agency in hurl across glow narrows options under Accumulative lens. Moral calculus between drop (forget) and throw (rebuild) viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of given empathy emerges via shifting images: frayed ball from past to path-maker, lake mirror to chess board, reweighting "labyrinth" without statement. Final "I’m here to start" offers non-literal resonance to procedure's hollow promise. Complexity in flawed seeker lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (veins pulse, air tastes possibility) biases details jadedly. Prose rhythm modulates tension, compressing at throw ("sighed"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You here to finish it?"), advancing closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels: every line layers sensory/pressure without loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies (short throw sentences accelerate), metaphors coherent (comet tail light). Minor overwriting in opening metaphors doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neural scrub, time-traveler ball, choice-labyrinth lake transforms redemption trope via specific acts (coded headlines guide to empathetic rebuild). Risky poetic compression pays in charged chess poise. Inevitable hindsight from Morrow's "hinges."</comment>
