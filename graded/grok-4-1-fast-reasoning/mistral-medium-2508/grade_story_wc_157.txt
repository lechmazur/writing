<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's charm shines in the grin amid uprooting threat, rooting defiance in consistent rogue traits with micro-choices like replacing dandelion. Secondary characters apply pressure via questions but remain sketched without deepening relationships. Final endurance earned but lacks deeper internal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from gourd split to sprouting messages, culminating in Charged Poise/CR at "morning glory twining... now" with conceptual cost of untaxable rebellion undeniable in final image. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse; shards legible via time markers like "three weeks later." Persistent plant constraint shapes tactics through closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse and gardens vividly constrain choices—drones avoid community plots, enabling syntax patterns; sweat-darkened collar embodies tactility. Final swaying plants as conspirators charge closure image, mirroring internal defiance. Sensory selection (damp earth, crushed mint) purposeful and POV-biased toward botanist's eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of coded rebellion signaled early; tightening at black-eyed Susans/dandelion warning forecloses bold action, forcing rosemary caution with felt adaptation cost. Pressure coheres accumulatively to final "now," agency in planting/humming persists. Minor abstractness in city "burn" but on-page pollen/leaf curl viscerally escalates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of untaxable thought emerges organically from plant syntax events; final image of defiant spark reconfigures taxable world premise without moralizing, resonant CR reweighting rows/leaves as rebellion. Subtext in "speak in roots" implies via action, not statement. Complexity in Auditors' blind spot lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in cryptic, plant-infused diction ("warp the soil into syntax") biases toward Elias's rogue lens; POV stable third-close, no hopping. Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("And if they dig it up?"), natural rhythm advances plot. Rhythmic modulation heightens to humming under drone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency, high density integrates sensory/action (e.g., "hands pressing seeds into the dirt"); minor figurative density in opening but purposeful for voice, no loops or scaffolds dulling propulsion. Final line's image resolves with charged cadence. Clean mechanics, no artifacts in peak planting beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxed thoughts and botanical code transforms dystopia tropes via specific garden mechanics and gourd seed arc; risk in cryptic voice/plant language heightens stakes organically. Final CR inevitable from established particulars, no hedging—bold conceptual commitment.</comment>
