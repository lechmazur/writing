<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lior's curiosity drives her into the bunker despite riddles and pulsing seal, with contradictory fear and wonder embodied in shaking hands and synced pulse; transcendence earned when she reaches the wall, sacrificing certainty via ash.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of revelations (film, murals) builds to CR closure where path chooses her, cost in seal's ash and dissolved bunker legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vines, roots, and storm constrain choices, charging final image as metal dissolves to loam/sky; sensory hierarchy (ozone, thrumming bones) mirrors internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interpret dream/path choice) signaled early via terminal; density deepens to foreclose certainty, agency in pressing seal and storm-touch with ash as cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of paths' hunger emerges via film/murals; final "path stepped back, then forward—a dance" reweights premise non-literally with acceptance's ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual bias (riddles, writhing vines); rhythmic modulation peaks in "thunder laughed," distinct from mural-Lior's wind-leaves voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; "vines lashing out, pulling dream-Lior" propels escalation without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh inversion of bunker refuge into path-test; surreal dissolve and dancing path synthesize dream-logic organically, risking bold reconfiguration payoff.</comment>
