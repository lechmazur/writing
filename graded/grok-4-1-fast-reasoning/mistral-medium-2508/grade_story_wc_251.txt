<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to save the library intensifies credibly through micro-choices like slipping coordinate notes to students, rooted in his chess foresight and hearing unspoken words. Interiority shines in embodied actions like thumb-tracing the pawn and sensing the grotto's breath, revealing contradictory quiet rebellion. Students feel collective rather than distinct, but choreography holds; final child tug elicits earned smile without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from filings dancing to synchronized displays spreading like infection, culminating in Charged Poise closure: library doors sealed by humming chains, council notice posted. Orientation anchors early (cobalt library, Elias as coach by para 2). Mosaic shards (notes, displays, grotto visits) taught by 25% mark with legible transitions; cost legible in workers' aching teeth at hammer strike.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist-shrouded cobalt library and magnetic grotto constrain choices—filings align with grotto pulse to seal doors, starlight fractures into display patterns charging climax. Sensory hierarchy (ozone/parchment smell, stone breathing) filters through Elias's perceptual bias, evolving causally (veins glow blue by day 7). Recurring pawn/filings as micro-setting reweight final image of pulsing heart.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save library) signaled early via unspoken "close by spring," escalates accumulatively: notes to displays to humming chains repelling hammers, narrowing options to subtle synchronization. Agency in Elias organizing students forces trade-off (vandalism label vs. second thoughts), with felt cost in workers lowering tools. One tightening sufficient; no reversals needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet rebellion refusing forgetfulness emerges organically from particulars—origami resistance, displays as gambits, final synchronized town answering "What do you save?" Resonant non-literal close: pulsing grotto reconfigures premise, lingering ambiguity in "game far from over" without moralizing. No forced motifs; irony in council's unnoticed grotto.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice texture in poetic rhythm ("mist thickened... windows flickered... something hungry") modulates with pressure, perceptual signature biased to chess/quiet patterns. Single POV stable, no head-hopping; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Did we win?" / "game isn’t over"). Psychic distance tightens at grotto ear-press.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels: sentences multi-job (e.g., "filings... dance and align with some unseen pulse" advances plot/atmosphere). Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("bruise... bleeding light") but pattern-taught, no muddle at peak hammer strike. Varied rhythm, no loops/scaffold; zero filter stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess subtlety + magnetic grotto rebellion transforms relic trope into "forests of second thoughts" via displays/chain hum. Risk in mosaic quiet escalation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight; no template echoes, bold conceptual integrity to unseen board.</comment>
