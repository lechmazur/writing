<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation intensifies through embodied intuition and micro-choices like following wood grain over screaming/pulling her up, earning the final renunciation; Liora's otherworldly wisdom drives irony without stereotypes. Contradictory impulses act in the sinkhole reunion ("wanted to scream... but the air... understood"). Minor epiphanic polish on "sacred shake" avoids full 9+ under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density (wind/crows/prism/grain/husk/fireflies) tightens to sinkhole Charged Poise RR with cost ("didn’t ask if she was coming back... teach me the codes"; ladder holds as reconfiguration). One deepening via clues narrows to real center; orientation anchored early (farmhouse/maze); closure cost legible in logbook handoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constraints charge choices: terrace prism/grain guides to husk/beam, maze stalks "whip... whisper" pressure passage, sinkhole quilts/fireflies reconfigure stakes in final image. Sensory bias (Elias's tactile analysis) selective/POV-filtered; evolves causally (wind absent then sways). Micro-setting (jar/ladder) indispensable for closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find Liora amid sacred thresholds) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via clue-deepening that narrows options (maze → terrace → sinkhole); agency in intuition/following forces trade-off (join vs. retrieve). Cost unmistakable in descent/logbook surrender charging final poise; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (mazes/thresholds as sacred realignment, not confusion) emerges from particulars (fake vs. real center, firefly patterns); final image (fireflies brighter, story refolding) resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in Liora's lines implies complexity; earned via struggle, no platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature (intuitions as wind-traces, grain questions) biased/selective; voice modulates rhythmically with pressure (short sentences in run). Dialogue sparse/natural/subtextual ("Took you long enough"); purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm propulsive/read-aloud varied, density high (multi-job lines); but figurative overload (similes like "poorly aimed scissors"/"held sigh" in most peak sentences) dulls high-pressure sinkhole beat coherence (-0.6). No loops/scaffold; strong verbs/specific nouns propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: maze as inverted sacred geometry with pilot codes/butterfly shift transforms lost-child trope via textural mysticism; risk in lyric clues pays off at irreplaceable sinkhole poise. No templates; particulars (husk-boat, chair-leg ladder) inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
