<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's interiority shines in embodied philosophy ("failure was the point, or at least the prelude") and micro-choices like integrating the seed into puzzles, earning communal shift; Lina as secondary applies pressure via return and planting. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak beats prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup (seed→split→bloom), mosaic shards taught early ("three weeks later") with legible transitions; Charged Poise/CR closure in "Now we see what grows" reconfigures puzzle premise with business-stoppage cost legible in "Business slowed. Then it stopped."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brook as micro-setting constrains choices (replanting where "brook could sing to its roots") and charges final image ("brook’s flow steady against the silence"); selective sensory hierarchy (whispers, sighs, swell) mirrors POV priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tending unfurling growth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern break (puzzles→communal wait) narrowing options with business cost; agency in endurance/renunciation forecloses solo escape room path, legible under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of persistent unfurling emerges organically from seed motif shifting (prop→real bloom) to answer "persistence carves rock," resonant in final hand-hold without moralizing; complexity in stink as "death and miracles" embraces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (brook murmurs as receptive anchor); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Some doors don’t open until you stop knocking") advances plot; rhythmic control modulates from lyrical hush to bloom's rupture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative texture ("ink that glinted like beetle-shells") woven into action; no loops/artifacts, varied rhythm propels to closure image; minor density in metaphors during bloom beat contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms escape room trope via corpse flower into communal innovation space; risk in time-mosaic heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from seed's "alive-warm" to "what grows"; no derivative echoes.</comment>
