<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Older Elias's contradictory impulses—preserve chronicler legacy vs enable its destruction—embodied in steady hands post-burn; Younger self applies crucible pressure via raw question "Did you ever fly?", forcing earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via taught nonlinear pattern (early "time had never been linear"); Younger arrival tightens density, scroll burn as pattern-breaking CR reconfigures options with screaming cost; empty grave image seals legible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cabin confines burning choice and desk anchors scroll handling; grave constrains final check, charging empty reveal; wind/pines evolve from howl to countdown, mirroring internal chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chronicler duty vs release) signaled early via scroll revisions; Younger confrontation deepens pressure, agency in "Distill it better than I did" enables burn tightening, legible cost in ash and screams.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glyph shifts from soar to drown embody theme of failed distillation; burning reweights feral nostalgia as trap without moralizing; final "Soared" offers non-literal answer, resonating prior loops.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual bias on time fractures (e.g., "depending on which version"); jagged syntax/rhythm modulates stress, distinct dialogue idioms (accusatory youth vs corrective elder).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm/openings; metaphors (time wound, patchwork selves) cohere without muddle; no loops, burn sequence clarifies cause/effect cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Time-shard self-burn transforms chronicler trope via glyph chaos and release; soaring finale synthesizes loops inevitably, bold nonlinearity heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
