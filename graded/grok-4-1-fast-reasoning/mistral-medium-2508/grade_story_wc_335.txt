<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elspeth's combative tenderness shines in guiding Kael's doubt into action ("lies are where truths hide"), earning his successful annotation with felt relational cost; Kael's trembling hands reveal embodied anxiety without clichés. Voice distinction clear in sparse dialogue. Minor slip: nervous habit told, not constraining a pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from tea ripples to shadow lunge ("darkness coiled like a spring") to glowing annotations, delivering Charged Poise closure where shadow is bound but "next shadow to knock" makes return's cost legible. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene holds without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Library's "sagging shelves" and "geometry of the room" constrain the shadow's lunge, forcing desk annotation; playground swing hush mirrors internal tension, evolving to stillness at closure. Sensory filter (wax, cracked leather) biases through Elspeth's archivist eye. Micro-object (teacup dregs) charges final map.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—binding the shadow-door via reversible paths—tightens accumulatively when it "lunges upward," forcing Kael's annotation agency with hiss-resistance cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise, options narrowed for future ("cost of coming back"). One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Reversible truths emerge organically from tea lies to glowing "map of reversible paths," reweighting doubt as useful without moralizing; final "wait for the next shadow" answers mentoring's quiet resilience non-literally. Subtext in shadow's pushback vs. Elspeth's unflinching notes lingers ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited Elspeth ("light bends when tired"), with perceptual bias (shadows pulse like breath); dialogue subtextual ("I'll teach you how to return") advances stakes. Rhythm modulates tension—no head-hopping, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("shelves shuddering as the shadow... yanked back"); metaphors cohere (ripples "like water disturbed"). No loops or scaffolds; minor figurative density in opening doesn't touch peak binding beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shard-mirror archivist and tea-geometry exile transform library trope into fresh threshold language, with shadow-binding turn inevitable from established rules. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmick; singular vision commits fully.</comment>
