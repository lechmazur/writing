<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's embodied actions like tracing stitches and pressing tapestry to cheek reveal particular sensitivity; motivation to collect wall-stories drives micro-choices with endurance cost. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the tilt moment, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory density builds to tapestry's thrum and world tilt; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with displacement cost in "hook behind his ribs, tugging." Diary-feeding tightens toward legible before/after reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silo's metal skin groaning and ladder rungs constrain descent as metronome; recurring fireplace embers charge final walk where silo sighs. Sensory hierarchy (damp parchment, wind) filters through Elias's perceptual bias, mirroring internal resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of probing displacement signaled early escalates texturally via diary-fed glow and axis movement, narrowing to acceptance; cost legible in tilt's tug foreclosing balance. Single deepening sufficient under lens, agency in feeding fire drives turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of stories outlasting dreams emerges organically via diaries' "trade" and final "world remembered how to turn," reweighting Sundering without moralizing. Dragons motif shifts from faded to pulsing heat, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("resonance just below hearing") stable in third-person limited; rhythmic control modulates from quiet hum to tilt's urgency without slippage. Patterned diction like "bronze-quiet" taught early, legible at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with lines like "pages curled like dying insects, then glowed anew" advancing image and propulsion; no loops, varied syntax breathes with scene. Figuratives coherent and purposeful, zero artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-dream silo librarian probing dragon-pulled Sundering via artifacts transforms post-apoc trope; risk in textural accumulation heightens stakes to quiet world-repair image.</comment>
