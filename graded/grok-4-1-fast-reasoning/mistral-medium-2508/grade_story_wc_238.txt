<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's touch of the tendril despite hesitation reveals contradictory impulses and earns relational change with embodied cost ("It hurts"). Characters flawed yet specific via music/orchard lenses; voice distinct in dialogue idioms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: perfume drop initiates density surge to orchard, landing Charged Poise RR closure ("the earth remembered the current") with conceptual cost (trees fall but regrow). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perfume bottle as micro-setting constrains choice (pour drop) and charges final image (empty vial kept); archive scents/shelves tactile, mirror reconnection via roots/vines. Sensory hierarchy fits POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnection before dawn) tightens accumulatively via magic's painful drag-up and orchard surge, forcing endurance with legible cost ("Yeah. But now they’ll know they were loved first"). Agency in mutual planting forecloses isolation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final saplings offer non-literal answer to imperfect miracles, reweighting apology-as-erasure premise via orchard image without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from particulars, embracing ambiguity (both right).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in scent/music metaphors; stable close-third POV with biased noticing (sap tang over sweetness). Dialogue subtextual and idiomatic ("Words are easy. This?"), advances under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors cohere via nature/music pattern without muddle. Minor figurative density fits voice but risks overwrite in tendril surge—no loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gossip-exorcist premise freshly synthesizes rumor-curses/perfume currents, transforming apology trope via orchard grit; risk in magic mechanics heightens stakes organically.</comment>
