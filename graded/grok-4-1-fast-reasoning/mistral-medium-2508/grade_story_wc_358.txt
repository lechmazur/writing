<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when Veyra runs despite documentation compulsion, earned by patch-anchored backstory; patch loss as embodied cost forecloses explanatory self.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to flare recoil pattern break; CR closure ("the city had learned") lands with conceptual cost of adaptive threat in final log image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Labyrinth containers constrain squeezes and lean to charge ending image, mirroring recalibration; wind's pulsing thickness filters through engineer's resonance bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vortex forces flare agency, narrowing documentation path; tool shatter and limp as visible costs escalate under accumulative pressure to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final "Listen" image reweights adaptation theme non-literally, city learning as resonant answer to foresight question via patch reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "wind didn’t gust—it pulsed"; rhythm compresses in chase ("The wind screamed"), stable close-third without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density in "air pressed... holding its breath" propels without loops or muddle; varied rhythm accelerates climax cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sentient port system as adaptive foe transforms convergence trope; quiet CR risks pay off in inevitable "city had learned" hindsight.</comment>
