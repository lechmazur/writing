<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's arc from archivist to medium is earned through embodied visions and micro-choices like arranging shells, revealing contradictory impulses between preservation and release. Interiority concrete in "retroactive fever dream" and pulse hammering. Final renunciation of archiving shows visible cost without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of visions tightening to confrontation and CR closure in diary release: "Some truths weren’t meant to be archived," reweighting stakes with conceptual cost of freedom over chain. Two shards transition legibly; orientation anchored para 1. No ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lagoon constrains descent/parley and charges final image of ink dissolving, mirroring internal release. Sensory hierarchy (ozone, salt-stung) reflects archivist bias; debris evolves causally. Micro-setting (shells, locket) guides choices pivotal at climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs erasure) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via visions to parley tightening that forces trade-off. Agency in debris arrangement narrows options; cost legible in officers' retreat and diary forfeiture charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truths as current emerges organically from visions, debris ledger, and release image reweighting archiving as chain. Resonant non-literal answer in "lighter now, as if the weight... lifted"; ambiguity lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in cipher/notch noticing; diction/rhythm modulate (short sentences at "pulse hammered"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual: "You don’t want this truth... But it wants you." No head-hopping; elisions purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (e.g., climax shortens). Minor figurative density in opening but purposeful, no muddle at peak parley/ripple. Zero loops; propulsion clear to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist-retrocognition vs revisionists transforms trope via debris ciphers and lagoon release. Risk in quiet CR ending heightens conceptual stakes; inevitable in hindsight from early visions.</comment>
