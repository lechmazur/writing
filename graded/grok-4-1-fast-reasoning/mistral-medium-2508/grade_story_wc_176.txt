<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's contradictory impulses—gentle hands too busy for words—act in scene via tracing then weaving, earning her forgiveness with the cost of dissolving the card and melting regrets. Interiority embodied in chest ache and skin-seeping heat avoids stock epiphanies. Flaw of self-chiseling regrets compounds to propel reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from card-tracing to rope-weaving, cadence shift in trembling sanctum and rising chorus reconfigures preservation stake. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with card's dissolution as felt cost: "the punched card scrap dissolved in her grip." Orientation anchored early in glacier sanctum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum constrains via weeping walls and humming bones, charging final image where aurora waves and names hum beneath. Sensory hierarchy (breath crystallizing, glow older than fire) filters through caster's priorities. Recurring rope/aurora evolve causally with reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve names via forgiveness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through tremble/light/chorus deepening to realization that shifts "holding tight" to "letting change." Agency in reconfiguration forecloses regret-path with legible cost of years melting. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preservation-as-change emerges organically from card-to-rope transcription, final image of wind-answered whisper reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like frayed syllables and snowmelt ardor avoids platitudes. Counter-reading lingers in names not hers to keep.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (perforations as voice cadence, hollow wax casting) modulates rhythmically under pressure, syntax reflecting thawing mind. Stable close-third POV, no leakage. Compression taught early pays off in seamless rope image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with coherent metaphors (rope as time-strands/serpent, light as sound-made-visible) propels without muddle, rhythm varying from whispers to chorus. Zero loops; specifics like "jagged perforations" replace generics. Minor figurative density in peak unchained by pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wax-casting, organ-card memory, hair-rope weaves forgotten names into aurora-lit ice, transforming preservation trope via reconfiguration. Risky lyric fantasy heightens emotional stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from early anchors to wind-whisper.</comment>
