<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between grounded resistance and boundary-erasure drive micro-choices like synchronized breathing, earning the final transcendence; interiority concrete via tactile sextant hum and embodied exhales. Final letting-go renunciation forecloses isolation with felt integration cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sextant tracing to orchard transformation and CR closure in "He stepped through," reweighting boundaries with erasure cost legible in dissolving self. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog and frost constrain recreation method and charge final star-fruit image; orchard branches weave into constellations, mirroring internal shift through selective sensory filter. Micro-setting (sextant, mirror) tethers choices pivotal at climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recreate brother via erasure) tightens accumulatively as breathing forces fog palpability, narrowing grounded options; agency in will-pressure yields conceptual cost of self-dissolution, felt in sextant fluidizing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of boundary-erasure emerges organically from fog-skin press and mirror-boy reflection, reweighting premise in star-door CR without moralizing; final image non-literally answers grounded-vs-flight question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (fog as "second skin," frost "shattered glass") stable in third-limited POV; rhythmic modulation accelerates in breathing beat, compression taught early and legible at star-welcome closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from orchard kneel to star-step; figurative coherence (melting frost, fluid brass) serves texture without muddle, though peak density risks minor overload pre-dissolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirror-craft and astral loss transforms magic-realist tropes via breathing-method erasure; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at window-door pivot.</comment>
