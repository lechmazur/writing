<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong micro-choices reveal Elias's thoughtful hierarchy of values, as in offering the drawer pull to evoke personal connection over direct info trade. Kaelis's hesitation embodies ruthless undercut by familial impulse, forcing the deal. Minor slip in abstract emotional summaries like "ghost of a sibling’s love" slightly dilutes embodied contradiction at peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: drawer pull offer → Kaelis recognition → deal shake as DC with cost (info traded, war limps on). Orientation anchored early in parapet/chasm. Closure image of boy taking hand reconfigures stakes legibly under causal drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist and chasm constrain hesitation and part dramatically ("mist parted, revealing the chasm’s depth"), charging final step from edge. Sensory hierarchy (slick boots, howling wind) reflects Elias's negotiator urgency. Recurring mist mirrors internal "furrowed hush," evolving with deal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free boy) tightens causally via Kaelis's "They won’t release," narrowing to drawer pull trade-off. Agency in Elias's lie-as-lever forces her stance crystallization. Visible cost in surrendered symbol and ongoing war charges final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drawer pull reprises as resonant answer to neutral territory theme, shifting from "lever" lie to "father’s lesson" in final pocket. Emerges organically from negotiation particulars without moralizing. Boy's "Will they forgive me?" invites ambiguity on recycling wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in lyrical filters like "mist that curled like ghostly fingers." Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("A lever," he lied), distinguishing voices. Rhythm modulates tension without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density in lines like "its tarnished sheen catching the moonlight like a silent oath" propels without loops. Minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but patterns consistently to payoff. Varied syntax supports causal propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drawer pull transforms negotiation trope into personal wisdom anchor, fresh synthesis of symbol and tactic. Risk in poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitable hindsight from father's lesson to boy's hand.</comment>
