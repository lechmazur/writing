<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied actions like thumb-polishing sea glass under grief's pressure; contradictory endurance vs. loss impulses act in scene, earning handover choice with lineage cost. Girl's arrival tests Liora's keeper role without headcount blur.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mist/memories build density to child's arrival (causal cue via footsteps), Charged Poise closure in glass-passing reconfigures solitary keeping with conceptual cost legible in final villager image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto's mist/veins constrain perception and charge final embrace; selective sensory filter (quartz winking, kelp braids) mirrors Liora's light priorities, evolving with mist retreat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (share enduring light) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via Elias/grandmother memories to girl's plea, crystallizing renunciation of solitude; cost felt in handover amid village fire contrast.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of stillness-over-fire emerges organically via polishing motif shift to lineage image; final stones pulsing reweights fire/shout dialect non-literally, embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with perceptual signature (lingering lights); voice rhythm modulates from hush to hum, dialogue subtext-driven (girl's "keep it" plea advances handover).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short prayers amid mist curls); purposeful figurative layering (serpent mist) propels without muddle or loops, closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mentor-passage via non-fire "pearl of stillness" and sea glass pulse; risks lyric texture heighten stakes without gimmick, transforming fire trope.</comment>
