<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory pride and persistence act in micro-choices like digging despite doubt and swallowing pride to ask the question; final apple bite earns shift with relational cost, embodied in trembling fingers and aching chest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as textural density (images of roots, ribbon, seed) tightens to Charged Poise closure; sprout twisting upward before words fade delivers on-page reconfiguration with conceptual cost of unread cracks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard-cathedral setting constrains planting (light bends through rose window) and charges final image (ribbon, sprout, doll under boughs); sensory details like apple forgiveness smell filter through mender's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bridging wisdom signaled early tightens via seed/note forcing question; under Accumulative lens, wind chorus and apple bite crystallize stance with felt cost of duty-to-choice shift, narrowing relational options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of vows as deciduous emerges organically from seed planting and sprout/chorus answer reweighting generational wisdom; final doll cradling sprout offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in nature-contract metaphors; rhythmic control modulates from humming orchard to sharp laugh, teaching patterned elision paid off in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image-stacked sentences; minor figurative density in opening (veins stitching) serves accumulative texture without muddle, though slight overwriting nudges from 9-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mender's craft, orchard-cathedral hybrid, and deciduous vows transforms vow/fruit tropes; risk in lyric closure heightens stakes via conceptual repricing of persistence.</comment>
