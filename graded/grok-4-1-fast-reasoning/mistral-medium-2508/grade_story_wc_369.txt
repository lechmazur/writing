<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority peaks in "tears on his cheeks—not from sadness, but from the sheer pressure," embodying contradictory emotion without labels; earned endurance of his keeper role forecloses ignoring relics, shown via deconstruction micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as textural density builds to CR closure in "hands... already felt lighter," reweighting sorrow's passage with conceptual cost (trees heavier); orientation anchored early in tower/labyrinth, no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Moonlight as micro-setting constrains deconstruction ("laid out the pieces... moonlight pooled") and charges final image ("moonlight bled... like a balm"); oaks ring tower, mirroring absorption theme tactilely without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping sorrow/dreams) deepens texturally via sextant pulse to tree realization, narrowing to endurance choice; cost legible in "pressure of it" and lighter hands, but escalation subtle without sharp trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of absorbed sorrow emerges via particulars like "sorrow, quantified" and tree rings, resonating in final non-literal image "oaks... branches heavy with stars" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature ("labyrinth... breathed," "stones groaning"); rhythmic control modulates from dense deconstruction to charged poise in ending hush, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figures ("brass arms bent like a dying spider") taught early, propels via varied rhythm; minor repetition ("sighed") pattern-motivated, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sextant grief and tree absorption transforms relic-hunting trope; risk in breathing labyrinth pays off inevitably at "trees always did," heightening stakes organically.</comment>
