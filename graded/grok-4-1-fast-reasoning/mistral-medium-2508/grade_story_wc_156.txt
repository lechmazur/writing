<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Liora's cling to certainty versus painting the door, embodied in pulse stutters and gasping; final acceptance earned via layered awakenings with visible cost of never returning. Interiority particular to restorer's preservation-creation tension. Secondary figures apply pressure without diluting POV.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of nested murals/awakenings breaks pattern when she paints door, delivering CR closure ("stepped through... ready to accept") with conceptual cost legible in "exchange what you know." Mosaic shards taught early via first ripple, transitions crisp; orientation anchored by para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden and nickel constrain choices (press coin to sculpture triggers ripple; hums approval at door stroke) and charge final image (nickel winks embedded). Sensory hierarchy sound/tactile via POV bias sharpens surreal pressure. No white-room; evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs. curiosity) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through nested layers narrowing to stance crystallization; agency in painting door forecloses return with on-page cost ("never returned"). Escalation coherent under lens, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity filling pause emerges organically via nickel/painting arc; final image ("laughter tangled in sound waves") reweights cycle from trap to invitation without moral. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; counter-reading (trap?) lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (teasing secrets from plaster) modulates rhythm under stress; stable single POV, no leakage. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You're late... Again?"). Patterned elision (awakenings) taught, legible at Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm/syntax; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors ("sound coiled... bewitching"). Figuratives purposeful (rippled... *her*), integrated without overwriting in peak (door stroke). Ear-test flows seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms portal trope via textural sound-nickel-mural synthesis, inevitable in hindsight; bold mosaic risk heightens surreal stakes (+0.4). Fresh inflections in cycle repricing freshen emotional truth of exchange.</comment>
