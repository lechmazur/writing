<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority embodied in cracked fingers and steady wrists under cold pressure; patience as contradictory endurance vs. world's endings earned through layered actions culminating in realization. Final choice to continue work forecloses easy rest with felt bodily cost. No unearned epiphanies; voice coherent and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layers build density to seal's RR (Charged Poise in "teaching it how to stay"), reconfiguring preservation with conceptual cost of endless patience legible in final fold and snow. Orientation anchored early in crater/orchard; no shards, single scene tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frostbitten soil and skeletal trees constrain hands and breath, charging closure image of glowing embers under drifts; sensory hierarchy (cold cracking skin, silence holding breath) mirrors internal stakes. Micro-setting (apple husks, ice shards) enables patterns purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seal starlight) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via layering density to seal's tightening; agency in pricking thumb and whispering binds with cost of veins/air/orchard drained. Endurance forecloses world's endings but prices ongoing work visibly in frost-melted lashes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patience teaching light to stay emerges organically from particulars (patterns from husks/seeds); final image of snow on shoulders reweights premise without moral, inviting ambiguity of unfinished story. Resonance from heartbeats-to-maps, no tidy platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (breath curling like smoke, gold leaf stubborn as hope) stable in close third; rhythm modulates from steady layering to pulsing map's cadence under pressure. Purposeful compression taught early, legible at seal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (each line layers image/action); varied rhythm passes read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds—"the paper drank the starlight" multisensory pivot. Figuratives coherent (flash-paper as dragonfly wings), no muddle in peak seal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical lyricism transforms post-apocalyptic endurance trope via patterns-from-discard; risk in "spaces between breaths" heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in map's pulse. Bold, non-obvious premise fully committed.</comment>
