<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—Liora's reluctance ("didn’t want to believe it") clashes with twitching fingers and snapping at the moon—earning her final metamorphosis as bridge with brother's warning as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensory density of spices and visions builds to CR closure in final image of glowing spices and beasts recognizing her grief-beauty, with legible cost in crumbling fortune and cold burn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard's eternal moonlight and humming soil constrain conjures (earth groans, roots cradle bones), charging final gathering of beasts; recurrent spices as micro-setting evolve tactilely with her skin-searing actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforge brother) escalates via agency-driven density under accumulative lens: vanilla crush fails with vision-dissolve, nutmeg pull yields flickering wrongness and burning touch, forcing her reconfiguration with undeniable relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of self-metamorphosis emerges organically from spice rituals and fortune's "You will become what you seek," resonant in final bridge-image reweighting grief as beautiful without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (spice scents as emotion proxies) stable in single POV; brother's echo-dialogue carries subtext of warning, modulating rhythmically to charged poise at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful spice-metaphor pattern avoids muddle; rhythm varies (short punches in conjures like "The air shimmered"), but minor figurative density in opening slightly risks overwrite without closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spice-conjuring in eternal-moon orchard transforms grief-trope into cosmic self-bridge; risk of lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from phoenix-veil setup.</comment>
