<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (arsonist blood vs. compassion fire) act in coin-stitching and wound-binding; final run to smoke earns renunciation of destructive path with village-watch cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density from setup to boy's cry (inciting beat) tightens stake; closure Charged Poise in "coin a steady pulse" reconfigures identity with felt tremble/cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon/black sand constrain gathering/stitching and enable wound aid; recurring sand "jagged...fire" charges final image of remaking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Boy's wound deepens dominant stake (prove scars sing) via agency in red-thread bind; village doubt as persistent cost legible in "trembled just slightly."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fire-as-warm reweights consume-premise through coin/boy-blood thread; resonant non-literal answer in "carried both flames," no moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fire/ember perceptual signature ("rough and crackling like dry kindling") biases noticing; dialogue subtext ("All the best stories do") goal-driven, rhythm pulses to alarm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density in "scars could sing if given the right voice" propels motif without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Scars that sang" synthesizes firefighter/arsonist tropes into inevitable graft motif; risks lyric reflection heighten stakes without opacity.</comment>
