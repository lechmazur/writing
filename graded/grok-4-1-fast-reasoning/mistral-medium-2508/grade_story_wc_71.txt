<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via concrete noticing of shifts like streetlights' cello hum, embodied in pulse jump and hands' ritual memory; final internalization earned through prior sensory accumulation. Minor deduction for subtle rather than overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously at voice moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from creeping shifts to CR closure in final exhale and softer steps; orientation anchored in first line (bay, dock); cost legible in leaving shard, reconfiguring chase to carrying hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orris shard and displaced objects (teacup, key) constrain ritual choice and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (scent, hum, damp wood) reflects Liora's bias toward subtle pulses. Environment guides action via tide's gifts and breeze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding alive houses) signaled early, tightens via voice brush and teacup stilling under textural lens; agency in spiral arrangement forecloses external chase with felt internal cost. Enters 8+ as tightening narrows options to witness/leave.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reverent silence emerges organically from particulars like dock creak joining quiet; final image ("steps fell softer... first sip of water") offers resonant CR reweighting hush as carried internalization, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature (creeping strangeness in familiar); rhythmic modulation peaks in closure lines like "bay behind her sighed," heightening pressure without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers brushed... worn smooth" advances object and backstory); coherent metaphors (cup holds light) purposeful; minor template cadence in hush descriptors limits from 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of orris shard as hush key transforms house-life trope via textural ritual; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable CR, no derivative echoes.</comment>
