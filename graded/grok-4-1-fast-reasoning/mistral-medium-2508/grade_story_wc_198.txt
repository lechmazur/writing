<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the saxophonist's precision playing to "unmake sound" amid grotto resistance, earning his final endurance of the internalized prophecy with the note's discovery as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from mist's coil to prophecy's internalization via paper slip, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure where the hum "between his ribs" reconfigures options with inescapable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mist and prism atrium constrain choices—pressing skin, emerging face—while dewdrops bursting charge the climax, evolving to recharge the final image of mist at ankles and glowing atrium.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to hush prophecy tightens accumulatively through resistance (whisper, rainbows, face), protagonist's agency in "descent so quiet" foreclosing silence with internalization cost legible in the note and return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unfillable hunger emerges organically from musical silences and prophecy's persistence, final image of playing on offering non-literal resonant answer that reweights endless cycle without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with musical perceptual signature ("negative space between vibrations") modulates rhythmically under pressure, stable close third-person POV with no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied syntax mirroring held notes; purposeful metaphors consistent without muddle, even in peak ("mist coiled tighter, pressing against his eyelids"). Minor figurative density fits taught pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musician-as-prophet silencing via negative space transforms mystical trope, risk-taking in cyclical lyric structure heightens inevitable return without gimmickry.</comment>
