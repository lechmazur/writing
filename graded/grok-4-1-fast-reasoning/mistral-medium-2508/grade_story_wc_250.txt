<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Guardian's micro-choices (mirror tilts, shutter weaves) reveal hierarchy of values under boy's shame; boy's embodied tension (trembling hands, hitched breath) and earned release (kneeling, lighter pockets) satisfy contradictory impulses and 9+ test. No unearned epiphanies; flaws (boy's theft shame) complicate without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds from mirror sliver to star-spill Charged Poise RR with cost in boy's foreclosed shame. Orientation anchored in first paragraph ("cobalt dock," guardian at water’s edge); closure boy's steadier steps and guardian's stilled shutters reconfigure options legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dock's slick planks and canal fog constrain reflections and patterns, charging final star image; recurring water/mirror evolve causally with weaves. Sensory hierarchy (light on water over broad visuals) mirrors guardian's priorities; 9+ test passed as shutters constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Boy's shame stake signaled early, tightens accumulatively via complex patterns narrowing to star embrace, forcing kneel/acceptance with felt cost (crumpled note discarded). Protagonist agency in weaves drives; visible trade-off charges poise without resolving off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of wordless empathy emerges via light/dark particulars, final mirror on father's sill recharges as non-literal CR answer to shame's silence. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in canal's hold, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (shadows as "forgotten promises," stars "unconcerned") biases via guardian; stable third-limited with no leakage. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (boy's mutters evade direct plea); rhythm modulates from tension to release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "mirror flashed once, twice—then held steady" advances action/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts. Purposeful figurative weave ("net of light") coheres without muddle in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dental mirror/shutter patterns transforms silent listener trope into tactile empathy; risk in neologism "spiralingly calm" heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable final reprise (mirror on workbench) feels inevitable.</comment>
