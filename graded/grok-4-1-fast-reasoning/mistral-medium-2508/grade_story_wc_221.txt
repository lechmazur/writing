<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in doubting true north as "a lie they told themselves" yet tracing compass and sketching anomaly compel the leap; final renunciation of pariah status earned via embodied pull. Interiority particular through frost-bitten touch and hand moving "on its own."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from thinned air to thickening anomaly, culminating in CR closure where "*Home* wasn’t a place. It was a direction" reconfigures legacy with cost of abandoning station. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; compass needle snap pays off disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Compass applique as recurring micro-setting constrains alignment choice and charges final image of it "gleaming faintly, its needle still pointing"; deck's glass and railing tactilely guide leap amid evolving groans and frost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of legacy doubt tightens accumulatively via glimpse to unfolding light forcing exploration choice; agency in aligning sketch forecloses stasis, with cost in weightless push-off unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of direction over place emerges organically from sketch alignments; final compass reprise and "*stars... didn’t lie*" non-literally reweight custom as key without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in warped stars and "silence so deep it echoed... absence" modulates rhythmically to short climax sentences; stable close-third with no leakage under anomaly pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with lines like "light expanded, not in space, but in time, unfolding like a bloom in reverse" propelling via varied rhythm; zero loops or artifacts, metaphors coherent and taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesis of pariah legacy and temporal anomaly into compass-key realization feels inevitable; risk in lyric CR leap heightens conceptual stakes via "bloom in reverse" inflection.</comment>
