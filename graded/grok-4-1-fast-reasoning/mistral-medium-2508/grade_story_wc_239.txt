<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to unravel illusions drives consistent micro-choices like whispering definitions and tearing the dictionary, revealing character through embodied actions under arbitration pressure; interiority concrete in palm-to-page bleeding ink. Final renunciation of witness role feels earned with visible cost of losing the anchor. Minor abstraction in "he understood then" borders unearned epiphany but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of shifting words, pulsing temple, and fractal shelves builds to cadence shift at tearing dictionary (DC/RR), reconfiguring illusion with legible cost in temple's collapse and dictionary's vanishing; orientation anchored early in temple library as last witness. Single-shard scope fits defaults; no lens ambiguity. Patterned elision of time pays off in CR of reborn world.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dictionary as recurring micro-setting constrains choices (anchor rewritten mid-use) and charges final image (warm cover gone under tree); bone shelves, skin books, blood ink evolve tactilely through action, mirroring internal unraveling. Sensory hierarchy (scent of parchment/god-breath) narrows with crisis; fractal corridors subtly guide inward/outward path. Environment shapes climax tactics without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel illusions vs. spiral arbitration) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via voice's question and blank "witness" definition narrowing to tearing act with agency; cost felt in temple's shuddering death and freedom's weight lifted. One meaningful deepening suffices; no coincidence resolves. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise at threshold crossing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of slippery truths vs. imposed unity emerges organically from shifting definitions and torn book, reweighted in final fruit-of-memory bite without moralizing; resonant CR in dictionary's absence answers "beginning or end?" via reborn world's breath. Subtext in voice's resignation and blank pages invites ambiguity on history's cost. Particulars like juice on chin ground emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in poetic bias toward living language (rippling pages, breathing temple); voice texture modulates rhythmically from hush to resounding in climax. Ethereal voice lines carry subtext as arbitration pressure without naturalism issues. Purposeful compression legible under textural lens; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pages fluttering like wounded birds" advances atmosphere/action); rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion syncs to escalation. Figurative density purposeful and pattern-taught (language alive), no muddle in peak tearing beat; minor paraphrase in temple descriptions (-0.2) but no loops or scaffold touching closure. Clean mechanics, strong verbs dominate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic librarian-witness tearing history's book transforms end-of-world trope via dictionary's evolution from anchor to vanished light; risk in nonlinear fractal setting heightens stakes organically. Final walking-forward reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars, no derivative echoes. Bold poetic conceit commits fully without retreat.</comment>
