<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's precognitively forgetful trait drives contradictory impulses, shown in trembling hands and running toward the sculpture despite fear; final renunciation of arrows feels earned via prior clinging. Interiority particular, embodied in tasting static and chalk pulsing like heartbeat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns (chalk spiral, driftwood arrow, tape) tightens to RR closure in snapping arrows and leaving chalk, with conceptual cost of foreclosed search legible in "didn’t need to locate anymore." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fog and sculptures constrain choices (fog parts for arrow alignment, dancer unfolds at center) and charge final shore image; seawater-filled eyes and rusted joints tactile, POV-filtered via salt whispers. Sensory hierarchy urgent, narrowing to creak and metal taste.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locating the older thing via patterns) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via tape hum, sculpture movement, voice rebuke; agency in pressing tape and snapping arrows forecloses path with felt cost of crumbled chalk and silent tape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Clinging to echoes emerges via tape's return and voice's "never learned how to let them go," resolved non-literally in waves as "sound of growing older," reweighting search without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (fog as breath on glass, air tasting static); rhythmic compression under stress ("He ran. Not away. Toward.") heightens without head-hopping; lyric elision taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm (short creak sentence pierces fog); metaphors consistent (static, rewinding tape) without muddle or loops, even in peak sculpture beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prophet arranging driftwood arrows toward precognitive echoes transforms junkyard trope; risky lyric accumulation risks obscurity but heightens closure via tape-sculpture machine payoff.</comment>
