<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poet's motivation to alchemize pain is embodied in concrete micro-choices like pressing the postcard and blooming the ghost's ribs, earning the final manual-writing with centuries' cost; shy-unstoppable trait shows in persistent singing amid new war.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density tightening from ghost accusation to louder singing and shell-sealing RR (Charged Poise), cost legible in "shell sealed itself around her like a cocoon"; orientation anchored early in shell/sea.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shell's "calcium veins" and acoustics constrain singing/propagation of lullabies, charging final vibration; sensory details like "off-key wind" and jellyfish filtered through poet's priorities mirror internal alchemy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform war-pain) escalates accumulatively via ghost interaction deepening to manual amid new war's "dull throb"; agency in singing louder forecloses inaction with felt cost of isolation in sealing shell.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow's alchemy emerges via shifting images (weapons to petals, gunpowder to pollen), final "Alchemy of Staying" reweights premise without statement; resonance from particulars like eaten manual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (e.g., "ribs bloomed with starlight") stable in single POV; ghost dialogue subtextual ("sing through you") advances pressure; rhythm modulates from whisper to hum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative density in ghost beat (e.g., "unfurling galaxy") borders overwriting without muddle; no loops, propulsion clear to shell's exhale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic poet-shell alchemizing wars via song/manual transforms tropes; risk in eating paper and wind-titling heightens stakes organically.</comment>
