<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (grief vs. insistent question) act in scene through embodied actions like tracing scars and drawing; final renunciation of the box is earned by fire backstory cued concretely, with visible relational cost in lighter steps forward.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density builds to Charged Poise closure; leaving the box on the stone with sap and moonlight reconfigures pain's weight with legible emotional cost, one tightening via the phone call cue suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ridge path as spine between scarred/unscarred valleys constrains choices (sitting on fire-skip stone to draw) and charges final image (box filled with sap/moonlight); sensory details like warm bark and fogged porcelain filter through firefighter's tactile bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate pain without cutting) signaled early via question, deepens accumulatively through box-opening and drawing beats driven by agency; cost unmistakable in leaving relic and emoji flame to daughter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of pain's alchemy emerges organically from particulars like phoenix drawing and box veins; final valley walk offers non-literal resonant answer to central question, reweighting fire's consumption into renewal without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in fire-scar textures and ash-quiet metaphors; rhythmic control modulates from jagged question to tender drawing syntax, heightening reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; varied rhythm propels from gust-shaken pines to dawn-blurred sky, purposeful figures like "veins pulsing" enhance without muddling peak realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of firefighter scars mirroring tree/box cracks transforms grief tropes into alchemical drawing act; risk of lyric reflection pays off in phoenix-child image, feeling inevitable hindsight.</comment>
