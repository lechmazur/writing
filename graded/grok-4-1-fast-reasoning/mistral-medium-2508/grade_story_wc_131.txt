<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's caching habit clashes with archive rules in embodied hesitation ("reckless"); final step into light and key handoff earn visibility choice with isolation cost, revealing values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via outage density to laugh recognition tightening; Charged Poise closure in key exchange reconfigures unseen life with rule-breaking cost legible in dawn image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crawl spaces, vents, and grates constrain tape/photo delivery tactics; stained-glass dawn light charges final visibility image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Isolation stake signaled early tightens via her laugh recognition, narrowing to revelation agency; photo drop and emergence foreclose hiding with relational cost charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sense memory of laugh reweights caching isolation; key handoff provides resonant, non-literal answer to unseen preservation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with tactile/sound-biased signature ("laugh spilling... clear as a bell"); sparse dialogue natural, subtext-driven ("You were there").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density in image-action fusion ("tape spun... fragments—high, then broken"); rhythm peaks propulsively at laugh reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Caching ephemera for the lost transforms unseen observer premise originally; quiet emergence and key handoff risk poise heightening stakes inevitably.</comment>
