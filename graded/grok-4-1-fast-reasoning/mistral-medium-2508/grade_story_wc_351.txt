<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in "calculated yet trembling" hands act simultaneously under pressure; final cartographer identity earned via escalating visions and micro-choices with embodied cost (knees hit ground). Interiority concrete and helix-specific, avoiding epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of visions tightens from personal memory to stranger's face/probe signal, culminating in CR closure where "unfold" reconfigures identity with conceptual cost of embraced fractures (final mirror grasp). Orientation anchored early; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mirror as micro-setting constrains choices (adjustments, current pulse) and charges final image (warm edges, walk into canyon). Canyon "wound" mirrors internal entanglement; sensory ozone/rust evolves with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unfold entanglements) signaled early, escalates via agency-driven adjustments yielding deepening visions ("stranger’s" face spikes pulse); under accumulative lens, density reweights knowledge/options with felt embodiment (ripples, knees buckle). Cost legible in fractured embrace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory-entanglement emerges organically via mirror layers and helix mind; final image ("cartographer of the entangled dark") offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting precision/chaos without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in scientific lyricism ("synaptic plasticity rippled," "quantum foam"); rhythmic control modulates intensity (short visceral pulses amid fluid clauses), stable third-limited POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line layers image/pressure (e.g., "moon’s silver scalpel"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (canyon "ribs/wound") even in peak visions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neural nanites, quantum memory, fractured mirror transforms sci-fi tropes into lyric entanglement; bold poetic risks heighten stakes, inevitable in hindsight via helix motif.</comment>
