<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Revelation of brother's handwriting ("It was her brother’s") compels shift from art loss to familial betrayal, embodied in "ash in her lungs"; adaptive trait earns final renunciation of ledger, foreclosing search with cost of unmaking identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as frost-ledger parallels build density to Charged Poise closure: "She let the strip fall... lighter than she’d been in years," reconfiguring purpose with undeniable cost of foreclosed answers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frost patterns as micro-setting constrain realization ("searching for patterns... the way she once sought them in light"), mirroring internal fractures and charging final exhale/step into "quiet light."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ledger entry "12th day, double load, pay in silver or the girl" tightens stake from survival to betrayal under textural lens, forcing agency in dropping it with legible cost of renounced pursuit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recurring breaks (glass, frost, ledger) emerge theme of truth in pauses, answered non-literally by "She stepped into the light... arriving," reweighting making to unmaking without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice's perceptual signature (light trapped, fractures, pauses) taught early via "delicate as breath" holds stably, rhythmic modulation to short sentences ("One step. Then another.") heightens closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Purposeful "frost"/"pauses" recurrence avoids loops, propels density (e.g., "patterns sharp and fleeting"); varied rhythm peaks in "The canyon... exhaled," with zero artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scorched ledger and frost as "language of absence" transforms loss trope into purpose-via-unmaking, with ledger drop as inevitable, risk-heightening cadence shift.</comment>
