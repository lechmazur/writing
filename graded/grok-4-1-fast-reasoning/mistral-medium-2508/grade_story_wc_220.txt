<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rook's embodied age (joints creaking, nose twitching) and contradictory pull (settlement rules vs. riddle's instinct) compel the final entry into the dome with clear cost; interiority particular via hound senses and memory fragment anchored to the leaf.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density (cylinder to leaf to vines) tightening to CR closure where dome seals with conceptual cost ("he called it home"); oriented early at scrapyard edge, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Wasteland specifics (wind-carved dust, bent rocks, fissure) constrain path and charge final dome image; sensory hierarchy via Rook's nose/scent privileges damp earth amid rust, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnect via riddle) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to vines' pull narrowing options; agency in pressing leaf forces entry trade-off with legible life-cost in sealing dome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of distance-as-bridge emerges via particulars (voice grooves, melting wax, roots whispering); final image reweights premise non-literally as "first garden war," lingering without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with hound-perceptual bias (scent over sight); rhythmic lyricism modulates pressure, consistent diction/texture supports accumulative drive without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (e.g., "leaf burned... veins bleeding into cracks"); purposeful metaphor pattern taught early avoids muddle, minor figurative density in peak dome beat doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hound mythos with phonograph riddles transforms post-apoc tropes; risk in lyric anthropomorphism heightens closure stakes via vines' pull without gimmickry.</comment>
