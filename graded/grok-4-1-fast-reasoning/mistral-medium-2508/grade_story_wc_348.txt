<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to atone via bridges shifts convincingly to dissolution through embodied grief (scar recall, breath hitch), with micro-choices like placing the chrysalis earning the final wade; contradictory impulses emerge in calculating vs. flowing mind, though girl's arrival feels lightly secondary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early anchoring (ravine edge by para 2) and closure via Conceptual Repricing in "the last of the grief loosening," reweighting grief with legible emotional cost; single scene coheres without shards or disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Braided ravine and foam constrain insight and charge final convergence image, with sensory details (cold biting boots, light on chrysalis) filtered through Elias's polymer lens; micro-setting as ravine paths mirrors internal shift purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (grief as separation) signaled early tightens accumulatively via foam insight and girl's "map," forcing renunciation of atonement with on-page cost in grief's loosening; agency in chrysalis placement narrows options effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of dissolution over connection emerges organically from river/polymer images, culminating in resonant non-literal answer—"pieces fall into place"—reweighting prior grief without moralizing; subtext in foam spiral and paths invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (symphonic patterns in foam, erosion); brief dialogue natural/subtextual, girl's pitch echoing sister's voice distinct; rhythmic modulation fits emotional release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (foam as Fibonacci sheet music) coherent across beats, no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies for propulsion, though figurative density borders overwrought pre-insight but serves taught lyric pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer grief and river dissolution transforms tropes, with foam-tracing insight inevitable from setup; risk in lyric metaphors heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
