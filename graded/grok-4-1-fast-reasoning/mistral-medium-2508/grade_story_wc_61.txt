<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between sentimental attachment and cycle-breaking drive the memory sacrifice; embodied thrum in bones and hitched breath earn the closure choice with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as gear pings accumulate into path solidification; memory forfeiture as conceptual cost delivers Charged Poise CR at "She stepped forward," with constraint shaping final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nebula garden's resonating petals constrain ping-path revelation and mirror internal cycles in the final "exhaled one final petal," charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to share light tightens via gear's demand for memory, narrowing to renunciation that forecloses old cycles; cost unmistakable in "let the gear take the memory."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed light emerges implicitly via resonance vs. fire; final non-look-back and gear stilling reweight cycles non-literally without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature of frequencies and hums sustains single POV; rhythmic modulation peaks in closure without elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels from opening sigh to "pattern broke"; zero loops, purposeful figures like "petals trembled" avoid muddle in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Resonance-over-fire synthesis and memory-transit risk transform cycle tropes; inevitable in hindsight via gear's infinite approximation fulfilled at stilling.</comment>
