<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Archivist's motivation to reframe pain roots clearly in traits and intensifies via micro-choices like tucking lavender sprig, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for 9+ depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to Charged Poise RR at shutter click—"healing wasn’t subtraction, but rearrangement"—with legible conceptual cost as case lightens without removal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ruins, lavender, and shadow constrain shot timing and charge final image, with vines "weaving like stitches" mirroring internal reframing through POV-filtered senses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transmuting grief tightens via light shift and girl/butterfly alignment under Accumulative lens, narrowing to agency in final framing with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of pain rearrangement emerges implicitly from photo arcs to constellation, offering resonant non-literal answer in final image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature on reaching hands/light and lyrical rhythm modulating to calm closure creates controlled, biased texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety and density propel effectively, but sustained figurative layering ("arcs," "stitches," "veins") borders overwriting without variant payoff in peak image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Archivist's photo-alchemy premise synthesizes grief tropes into fresh, inevitable constellation image, with lyric risk heightening stakes organically.</comment>
