<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Painter's methodically hopeful persistence shines in steady hands despite 43 sleepless nights and dying tree, with contradictory impulses in pausing at "to rouse/forgive" glyph resolved by writing child's laughter, earning sleep as visible cost/renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds from painting lost languages to jasmine scent return, new leaf, and sleep as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with costs (leaf gone, brush worn); orientation anchored in first paragraph, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse and fig leaves constrain choices (painting on veins), charge closure (unfurling leaf gone, air smells of rain); sensory bias (green air, jasmine) mirrors internal hope, evolving with smog thinning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kindness/memory via languages) signaled early, tightens accumulatively with child's laughter forcing micro-turn to write it, yielding tree's response and sleep; agency in brush strokes forecloses insomnia with legible costs (43 nights broken, worn brush).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of remembered kindness emerges from brush gift, lost languages absorbed, new leaf; final "dawn" writing non-literally answers without moralizing, reweighting premise via fig shudder and strangers waking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (glyphs as "curved thorns," scents evoking memory) with rhythmic modulation under insomnia pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at moon-watched closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "moonlight catching the silvered tip" does image/foreshadowing/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, propulsion peaks in "The fig tree shuddered" to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh magical realist synthesis of insomnia, lost languages on living leaves, kindness as linguistic resurrection; risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off inevitably at worn brush/dawn.</comment>
