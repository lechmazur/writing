<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pivotal shift from control to surrender earned through embodied observations like hands shaking under microscope, culminating in pulling stakes and pulse-sync without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from leaf textures to cellular reconstruction, tightening to RR/Charged Poise in handing leaf to customer with legible cost of abandoned control.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Linden tree and leaf constrain realization and action, as in "leaf cupped in the hollow of a garden statue’s hand," with sensory details like mud-blurred skin evolving purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of control vs. surrender deepens via microscope revelation narrowing options, with agency in stake-pulling foreclosing tidy nursery and charging dawn lattice image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of storm-as-invitation reweights "why this tree?" through tree-mirroring surrender, resonant in final arms-wide rain embrace without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Botanist-perceptual signature in phrases like "silent rebellions" and "cells rearrange" sustains lyrical rhythm, modulating seamlessly to raw laugh under storm pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative, dense lines like "shedding rigid walls for something fluid" vary rhythm with zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors propelling to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical metamorphosis driving personal release transforms epiphany trope, inevitable in cellular shift paralleling nursery redesign.</comment>
