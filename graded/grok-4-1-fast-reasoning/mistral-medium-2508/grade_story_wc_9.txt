<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via reaching through mist despite knowing better, earning final renunciation; interiority concrete (breath hitched, throat tightened) with embodied grief; brother's pressure forces micro-choice to repent, foreclosing hoarded loss with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ink-tracing accumulates density to brother's appearance (DC setup), ledger reveal deepens, saucer shatter enables CR closure ("she let go") with conceptual cost of released time; single scene oriented early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Spongy moss sinks boots, glade as reservoir constrains ritual and pools time, charging acorn final image; sensory hierarchy (damp earth, child laughter curls ankles) mirrors internal fracture; recurring saucer/ink integrates via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lost time via brother's fracture) signaled early, tightens via ledger ("each crack a year") narrowing to repentance trade-off; agency in tracing/letting go forecloses path, cost legible in shattered saucer and warm hands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of accumulated time/grief emerges via particulars (ink roots, ledger thefts), final acorn reconfigures as "beginning" without moralizing; subtext in mist-pass-through tests devotion's cost, resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("constellations only she could read," biased to fractures) stable in third-limited; rhythmic modulation peaks at "glade exhaled"; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("repent" telepathic, goal-pursuing).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but figurative density (moonlight bled, ink as starless sky) borders overwrite in opening without mid-beat pattern break (-0.3); no loops, varied rhythm supports ear test, closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy/time-reservoir transforms loss tropes via ink-ledger specificity; risky lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at "time waits" to acorn payoff; no derivative echoes.</comment>
