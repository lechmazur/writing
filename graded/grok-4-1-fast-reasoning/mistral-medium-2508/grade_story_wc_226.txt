<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Defiant artist's motivation intensifies through embodied resolve, culminating in bleeding-fingers carving that forecloses silence with personal cost; contradictory impulses evident in past mischief versus present risk. Interiority particular and concrete, avoiding epiphanies. Past reflection anchors present climb without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as echo density builds to CR closure: spire shatters via her words, reweighting forgiveness with canyon's memory and her lighter heart; cost legible in "fingers bleeding" and settling dust. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene tightens seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Bone towers and echoes constrain climb and amplify words, charging final "bone-dust settling" image; sensory hierarchy (vibration in palm, teeth on edge) reflects urgency. Mist and spire evolve causally, mirroring internal fracture without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose spire's lie) signaled early, escalates via ritual thrum forcing sideways climb and carving amid swelling chant; agency in micro-choices narrows options, cost in unstable light and screams unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Price of forgiveness emerges organically via refraction motif shifting from dissolution to confrontation; final carving into remains offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting premise without moralizing. Complexity lingers in unresolved screams swallowed by mist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in sigil-tracing and bone-vibrations; rhythmic diction modulates from hushed mist to cacophony, heightening pressure. No head-hopping or withholding; voice biased toward defiant poetry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (e.g., "shards so fine no one could grasp") propels without loops; varied rhythm breathes with scene urgency, climax vivid in "words spilling out in a rush." Minor figurative density in opening but pattern-taught and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bone-grown towers and refraction-as-forgiveness evasion; risk in poetic conceit heightens stakes, turning familiar rebellion trope via echo-arrows climax. Inevitable hindsight from sigil-curve to spire-remains carving.</comment>
