<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena's motivation roots in grief embodied through hands aching and wire-twisting, driving micro-choices like self-tattooing and crane-making that earn her shift to teaching; contradictory impulses (burying vs. blooming) act in scene, with visible cost in ongoing itch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries (crane coords, flower, stencil) densify pattern toward CR closure in winter communal sharing, reweighting grief with conceptual cost of exposure; orientation anchors early, no shards exceed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory's dome cracks and telescope hollow constrain placements, charging final crane image; sensory selectivity (moonlight slant, wind creak) mirrors internal vines without catalog, POV-filtered through jeweler's precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief stasis vs. generative bloom) signaled early tightens accumulatively via flower-prompted cranes and reciprocity, forcing renunciation of isolation with felt cost in tattoo pain and shared vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief as "stencil, coordinate, folded promise" emerges organically from particulars (vines, cranes, flower), resonant CR in teaching strangers reweights without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "yet to bloom."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with jeweler-specific perceptual signature (petals trembling like real ones, wire uncoiling); rhythmic modulation builds subdued intensity, elisions purposeful under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via image-charged sentences (shadows of vines intertwining); minor paraphrase loops in crane placements (-0.3) but no closure touch, rhythm varies purposefully without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of jewelry/grief with origami coordinates in observatory transforms mourning trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable reciprocity from mentor's artifacts feels organic.</comment>
