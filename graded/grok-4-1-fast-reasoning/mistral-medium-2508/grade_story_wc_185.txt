<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eldrin's motivation for preservation drives consistent micro-choices like unspooling tension to conjure, embodied in trembling fingers and fogged breath. Internal conflict emerges subtly in resisting the thrum while drawing hush, with final understanding as earned reconfiguration. No strong simultaneous contradictions acting in scene slightly limits 9+ entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from tracing walls to conjuring hush, culminating in RR closure: "The storm didn’t end. It changed." with legible conceptual cost (bloom integrated into new harmony, his pulse now mapped). Single continuous scene with orientation anchored early; lens holds cleanly to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Harmonic caves vividly constrain via fractures and thrum, with quartz veins and ice seep mirroring internal hush-seeking; recurring stone/ice charge final exhale-whisper image. Sensory hierarchy (tactile fog, auditory thrum) filters through Eldrin's mapkeeper bias, evolving causally as ripples rewrite walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve hush amid storm) signaled early tightens via conjuring reversal: song falters, ice groans, forcing invitation over escape with felt cost (own pulse etched). Accumulative escalation coheres through density increase to harmonization; agency in exhalation/endurance forecloses dissonance path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of conversation-through-silence emerges organically from particulars: hush as "door" reweights beings' song without moralizing. Final image—"exhale... like a question mark... ice whispered back"—resonates as non-literal answer, charging prior ripple motif with mutual listening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature in ripple/echo diction; rhythmic modulation peaks in short, propulsive conjuring sentences ("The stone’s light flared... The beings’ song faltered."). No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression taught early remains legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "stone warmed... drank in the moisture" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops in peaks. Minor figurative density risks slight overwrites pre-conjuring, but closure image clear; varied openings/paragraphs pass ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-as-map and vibration-invaders transforms harmony tropes via hush-as-choice; risk in lyric textural drive pays off in "lullaby" reconfiguration. Ingenuity peaks in stone-heartbeat closure, inevitable from ripple particulars without late rules.</comment>
