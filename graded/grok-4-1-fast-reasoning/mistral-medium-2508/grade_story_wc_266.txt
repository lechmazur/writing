<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via lifetime crossings versus tonight's pause; final renunciation earned by punch imprint on palm revealing embodied recognition with cost of foreclosed duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening to Charged Poise closure; punch arcing into shallows ("plink") reconfigures stance from guiding to vigil with legible opportunity cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ridgeway as micro-setting constrains threshold choices, evolving causally; water lapping and vigil fires charge final image where "tide" syncs breath.</comment>
