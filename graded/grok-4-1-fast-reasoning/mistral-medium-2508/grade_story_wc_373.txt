<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena's motivation roots in inherited debts and learned lie-rhythms, compelling higher-stakes micro-choices like dangling the fob and laughing; interiority concrete via embodied fob-warmth and sound-hunt. Veyne applies pressure through greed-twitch. Blind spots balanced by competent struggle, but internal contradictions more implied than simultaneous in peak dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Lena's false starts because father's betrayal therefore hunt Veyne, culminating in laugh-induced snap. Orientation anchored by ~100 words (pier, fob, market). Closure as CR—"Lena had captured it"—reprices trust's sound with conceptual cost of internalized debt, legible in fob-tuck and peace-making.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pier/market sensory vivid and selective (tar/rum breath, lantern labyrinth), mirroring internal hunt; piling-shadow constrains crouch, market rules dictate Veyne's fate and Lena's exit. Final pier-creak and dawn-bleed charge closure image, evolving with tide/harbor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture trust-break) signaled early, tightens causally via false-ledger bait to laugh-reversal narrowing Veyne's options. Agency in thwarting forecloses violence path with market-rule cost; pressure coheres to Charged Poise in witnessed snap.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of breaking trust/debts emerges via fob/sound particulars, shifting from hunt to internalized carry; final cigarette-harbor image non-literally answers "sound" premise with resonant unease-cost, no moralizing. Subtext in Veyne's syrup-lie vs. Lena's kind-laugh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias (lie-pauses, twitch-hand); voice rhythmic and textured ("syrup-thick murmur," "promise snapping like dry bone"). Dialogue subtextual/goal-driven ("So was my father"), distinguishing idioms; no head-hopping, compression purposeful at peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "laughed—soft, almost kind—and the sound was the first crack"); varied syntax/rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative coherent/voice-motivated (no muddle in climax laugh-beat), but occasional elevated diction borders overwriting in opener.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms revenge trope via abstract "sound" capture over violence; pirate market/pier fresh synthesis heightens ingenuity. Risky CR closure inevitable from sound-premise, no derivative echoes.</comment>
