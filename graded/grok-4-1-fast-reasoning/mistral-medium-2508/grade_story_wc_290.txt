<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in "lungs tightened... breath turned traitor" yet descent proceeds; final key-drive choice earned by inherited compass need, foreclosing fear-cure with lingering cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain intact: compass transfixes slab therefore descent, key-grab triggers mutiny therefore table-stab DC; closure reconfiguration rewrites city with felt fear-cost in "not cured of the dark."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Roots "writhe slow as sleeping serpents," slick walls constrain claustrophobic choices; compass point as micro-setting charges final warm-pulse image, narrowing descent options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant key-stake tightens causally via mutiny reversal narrowing survival options; agency in key-stab forecloses path with compass-test cost legible in aimed-at-chest threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Remaking doors vs opening emerges organically via blueprint-breath and compass understanding; final cigarette-smoke image resonates rebellion without moralizing, minor final-line articulation dings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with perceptual bias in "lantern flickered... hands that trembled"; rhythmic control heightens stress-degraded thought in mutiny beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; figurative density in climax ("sang... screamed... petals peeling") borders overwrought without muddle, but coherent gothic pattern pays off.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny transforms lost-city trope via living key/compass test; compass-father inheritance and blueprint-rewrite synthesis feels inevitable, bold risk in lyric causality elevates.</comment>
