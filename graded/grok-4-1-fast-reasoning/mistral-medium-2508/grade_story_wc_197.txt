<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's resourcefulness and interiority shine in micro-choices like decoding puddles and inserting the key, revealing contradictory impulses (not a fighter, yet acts). Final renunciation of visibility (quitting, diner anonymity) earned by prior decoding causality. Minor backstory summary slightly abstracts motivation before pivotal booth moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflections, booth appearances/disappearances builds to Charged Poise closure in final shards (booth reappears, key left, line held). Cost legible in "name just another whisper in the static" and ripples. Mosaic shards pattern-taught early (~15%), transitions legible via time jumps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Auric lagoon and puddles constrain choices (reflections map booth) and charge final image (ripples, booth under stars). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (ozone, silt under boots). No white-room; evolves causally with booth materialization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve histories vs indifference) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via Rook's warning and booth names to archive fire/ledger theft. Agency in decoding/acting forecloses safety (quits job). Cost visible in unnoticed survival; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of quiet rebellion emerges from particulars (puddles, keys, static); final image ("key? She'd left it in the door") reweights indifference as ongoing fight without moralizing. Subtext in coded imagery (pretty lie, water rippled).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (fractured reflections as maps); voice modulates rhythmically (short sentences at tension peaks like "She answered."). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("You’re late."). No head-hopping; compression purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; metaphors purposeful (liquid memory) without muddle in peak booth beat. Minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but pattern-taught. No loops; propulsion clear to "The line held."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: puddle-reflection maps to ephemeral booth transforms rebel trope into coded, accumulative rebellion. Risky mosaic heightens stakes; "puddles’ language" inflection inevitable from priors. No derivative echoes.</comment>
