<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in seasonal muteness and preservation drive, revealed through micro-choices like pressing ice to cheek; endurance of dedication earns stasis without deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from setup to strikes; on-page CR closure in ice shatter and dissolution reconfigures wonder's preservation with felt cost of vanishing fragment, legible in "thousand tiny bells... scattering into the sky like seeds."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Iceberg fragment and body as micro-setting constrain sculpture choices and charge final image of dissolution against palm; bluff's wind and hush evolve causally, mirroring internal states through selective sensory filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wonder escalates accumulatively via intensifying strikes thinning ice, forcing stance crystallization in release; cost legible in perfect shatter foreclosing the fragment with agency in tuning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wonder in silence vs. noise emerges organically from particulars like chime sequences and ice pulse; final image of tuning world offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in vibrational language ("ring... shiver") biases noticing toward sounds and glimmers; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, stable third-limited POV enhances lyric intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, varied rhythm passes read-aloud; purposeful lyric metaphors consistent without muddle, no loops dulling closure image of dissolving fragment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mute tuner and iceberg symphonies transforms quiet preservation trope; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via pattern of glisten-to-release.</comment>
