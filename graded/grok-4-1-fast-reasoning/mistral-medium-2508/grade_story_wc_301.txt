<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in methodical stubbornness vs. grief refusal, embodied in shaking hands and bellows hesitation; final renunciation earned via graffiti prompts and sister memory. Minor diagnostic self-awareness ("method was just another word for refusal") slightly abstracts peak motivation without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from graffiti/map to bridge realization; on-page Charged Poise closure in "Not forgiveness. Not yet. But a beginning" reconfigures stance with emotional cost legible in bellows press and right turn. Orientation anchored early in booth/tracks; one tightening via third-bridge decision suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (ivy weight, cracked earth scent) filter through chronicler bias, constraining path as "ivy parted for him" charges final image. Bridge pilings mirror guilt, evolving causally from station to trench.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant forgiveness stake signaled early, escalates accumulatively via graffiti wisdom and medication clarity sharpening internal pressure; agency in journey/renunciation forecloses looking back with felt endurance cost. No live option fully tested beyond introspection, limiting peak tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of land/memory vs. personal forgetting emerges organically from river stains/graffiti to final image repricing maps as lies; resonant non-literal answer in ivy parting reweights guilt without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in chronicler details (water stains, piling marks); rhythmic modulation builds to compressed closure stress. No dialogue, but internal voice coherent and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence length; minor figurative density ("sky... old bruises") in bridge beat nears overwrite without muddle. No loops, but occasional paraphrase in bellows handling (sigh, creak, press).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chronicler guilt via graffiti oracles and walking riverbed transforms redemption trope; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in ivy-parting image without gimmick.</comment>
