<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in refusing to discard the clock yet following the path, earned by the micro-choice to wedge gear into compass with visible cost of renouncing fixes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries densify to pattern recognition; CR closure at "He let it go" reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost of befriended uncertainty, legible in final image of released gear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glowing leaves and subterranean waterfall constrain choices (part to reveal path, speak questions yielding ledger) and charge final image of ashes-to-seeds; sensory details like "air thick with damp earth and something older" filter through tinkerer's bias for broken secrets.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking reason to stop fixing escalates via textural density (compass hum to ledger command), narrowing to improvisation; cost unmistakable in halting clock-winding and gear release, though one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of befriending uncertainty emerges organically from particulars like unmade clock and practicing leaves; final image of city growing wild offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting brokenness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in noticing secrets of broken things ("each tick was a lie"); rhythmic control modulates lyric compression purposefully, taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varying rhythm; minor figurative density ("leaves parted like a crowd making way for a parade") in mid-beats borders overwrite but stays voice-motivated without obscuring peak improvisation clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relics converging beneath ashes transforms tropes of discovery into improvised pattern; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at gear-to-compass wedding.</comment>
