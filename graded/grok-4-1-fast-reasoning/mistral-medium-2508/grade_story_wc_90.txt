<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied lightness ("body hummed, lighter than it should have been") tied to grief's lift, with contradictory fear of light vs. persistent stitching compelling the final push; final choice to step through earned by 300 years of failures, foreclosing isolation with relational gain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via intensifying stitching attempts building to on-page RR closure ("The tear split open... she stayed"); cost legible in "stitches unraveling behind her like a ladder of light" and ship gone; orientation anchored early in observation deck.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ship's bones and faltering gravity constrain stitching ("where the shadows were softest, where the *Eulogy*’s gravity faltered"); photograph as micro-setting evolves (warmer, burns), charging final green grass image; sensory weave purposeful without overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (open dimension) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through snap-failure then wider tear with reaching hands narrowing to push; agency in repeated stitching forces trade-off, cost felt in gravity surge and unraveling at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mending sorrow into renewal emerges organically from stitching acts, reweighted non-literally in final grass/star image answering isolation; no moralizing, ambiguity in "what might have been" lingers with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual bias (grief-shadows, silver thread) modulates rhythmically under pressure; stable single POV, purposeful compression in poetic elision pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with metaphors (needle from star, breath-thread) patterned early without muddle or loops; propulsion peaks in climax ("needle went in again... ship’s bones sang"), varying rhythm flawless on read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bone-ship, AI-compassion stitching transforms last-human trope via shadow work premise; bold lyric risk heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in tear-as-door payoff.</comment>
