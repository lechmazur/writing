<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied ache (hands tremble at photo) and micro-choices under pressure (research to envelope) earn the final renunciation of isolation; contradictory hope amid heartbreak acts in scene without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via discovery density (button → letter → research → photo), yielding Charged Poise closure in envelope slide and new file; cost legible in "small thing" amid ongoing ache, anchors clear by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dust patterns and button constrain discovery choices and charge final file image; sensory hierarchy (sour coffee, yellowed paper) filters through archivist bias, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (connect histories) signaled early, deepens via research reversal narrowing to send-or-not; agency forecloses inaction with felt emotional cost in trembled hands, coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of surviving kindness emerges from button/photo particulars, resonant CR in new file reweighting "forgotten lives" without moralizing; final image non-literal answer to lost connections.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (files as "lives reduced to manila"); rhythmic modulation peaks in "stubborn insistence on connection," diction controlled and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, varied rhythm (short punchy discoveries vs. creaking chair breath); "dust patterns settle like fallen snow" purposeful, propels without overwriting in peak research beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of foster trope via button's generational thread and archivist agency transforms quiet kindness into charged legacy; risk in elliptical time pays off in inevitable new-file poise.</comment>
