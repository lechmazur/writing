<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong arc from hollow endurance to earned dreaming, revealed in picking up the spark and winding the clock; interiority concrete in tactile "weighed nothing and everything, like holding a breath." Minor abstraction in emotions slightly distances embodiment, but change feels motivated without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of surreal images builds to Charged Poise closure in "the sand was green" and Hollow remembering, reconfiguring the dying world with conceptual cost of prior resets legible in the toppled king and frozen clock. Orientation anchored early in train/dunes; poetic shards taught via italics and --- breaks cohere without disorientation. No causality breaks; cost undeniable in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glowing dunes constrain revelation ("sand parted") and charge closure ("dunes bloomed brighter...sand was green"); sensory hierarchy vivid and POV-specific (pulsing algae, sighing sand). Atmosphere tensions decay/renewal purposefully, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate sparks vs. timeline resets) signaled early via humming crate, tightens accumulatively through spark discovery and clock-winding that narrows options with felt cost of resets ("world had already reset too many times"). Agency in Hollow's micro-choices forecloses hollow status; pressure coheres under lens without abstracting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of renewal from fragments emerges organically via shifting images (iced lock to thawed, dunes blooming), culminating in resonant CR: "first true dawn...dreamed of forests" reweights hollowness without moralizing. Subtext in spark's flicker invites ambiguity on resets' cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice with rhythmic italics/modulation ("fractured lullaby") and perceptual bias (dead earth veins) stable in third-limited POV; syntax reflects Hollow's emerging dream-state. Compression purposeful and pattern-taught, enhancing lyric closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "crate’s lock had iced over...chess clock frozen at midnight" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in metaphor density ("Möbius strip of rust and possibility") during peak but consistent/legible, not obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum archive/sparks into post-apoc renewal feels inevitable via clock/spark causality; poetic shards transform tropes boldly, heightening stakes in timeline charm without gimmickry.</comment>
