<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's warmly methodical trait drives micro-choices like reweaving the rope, revealing contradictory impulses between archival training and instinctual merging. Final renunciation—not reaching for her notebook—earned by prior causality with embodied cost in her steady pulse and pocketed seal. No unearned epiphanies; interiority particular and flawed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via reweavings (three tremors), door opens to library, CR closure in breath-merging and vanished door with conceptual cost (unarchivable truth). Orientation anchored by ~50 words (clock tower, Elara, tonight). No causality breaks; pattern taught early pays off seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rope and wax seal handle constrain choices (reweaving triggers gears/door) and charge final image (seamless braids, her initials in warm beeswax). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (oil as incense, grain pulsing). Coherent choreography; gears' stutter mirrors internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate door's impossibility) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via failed grasp of ledger forcing merge-stance. Agency in reweavings narrows options; cost legible in self-dissolution ("her own face reflected"). Minor abstractness in figure's pressure slightly mutes visceral bite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fables of absence emerges implicitly via vanishing names/ledger, answered non-literally by merged breath and unrecorded seal—reweights archiving premise with cost of lived absence. No moralizing; ambiguity (door gone, "being reviewed") lingers productively from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with archival perceptual signature (rope as "method," door as "question"). Voice texture poetic yet controlled (e.g., "ink drying on parchment"); sparse dialogue subtextual, advances via "only merged." Rhythmic modulation peaks at exhale-merge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax/rhythm propel without loops; metaphors consistent (cathedral, held note) and purposeful, no muddle in peak reweaving beats. Minor figurative density in opener integrated via pattern. Propulsion clean to final chime.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: archival ritual unlocks fable-library where self-merge trumps recording, transforming hidden-door trope via rope-reconfiguring logic. Risky CR closure (no notebook) inevitable from established absence-pattern, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
