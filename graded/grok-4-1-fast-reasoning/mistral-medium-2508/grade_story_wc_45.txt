<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional: Liora's forgiving skepticism embodied in picking the tooth without screaming despite aching symbols, compelling the shrewd bargain; contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. action) act in scene, earning closure choice with needle's hum as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tooth pickup triggers garden reaction, changeling memories, and bargain DC; closure on-page as tooth dissolves and brother returns whole, with needle hum as legible cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful: well symbols and pulsing flowers constrain bargain choice; garden's sigh and mint-iron scent mirror internal cleft, charging needle's hum in final pocket moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend brother's loss) signaled early, tightens via changeling lunge-to-forehead press sharing memories, forcing Liora's agency in bargain; cost unmistakable in humming needle and dream of new teeth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mending cracks emerges organically from bone-setting to world-setting; final image of steady hands and well water meeting sky offers resonant reconfiguration of mistakes-as-stars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (teeth ache from symbols, palms smooth); dialogue natural/subtextual ("You’re not him"), rhythm modulates from discovery to charged poise at brother's grin.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax (short punchy bargins amid lyric images); no loops/artifacts, figurative language purposeful (vines tremble like embers) without muddle in peak memory-drown beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms changeling trope via bone-setting bargain and mistakes-to-constellations map; risk in garden's rule-bending (wound-spun door) heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via needle's persistence.</comment>
