<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leeward's drive to "dub" obstacles roots in traits like twitching at cloud-strings and leaning into sway; restlessness shifts to "thrill of the next note" via earned micro-choices, with embodied contradiction in laughing amid uncertainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as strikes densify patterns (thunk-ping to cascade-chimes) toward sea's hum-chord, landing Charged Poise RR in final raise where fear reconfigures to thrill with legible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Driftwood orchard constrains strikes (root, pot, shells, heart-knot) and mirrors internals via swaying tilt; recurring pear fruits glow to charge "orchard would sink or soar" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to dub sea escalates accumulatively via cloud-hand to sea-voice, agency in heart-strike crystallizing shared euphony; cost felt as restlessness reweights without resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Obstacle-to-instrument theme emerges via strikes reshaping fractals to chorus, final "world leaned in" reweighting premise through charged ambiguity of sink/soar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Musical perceptual signature ("clouds...unplayed sheet music," "resonance waiting to be coaxed") rhythms with intensity, stable close-third POV modulating to raw laugh under peak hum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High-density propulsion in lines like "clouds fractured into a thousand shards," varied rhythm without loops or muddle sustains closure's "mallet was warm now, pulsing like a second heart."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Synesthetic prophet dubs fractal sky-sea via orchard-xylophone transforms weather tropes boldly, inevitable in "sea answered...with a voice" payoff heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
