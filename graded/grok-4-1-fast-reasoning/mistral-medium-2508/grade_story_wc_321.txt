<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's resilient positivity compels the climax ritual, with "She didn’t panic. Fear was a luxury..." embodying contradictory impulses under unraveling pressure; micro-choices like whispering timeline names earn the closure endurance with visible cost to drift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density buildup to pattern snap ("The patterns in the starlight *snapped* into place"), delivering RR closure with felt friction cost drunk by hourglass; single scene coherent, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Spectral grotto's pulsing starlight and liquid silver water constrain wheel alignment and hourglass ritual, charging the sealing-to-moonlight final image; sensory details filtered through Lira's pattern-seeing bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of merging to avert unraveling tightens via radio's five-minute warning into Lira's agency-driven ritual; cost legible in ferry's everywhere-at-once shudder foreclosing drift option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of resilient transience emerges via hourglass evolution and ferry's vanishing affirmation; final rising sand offers non-literal reweighting of impermanence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("clocks run sideways") modulates rhythm under stress; dialogue subtextual and voice-distinct, eliding nothing to obscure closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds propels via varied rhythm; coherent metaphors like "needle through too many layers" enhance climax without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Time-pattern synthesis transforms ferry trope into fresh, inevitable resilience; risk-taking in lyric texture heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
