<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions, like vibrations in shoes and bones aligning with "eloquently silent" failure; final shift from ender to crosser earned via micro-choices under pressure, no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from letters to mirror tuning; CR closure in "the ledger was the room" reconfigures prior failure with felt cost of reframed life, on-page via final writing act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sepia room and crank handle constrain choices (floor strike, mirror tune) and charge final glowing image; selective sensory details like "pressure" wave mirror internal resonance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bridging intuition tightens accumulatively via reflection's "wrong note" reversal, narrowing to tuning act with legible cost of prior grasping silence; agency in progressive handling forecloses failure path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth in silence emerges organically from wave patterns and mirror, resonant in golden ink writing without moralizing; final image reweights dynasty premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature on resonances and shadows; rhythmic prose modulates elegantly under pressure, no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax and no loops/artifacts; purposeful figurative waves propel without muddle, even in peak mirror beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of physics metaphor (standing waves as intuition bridge) transforms inheritance trope; risk in abstract-tactile closure feels inevitable and heightens stakes.</comment>
