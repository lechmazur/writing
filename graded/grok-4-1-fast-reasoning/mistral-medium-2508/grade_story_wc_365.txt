<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora's sensory maps and contradictory impulses—outward sensing vs. inward expansion—act simultaneously in the climax, earning her step through the seam with embodied thrill as cost. Micro-choices like pocketing the shard reveal values under pressure. Flawless interiority avoids epiphanies until dramatized in "She was the map now."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of resonances builds to pattern break at closure's Charged Poise ("Liora stepped forward—and the universe bent to meet her"), reconfiguring her as endless map with felt promise/cost. Orientation anchors early; one tightening via shard's change narrows options. Seam's redirect teaches experimental ellipsis paid off on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring shard constrains choices (pocketed, burns, held up) and charges final image as whole bottle. Sensory hierarchy (vibrations/scents over visuals) reflects Liora's bias, integrated into action like "boot heel struck something sharp." Atmosphere tensions surreal seams with lived-in rust/ozone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel withheld truth) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density to inward map expansion forcing seam's reopening. Agency in closing eyes/holding dual shards forecloses evasion path with thrill-as-cost legible in "weight in her chest." Pivotal redirect tests commitment without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-weaving emerges implicitly from shard/seam/map particulars, reweighted in final reconfiguration without moral ("truth wasn’t in the shard... but in the weaving"). Subtext in silences (intercom hints) and irony (half-remembered man solidifies) invites ambiguity. Charged image answers premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (maps as "lattice of vibrations, scents") biases noticing; voice modulates rhythmically from thrum to hum. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You left this behind" corrected), advances closure. No head-hopping; diction fits lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm (short punchy peaks like "The seam pulsed."); purposeful italics/fragments enhance texture without muddle. Minor weight motif repetition across beats adds textural accumulation, not loop. Zero scaffolds; final line recharges opening motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lyric sci-fi: sensory-map weaving transforms multiverse tropes via grounded shard/seam physics felt in hand. Risky nonlinear seam-snaps heighten stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight: green-to-clear shift grows from early parallel cue.</comment>
