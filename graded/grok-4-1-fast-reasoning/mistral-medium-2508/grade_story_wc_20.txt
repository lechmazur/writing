<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear vs. drive to rival Veyra) act in scene via steady hands despite rib tremor; final self-transmutation earned by prior micro-choices like feeding coin. Interiority concrete and alchemist-specific (balances poison/cure).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: coin pulse to melting light tightens density toward Charged Poise closure in vial memory and self-transmutation; cost legible in "backlash would reduce her to ash" and felt regret reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Foundry constrains choices (crucible lip, workbench vial) and charges final image (gilded seams mirror internal mending); sensory hierarchy alchemist-biased (embers, rust, heat shiver).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (balance Veyra's legacy weight) signaled early, escalates via coin-fed risk narrowing to vial uncorking; agency in redemption choices under Accumulative lens with visible backlash cost charging final transmutation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of gilding cracks emerges organically from coin-melt to vial's "names are scars"; final workshop furnace image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (alchemical balances, weights) modulates rhythmically; stable close third-person limited, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "coin pulsed faintly... answered, a shiver"); varied rhythm, no loops or muddled metaphors in peak coin-melt beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kintsugi-alchemy transforms rivalry trope into self-transmutation; risk-taking in factually mystical lyricism heightens stakes organically.</comment>
