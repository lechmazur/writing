<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak perfectly in "Logic demanded she run. Emotion demanded she stay," earning the key-turn choice with embodied cost as nerves rewrite into ethereal state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via vibration density building to RR/Charged Poise closure when beam shoots skyward and artifact stabilizes, with her fleshly cost legible in "nerves rewriting themselves into something less human."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains climax as it "sang back, fracturing into geometric patterns," charging final image; body-as-micro-setting (bones vibrate, molars ache) mirrors and narrows perception under stress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to stabilize thinning-ice artifact tightens via protagonist's descent and key-turn agency, foreclosing flight with unraveling cost felt in collapse and ragged gasps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sonic absolution reweights from erasure to matching in climax chord, answered non-literally by hymn-beam and stirring ancient as "forgiven by physics," with counter-reading in patient listener below.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature fixates on frequencies as character bias ("language only she understood"); rhythmic lyricism modulates from grounded boots to ethereal laugh without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density propels via layered senses without loops or muddle; metaphors cohere in "dissolve guilt like sugar in tea," peaking clearly in "chord so pure it peeled the salt from the air."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sonic bomb premise synthesizes fresh via ice-dampener physics and flesh-cost adaptation; risk in ethereal transformation feels inevitable from early key-theft and vibration motif.</comment>
