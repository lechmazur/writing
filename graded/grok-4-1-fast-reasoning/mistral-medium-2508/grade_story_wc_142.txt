<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between order (brass cuff) and chaos (spray can twitch), embodied guilt (pocket burns), micro-choices earn endurance; minor reflective summary slightly dilutes peak agency in chip embedding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of graffiti acts builds to Charged Poise closure in chip-embedded mural; cost legible in "guilty secret" and "still time" with city bobbing free.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Raft city's sway and waterways constrain graffiti map choice; sensory selectivity (paint hiss, neon flicker) charges final scattered lights image without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resist developers) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to chip embedding foreclosing orderly betrayal path; cost felt in chest tighten and dual gnaw, but no sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of chaos-order bridges emerges via murals/sundial; final "building a third" image resonantly reweights allegiance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable POV perceptual bias (intuitive symbols) with poetic rhythm modulating pressure; dialogue subtextual (Jax mutter vs her grin), distinct voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels to closure; minor fig stack ("drunken dream," "swirling lines") purposeful, no loops or drift in peak paint beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh graffiti-encoding transforms gentrification trope; raft carnival synthesis feels organic, risk in lyric accumulation heightens defiance.</comment>
