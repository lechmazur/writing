<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's drive to honor his ancestor fuels micro-choices like sprinting to the deck and burning the journal, with contradictory impulses (obey alarms vs. act) embodied in trembling fingers and whispered tests. Final renunciation forecloses the path with felt relief in the laughter. Liora's secondary pressure via comms reveals her nervous confidence without headcount bloat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain from unearthing box to pressing nail triggers rip and snap-back, culminating in DC via burning journal with legible cost in ashes and reconfigured sky. Single scene holds lens without shards or ambiguity; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Storm's static air and howling wind constrain outdoor action and charge climax (nail to glass rips reality); station's observation deck grounds spatial choreography. Sensory narrowing under crisis (fogging goggles, pulsing nail) reflects Elias's priorities, evolving to post-storm sky-door image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove ancestor's bravery, open threshold) signaled early tightens via nail-press reversal (glimpse then snap), forcing renunciation with embodied cost (curled on knees, shattered glass). Agency in defiance of alarms; moral calculus (bravery as turning lock vs. staying) peaks visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of reversible exile vs. earned stasis emerges via nail/journal particulars, reweighted in burning (relief laughter answers "brave are those who turn the lock"). Final image non-literally resolves without moralizing; ancestor irony adds resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable on Elias, perceptual bias (knowing in nail's hum) distinct; prose rhythm modulates from howling wind to furnace flames. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Liora's "Maw’s moving" pressures); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied sentences (short pressure drops, long rips); density high with multi-job lines (e.g., "nail pulsed warmer... final stanza burned"). No loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (sky as door/trap).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm-portal via backward-bending jet stream and humming nail transforms tropes; risk in quiet stasis closure (burning) heightens inevitability without gimmick.</comment>
