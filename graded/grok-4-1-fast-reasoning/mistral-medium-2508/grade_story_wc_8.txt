<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's emotionally rational trait shows in non-panic response to the message and confrontation, with pulse betrayal adding contradiction; final papers reveal earned via prior codex chase. Callahan applies sharp pressure as foil. Minor slip: motivation tells more than fully embodies in early beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: crate open therefore message, arrival therefore papers reveal, escape CR with conceptual cost (lie exposed, abbey ties undone). Orientation anchors in first paragraph. One tightening via parallels suffices; photo pocket seals legible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy and shadows constrain escape choice, rosebush charges final image with petal drop reweighting lie's end. Sensory details (damp air, mildew, torch) filter via Elias's priorities, vivid without stall. Spatial choreography clear through confrontation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose noble lie) signaled early, tightens via papers narrowing Callahan's righteousness; agency in laying deeds forecloses burial path with abbey cost. Police arrival complicates without resolving. Escalation causal, cost legible in slack face.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Noble lies theme emerges via ledger-to-papers parallels, final image (tracks into dark) resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in dialogue ("tend" vs "bury"); ambiguity in faith's unravel lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature (truth as tended plant); dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("rescuing things better left buried"). Rhythm modulates tension, no head-hopping; literary diction fits historian.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels; metaphors purposeful (ivy suffocating mirrors lie) without muddle in climax. Minor template cadence in opening petals/rosebush lines (−0.3); no loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: codex ledger plus modern deeds transforms church trope via parallels method. Risk in quiet CR escape heightens ingenuity; no derivative template feel.</comment>
