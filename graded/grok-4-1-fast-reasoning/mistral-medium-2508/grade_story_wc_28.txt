<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation intensifies through embodied mending under threat, earning commander's conversion; contradictory grief-as-weapon shows in precise whispers despite past finger-breaking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: naming tesserae builds density to commander's shadow (tightening), culminating in sword drop and glowing stones as RR/Charged Poise with shared grief cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mosaic tesserae constrain choices as map/tool, charging final gold-filled cracks; sensory selection (charred cedar, dust) filters via Elias's priorities, evolving with plaza's hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend vs. erasure) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via commander confrontation forcing endurance; cost legible in wavering sword and knelt naming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of cradling mercy emerges organically from naming acts to commander joining, resonant in "cracks filled with gold" reweighting fire's erasure without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (tesserae as memory-map); dialogue subtextual, distinct (Elias defiant, commander breaking), rhythm modulates tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels (e.g., "sword clattered" propulsion); no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures cohere without muddle in peak sword beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mosaic-naming as grief-weapon transforms fire trope, risk in subtle magic earns hindsight inevitability at glowing stones.</comment>
