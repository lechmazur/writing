<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied ("breath hitched", "gasping"), with micro-choices under pressure like threading the film revealing character; earned realization at climax ("stored him all along") shows contradictory hunt yielding renunciation. Minor abstraction in "incubate the truth" borders label-speak but doesn't flatten pivotal acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as visions densify to CR closure: final threading and shutdown reconfigure external hunt to internal storage with emotional cost legible in "Goodbye" whisper and "let the dark have its say". Orientation anchored early (booth, crystal gazer); single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Selective sensory vividness (ozone, storm's "hushed thunder") integrates with action; booth's projector/reels constrain choices and charge final image ("turned off the projector"), mirroring internal shift from flicker to dark.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate stored love/letters) signaled early, deepens via psychometry visions narrowing to internal realization; agency in final threading/endurance forecloses external search with felt cost in acceptance, but escalation leans textural over sharp agency turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love as absence/stored echoes emerges organically from film gaps and visions; resonant CR ending ("silence did... heard his voice... in the space between her ribs") reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (spatial "labyrinth of time", "gaps between frames") stable in single tight POV; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, no elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (varied rhythm, strong verbs); figurative language purposeful and pattern-taught (light/flicker motifs), but minor density in peak visions ("swirls... coil", "unfolded like origami") risks slight overwrit without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry, celluloid memories, and internal storage transforms trope of lost love; risk in spatial/lyric frame heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via booth logic.</comment>
