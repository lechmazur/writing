<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied details like palm on cage grooves revealing contradictory impulses (father's instincts hum but he seeks understanding); final renunciation of running feels earned via accumulated reflections. Minor limit: micro-choices under pressure are observational rather than sharply conflicted in pivotal lion cage moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density tightening to CR closure ("the art of leaving something behind... as proof") where cost of acceptance is legible in "didn’t wonder what came next" and train creaking. Single scene anchored early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (damp wood, old greasepaint, grooves in metal) filter through Elias's priorities and constrain reflection; lion cage and train charge final image, mirroring internal shift as train "settling into the earth."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover why paths circle) signaled early and deepens accumulatively via memories and cage realization, narrowing to renunciation; cost unmistakable in pocketed lira as "secret he no longer needed" and unhurried walk away.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of spirals vs. circles emerges organically from particulars (money, cage, train); resonant CR ending reweights premise non-literally via "proof" image without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature biases toward philosophical imagery (e.g., "fear was just another kind of currency"); rhythmic control heightens quiet pressure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors; minor scaffold in repeated "calm" phrasing purposeful under voice but borders template cadence. No loops dulling closure image of cigarette flick and shadow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of robber's son amid startup ruins and circus relics transforms trope into spiral path metaphor; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via father's whispers.</comment>
