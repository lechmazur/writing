<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation rooted in sibling loss, with contradictory impulses (detachment vs obsession) acting in micro-choices like overriding despite alarms; earned closure renunciation feels particular. Minor slip in stock phrasing like "stomach drop" but doesn't touch pivotal override.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: query/image/numbers/search/logs/action chain narrows options to DC closure (slotting crystal restores files at cost of "flagged for termination"); orientation anchored immediately in archive/job, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (humming servers, warm patch, flaring firewalls) constrains choices (override resists system) and charges final image (patch to chest amid alarms); recurring patch as micro-setting reweights absence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover scrubbed memories vs archival suppression) signaled early, escalates via causal tightening (numbers unlock resisted logs, forcing override/slotting agency); cost legible in termination flag and her smile/embrace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of consumed memory emerges organically from data-eating archive and restored songs; CR closure reweights premise via "archive silent" after heartbeat/song, with numbers' final rearrangement as resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (data-curating lens on glitches/lies); distinct sci-fi poetic voice modulates rhythm under stress (short sentences at unlock/alarm). Elias' log/hologram lines natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (varying lengths build thrum to alarms); metaphors consistent/voice-motivated (data graves, angry stars) without muddle. Minor overwrite in opening simile string but no loops or scaffold touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival horror (consuming undeletable whispers) via personal numbers trail and willing unwriting; risk-taking in recursive data limbo heightens stakes organically to CR closure.</comment>
