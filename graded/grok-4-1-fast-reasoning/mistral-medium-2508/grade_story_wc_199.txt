<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied actions like tucking the speck in her cheek and reading runes with fingertips; final transformation earned by prior sorting motif and micro-choices. Contradictory impulses subtle in unflinching response to monuments amid sacred task. No other characters, so single-POV excels without relational slips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: leaf patterns and monument activations build density to CR closure in transformation and grove reveal ("The arbor was gone. In its place stood a grove"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening via speck prod splits bark, roots form ladder with legible cost in her changed form.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ashen arbor and monuments constrain choices (climb to crown, roots ladder) and charge final image (grove of saplings); sensory hierarchy via Liora's fingertip reading and seed humming. Details evolve causally (bark splits silver, monuments melt/rise/dissolve). Micro-setting via palm-embedded star pulses with heartbeat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding arbor's secrets) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern breaks (speck unfolds, runes spell, arbor answers); agency in prods/building/climbing/eating forecloses sorter identity with transformation cost ("skin dappled with bark, fingers tipped with thorns"). Pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of sorting as recognizing root-ready stories emerges via particulars (singing seeds, leaf runes, sapling whisper); final image ("she got to work" amid humming grove) reweights premise non-literally as "prophecy was a seed." No moralizing; ambiguity in "hush as inhale" lingers earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (seeds "sang," leaves "spelling"); rhythmic modulation peaks in closure ("neither seed nor sorter, but something in between"). No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early via whispers/patterns, legible at CR payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "leaves began to fall in earnest now, not drifting but spelling"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, figurative coherence in pulsing/singing motifs. Propulsion aligns with escalation; closure image crisp without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: folklore speck transforms sorter into prophecy-gardener via arbor's monuments; risk in lyric escalation heightens stakes without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight via early sorting motif to grove reprise; no derivative echoes.</comment>
