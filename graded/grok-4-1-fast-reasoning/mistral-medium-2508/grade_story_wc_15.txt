<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of contradictory impulses ("didn’t know why... or perhaps he did") and haunting optimism driving persistence to chamber touch; final awakening change earned via prior sleepwalking causality with aching bones as cost. Interiority particular to weaver (callouses tracing grooves). Minor abstraction in "older knowing" doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to on-page RR/CR ("labyrinth shifted... paths unraveled"); orientation anchored by ~50 words (canyon, tide pools, Elias); closure cost legible in "bones aching" and new carvings reweighting maze to loom. Lens holds cleanly; no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Red canyon walls and Heart Chamber constrain sleepwalking paths and charge final shimmer; sensory hierarchy (brine/copper via weaver bias) integrates with action; recurring stone veins mirror internal shift without overt symbol. Micro-setting (illustration on stone) pivotal at climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend ruins to reverence) tightens accumulatively to chamber glow and touch, narrowing unknowing to reconfiguration; agency in embodied persistence forecloses dead-end paths with felt ache/opportunity cost. Escalation subtle but coherent under lens; one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of naming ruins to sacred emerges organically via weaving motif shifting at "labyrinth wasn’t a maze. It was a loom"; final winged shadow reconfigures without moralizing, resonant CR with conceptual cost. Particulars (mother's verse reprise) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with weaver-specific perceptual signature ("half-remembered hymn", stitch metaphors); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in dawn step; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers tracing grooves... carved prayers"); varied rhythm accelerates to shift; weaving metaphors consistent without muddle or loops. Minor figurative density in opening fits taught pattern, untouched at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh labyrinth-as-loom synthesis transforms maze trope via sleepweaver agency; risk-taking in accumulative lyric heightens stakes (ruin/reverence calculus non-obvious). Final verse/image inevitable in hindsight; no derivative echoes.</comment>
