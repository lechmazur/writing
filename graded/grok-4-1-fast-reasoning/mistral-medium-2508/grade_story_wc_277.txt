<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between regret orbit and intervention act simultaneously in ledger scrutiny; final writing choice earned by patterned observations with embodied grief-relief laugh. Father's ledgers reveal betrayal aligning actions with motive to exhume truths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: journalist call anchors orientation by para 2, revelations density-build to Charged Poise CR in "The orbit breaks here" with legible grief-cost laugh. Two-shard descent transition legible; plates as motivated payoff without teleport.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory acoustics carry sounds pressuring awareness (chair creak, tea clink); rosewood nib as micro-setting handled recurrently constrains choices, charges final ledger act. Sensory hierarchy via observant POV filters details purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (inherit to revive truth vs bury) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ledger betrayal to plates deepening knowledge; agency in dipping nib for new ledger forecloses regret path with laugh's half-grief cost charging tea image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orbits concept reweights from circling failure to breakage via particulars without statement; final "orbit breaks here" and tea clink offer non-literal resonant answer to regret's premise, embracing ambiguity in indifference of stars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with observant perceptual signature (patterns over stars); rhythmic diction modulates from solemn interior to playful laugh-relief, dialogue sparse/natural (caretaker's "Miss Voss"). No head-hopping, inference matches knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (breath fogs dome advances isolation); metaphors cohere orbit/comet without muddle in peak plates reveal. Zero loops, varied syntax/paragraphs breathe with scene; opening anchors stakes, close recharges via clink.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh observatory-journalism synthesis transforms inheritance trope via logic professor method and pen-ledger orbit metaphor; risk in solemn-playful laugh-grief at plates heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
