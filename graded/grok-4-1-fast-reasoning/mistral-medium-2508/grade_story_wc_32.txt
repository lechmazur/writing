<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in feeding memories then doubt to the crozier, earning the final triumphant endurance against guild exile; embodied emotion peaks in skin prickling as scars reverse. Interiority particular and flawed without hedging. Final change forecloses apologetic past with cost of heresy legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from failed retort to crozier feeding, culminating in on-page CR as "the world remade itself around the sound" with conceptual cost of interrupted destinies. Orientation anchored by para 1; single scene tightens meaningfully. No lens ambiguity, cost proof in frozen bloom erasing wounds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ember nexus and crozier constrain choices (e.g., slamming broken end into heartstone) and charge final garden image; sensory hierarchy (cold hunger, frost breath) reflects alchemist urgency. Details tactile/lived-in, evolve causally to glass petals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vivify via destruction) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through successive feedings narrowing to forbidden incantation; agency in "Let it be worse" forecloses guild path with cost of reversal (scars unmade, but heresy). Escalation driven by protagonist under lens, price unmistakable in nexus roar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of creative destruction emerges implicitly from particulars (failures fed to crozier), reweighted non-literally in final "stopped pretending destruction was the enemy" echoing early guild sighs. Resonance inextricable from arc, invites ambiguity without false balance. No moralizing, counter-readings linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (alchemical bias: "vessel meant to channel grace, now capable only of jagged edges"); rhythmic diction modulates to peak compression in explosion. Voice distinct, prose as character reflects obsessed mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "wave of frozen bloom unfurled" does image/action/emotion); rhythm varies, no loops/artifacts dull closure. Minor figurative density in bloom metaphors purposeful and pattern-taught, but slight overwrites propulsion in opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy as "interrupting death at the root" transforms trope via crozier hunger and penny-drop CR; bold imagery (crystal petals locking mid-bloom) inevitable in hindsight, risks heighten stakes organically.</comment>
