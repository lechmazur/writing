<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's claustrophobia is embodied in pulse hammering and distant scream during transition, driving contradictory impulses that earn his final endurance; motivation to stand by unremembered compels higher-stakes choice at seam without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of ripples, seams, and pulsing cables builds to Conceptual Repricing closure in gold fleck gleaming and invisible light in bones, with undeniable conceptual cost of awakening the kept; orientation anchored early in descent, shards legible via transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Damp concrete, silt-buried junction, phase seam constrain choices like pressing palm before tide seals; recurring cables and gold fleck charge final image, sensory hierarchy (hiss, hush, blue glow) reflects urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of retrieving unremembered tightens via detector spike and tide clock, forcing agency in transition with felt cost of personal unraveling; escalation deepens knowledge of cables keeping, narrowing options coherently under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries between remembered/unremembered emerges organically from cable memory and seam passage, final CR reweights premise via "something turned over in its rest, finally seen" without moralizing; resonant ambiguity in Elias's transformation lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in mapping unremembered and biased noticing of grooves/seams; voice texture modulates rhythm from shallow breath to singing cables, purposeful compression legible under lens without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "cables singing as he passed," rhythm varies with urgency; minor overwrite in metaphor density (serpents, ghosts) during descent doesn't obscure, but "clausrophobia" typo dings proofreading; no loops, scaffold clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cables as remembering entities via phase seams transforms trope of haunted facility; risk in quiet CR heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from codex key to awakening, no derivative echoes.</comment>
