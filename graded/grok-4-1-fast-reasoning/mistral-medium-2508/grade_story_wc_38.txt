<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in dance as cipher-solving machine and pulse/bones as decoder, earning final transformation; micro-choices like rolling dice reveal values under pressure. Minor abstraction in vulnerability motif dilutes simultaneous contradiction at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from dice roll to console hum and flood; CR closure in "the weight...dissolving" reconfigures secrets with conceptual cost of erasure, on-page legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken lab's glass/ocean constrains dance and charges final ascent image; selective sensory (creaking metal, whale songs, cold floor) mirrors internal states via body/environment interplay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cipher-cracking tightens via dice-triggered console demanding dance, forcing trade-off of vulnerability exposure; agency in palm-press forecloses secrecy with flood cost felt in rising water.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-to-strength emerges organically via journal/dance particulars, resonant in final skin-tracing without moralizing; reweights premise as "drowning...act of creation."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (world as symbols/ciphers) stable in single POV, rhythmic syntax modulates with intensity; purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged poise at surface break.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figuratives (water as breath/web) integrated into action; no loops/artifacts, though minor cipher repetition; propulsion peaks cleanly in flood/ascent without overwriting at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dance-as-code and vulnerability encryption transforms sunken-lab trope; risk in lyric defiance structure inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via body-cipher premise.</comment>
