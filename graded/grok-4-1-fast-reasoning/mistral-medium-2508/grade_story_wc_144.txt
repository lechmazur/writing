<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's blind perception feels particular and embodied in "its presence hummed in the air, a vibration through the soles of his boots," rooting motivation in concrete traits; micro-choices like water refraction reveal values, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of sensory patterns building to Charged Poise closure in final watch image, with legible cost of endless mending ("a dozen other broken things waited"); orientation anchors immediately, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist and water barrel constrain diagnosis and charge final ripple image, with sensory hierarchy (vibrations, ripples over sight) reflecting Elias's bias; depot evolves causally as mist parts post-repair.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ship's flawed navigation) tightens via anchor lift urgency, narrowing options under accumulative lens; repair agency forecloses disaster with felt cost in captain's call and parted mist, but one tightening suffices without deeper reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patient mending over ambition emerges organically from refraction patterns and final watch beat, reweighting premise in "The world was full of things that needed mending" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in tactile/light metaphors ("dipped his fingers into the barrel’s surface, rippling the reflection"); captain's "polished brass" line carries subtext; rhythmic control heightens calm pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in varied syntax ("Lumen darted forward, its optical sensors drinking in..."); no loops or muddled metaphors, figurative language purposeful (mist "second skin") without overwriting in peak repair.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind artisan decoding "feedback" via drone/water transforms trope, with risk in poetic sensory world; ship's fix feels inevitable from early vibrations, heightening ingenuity.</comment>
