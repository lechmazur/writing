<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's reticence yields to fragile hope in crystal obsession and hand-taking; contradictory impulses surface in trembling climb and adrift hush, earning final choice with isolation's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as crystal distortions build density to CR: "the hush wasn’t an absence. It was a breath held"; orientation anchors by para 2, woman's arrival tightens without resolving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal constrains experiment and charges departure image; dawn's "fractured gold" and sonic warping filter through Elias's priorities, evolving with discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake to decode growth deepens via playback revealing silences' pulse, woman's words force global reweighting; hand-taking forecloses solitude with legible relational cost under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Suspended growth emerges implicitly via crystal sequences; final "pattern wasn’t in the growing. It was in the listening" reconfigures hush without moralizing, resonating through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with sonic perceptual signature ("cough became a sigh"); woman's "weathered" dialogue distinct from Elias's whispers, rhythm modulates hush to dawn pulse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in echo lines ("Become… to but… end not… cease to") propels without loops; varied rhythm breathes with discovery, no artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sonic crystals rewriting dictionaries transforms silence trope via underground growth pattern; reticent scholar's arc to chorus feels inevitable, bold lyric risk heightens stakes.</comment>
