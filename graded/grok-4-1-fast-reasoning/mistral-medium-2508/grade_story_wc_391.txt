<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between Lior's patient mapping and the world's fury act in scene via ear-to-strut listening; final walk onto rising viaduct earned by prior micro-choices with isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory density builds to viaduct's shiver and rise; charged poise closure reconfigures revolution with conceptual cost of quiet over clamor in "it began to rise."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Basalt cliff carvings and viaduct hum constrain patient observation; lake ice charges final walk, mirroring internal thaw in "boots leaving no mark."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of patient proof escalates accumulatively via tremor to groan to rise, narrowing violent options; cost legible in sanctuary abandonment as Lior steps onto ice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Patient revolution emerges organically from viaduct ascent reweighting impatience motifs; final shadow-bridge image offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in moon-path patience; rhythmic diction modulates tension in "a sound like a thousand drawn bows."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; "hummed—a wildness restrained, a song held just below the threshold" does triple duty for voice, image, theme without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moon-aligned viaduct transforms revolution trope into patient mechanics; fresh synthesis inevitable in rising shadow, risking quiet closure payoff.</comment>
