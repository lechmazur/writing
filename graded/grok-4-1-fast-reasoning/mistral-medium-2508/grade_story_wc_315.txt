<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear vs forward motion) act in scene via embodied choices like stepping into dark despite burden; final endurance earned by prior causality with buckle's weight as felt cost. Minor poetic abstraction slightly distances peak interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from radio crackle to securing payload, landing Charged Poise RR closure ("The pattern held. For now.") with undeniable burden cost in boot imprints and tucked buckle. Orientation anchored early; no causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent spores, arbor sway, and buckle constrain choices (balancing, descent) and charge final image (spores on wind, boot imprints); sensory hierarchy reflects pattern-seeking POV narrowing to immediacies like ozone scent under gust.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secure payload, preserve trust) signaled early via radio; textural deepening via descent cadence narrows options, agency in landing/securing forecloses disaster path with felt endurance cost. Minor abstractness softens one live trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of patterns-in-absence/watcher's burden emerges organically via buckle/spores recurrences shifting to "pattern held" resonance without moralizing; final image reweights trust-as-self-packed parachute non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (grooves, weights of absence); rhythmic control modulates from poised crouch to descent compression, radio voice natural/subtextual. No elisions or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy descent lines vs breathing arbor opens); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peaks—e.g., "soundless snap" propels cleanly. Minor dense figurative layering coherent but hairline thick in opener.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh lyric sci-fi synthesis of mentor-drop tropes via arbor-clouds frame and pattern-seeking lens feels inevitable; risk in textural descent heightens stakes/coherence without gimmickry, buckle reconfigures trust organically.</comment>
