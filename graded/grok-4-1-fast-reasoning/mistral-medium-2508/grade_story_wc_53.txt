<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the ghost confrontation ("I’m not here to go back... to make sure she doesn’t follow"), earning the final surrender with embodied cost in ribs and whispered admission; ghosts as self-iterations deepen interior conflict without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragment density builds to ghost chorus and lagoon churn, delivering Charged Poise closure in the jump ("the lagoon didn’t ripple. It remembered") with undeniable conceptual cost of submersion; orientation anchored early, one tightening via emerging Liras suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lagoon as micro-setting constrains the climax jump and charges final image with tactile memory-hands; selective sensory details (ozone, chipped paint, thicker mist) filter through Lira's scavenger bias, evolving causally without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of blocking past selves escalates accumulatively via ripple-word "coward" and choral accusations, forcing agency in shield-raise and jump; cost unmistakable in hands pulling under, foreclosing escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of inescapable past emerges organically from blueprint-crumples to blank frame and final submersion, offering non-literal answer in carousel-restart hint; no moralizing, resonance from particulars like camera ghosts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in fractured syntax ("time had frayed like the hem"); sparse dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("You don’t get to decide"), modulating rhythm under pressure without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies propulsively (short punchy sentences in chorus, breathing elongations in jump); figurative vehicles consistent and voice-integrated, no overwriting in peak churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of self-ghosts, memory-lagoon, and camera-film as eroded ambition artifacts feels inevitable and risky, transforming trope of regret into charged poise without gimmickry.</comment>
