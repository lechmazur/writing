<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the climax when the blower fails and real laughter rises, compelling Elias's renunciation with visible cost in leaving his instrument; interiority concrete via hands remembering pull cord and embodied grief. Final choice earned by prior causality. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: density builds via repeated blower pulls to blower sputter and real laughter emergence, landing Charged Poise CR in final image of abandoned blower "like an accusation" with undeniable emotional cost. Orientation anchored early (tunnel mouth, household above). Single-shard scope perfect; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tunnel echo chamber and leaf blower constrain choices (acoustics twist fake laughter) and charge closure (blower left pointing upward); sensory wind/hum selective via Elias's bias. Micro-setting (pull cord handle) evolves tactilely. Specificity mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore laughter) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via blower failure forcing stance shift; agency in climbing ladder/renouncing with cost (dream of endless pulling, abandonment). One deepening sufficient; minor abstractness in "unspoken" slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (unspoken grief needs hearing, not artificial tending) emerges via particulars like macerated silence into laughter echo, reweighted in final image of living laughter rising naturally; resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in false vs. real giggles layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (sound/wind obsession); rhythmic control modulates from hummed symphony to still air, heightening pressure. Lyrical diction voice-motivated, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but minor overwriting in opener ("ghost of a thousand leaf blowers, their symphony conducted") risks figurative muddle; rhythm varies, no loops, but elevated metaphors occasionally drift from POV lexicon in early beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Leaf blower/tunnel premise transforms grief trope into fresh sonic ingenuity; risk-taking in accumulative sound-build to haunting renunciation feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically (+0.3 for bold synthesis).</comment>
