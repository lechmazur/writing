<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's truth affliction drives contradictory impulses—swallowing the clawing truth about his fear before planting the seed—earning his light-chested change with visible cost of the empty box. Embodied emotions (trembling fingers, worried hands) and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. Girl's question forces a final, non-burning truth that tests his trait without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of routine imagery breaks with seed-planting tightening, yielding Charged Poise closure where drones' chaotic dance reconfigures stakes, costing Elias's predictable duty (empty box, engineers' disbelief). Orientation anchored early (Skybridge toll keeper post-storm). Single scene/shards fit defaults; riddle → seed → revival traces motivated ellipsis without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lightning tower constrains climb/planting choice; beehive node and copper ribs charge final erratic drone image. Sensory hierarchy (ozone, damp earth, burnt sugar ink) filters via toll-keeper POV, mirroring wilted routine vs blooming chaos. Details evolve causally (warm ribs post-storm, dark hive to thrum).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder) signaled early via riddle/box; planting deepens under Accumulative lens with agency narrowing routine options, costing foreclosed predictability felt in light chest and dancing drones. One tightening suffices; child's gasp tests commitment without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Wonder-as-theme emerges organically from riddle solution and drone pattern break, reweighting routine premise in final image of possibility-tasting air without moralizing. Subtext in truthful renunciation layers complexity; child's grin offers resonant, non-literal answer to city's forgotten gaze.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (notices unbidden truths, gridless drones); prose rhythm modulates from humming tension to jagged release. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual—girl's question evokes Elias's light truth. No head-hopping; diction biased toward tactile relics (lacquer edges).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "words spilled... raw as honey" advances voice/stakes); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffold. Minor figurative density in opening (tuning fork, bark hands) purposeful, not muddling peak seed-plant. Clean syntax propels to charged final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of truthful toll keeper, wonder-seed relic, and grid-defying drones transforms routine dystopia into wild invitation. Riddle mechanics and blackout invitation feel inevitable; risk in cryptic prophecy heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
