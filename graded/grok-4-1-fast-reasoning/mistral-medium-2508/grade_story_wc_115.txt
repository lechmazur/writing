<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's skepticism clashes with the wheel's rebuttal weight, shown in pulse jump and ear-to-metal choice, earning his final carry of truth; contradictory impulses act in scene with embodied cost. No safety-hedging; flaws drive tunnel entry despite doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density buildup to CR closure: wheel-turn geyser reveals Luz, reweighting truth with lighter wheel and "his [shift] had just begun." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost legible in exhaled secret and carried burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tunnel sump and wheel constrain climax choice, charging final image as rosary; sensory hierarchy (wet wool, click-click, damp exhale) filters via Elias's priorities, evolving with water ripple. Micro-setting (wheel's pitted jaw) mirrors internal panic without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (swallowed truth's weight) tightens accumulatively via radio static to water movement, forcing wheel-turn agency; cost unmistakable in vision of Luz and foreclosed skepticism. One decisive deepening suffices, visible in lighter wheel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of carried truths emerges implicitly via thread/swallow motif shifting to wheel-as-rosary in final hush; resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing—"Some truths weren’t meant to be swallowed whole. Some were meant to be carried."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature: skeptical synesthesia (scent as burnt sugar rot, weight as panic-absorbed). Rhythmic modulation peaks in "drowsy, alert second"; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (short punchy stress sentences amid long sensory); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figs—coherent metaphors like "ribs of rusted track" integrate action. Propulsion peaks flawless in geyser beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: psychic radio + swallowed spool ghost + valve exorcism transforms ghost tropes via specific weight motif; risk of drowsy supernatural tone heightens inevitability of carried-truth CR.</comment>
