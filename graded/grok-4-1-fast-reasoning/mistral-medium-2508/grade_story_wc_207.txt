<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied psychometry ("rock answered in fragments: a man’s gasp") reveals contradictory fear of unanswered explanations; final renunciation earned via father's voice at threshold, foreclosing delving path with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds as compass thrum → psychometry fragments → arch touch → chamber exhale tightens to CR closure; "shape of its absence" lands on-page with conceptual cost of silenced pursuit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lagoon's "water rushed upward in a reverse waterfall" and "humming arches" constrain touch and charge realization; petrichor vial reprises beside compass, mirroring beginnings against endings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (explanation via compass) deepens via "compass now burning" and needle snap, forcing agency in touch/drop; cost legible in burning notes, foreclosing future delves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hinges/thresholds accumulate to reweight premise in "quiet where understanding ended"; final image of collecting silence offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature of objects "whisper[ing]" pasts; diction/rhythm hush to "exhaled" modulates pressure cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with no loops; "lantern cutting through gloom, revealing walls slick... like scattered stars" propels via varied rhythm without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Petrichor collector + psychometry to "hinged awakenings" synthesizes fresh CR on mysteries; risk in quiet stasis heightens resonant hush payoff.</comment>
