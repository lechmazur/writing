<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Reaper's motivation to shape fears from his reaped heart is concrete and intensifies through ritualistic choices like pressing spire into Leviathan; contradictory regret acts simultaneously in "He already did" amid continuation. Internal conflict embodied in hollow ribs pooling light. Final endurance earned with visible cost in heavy bones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from recordings to crystallizations to named monsters rising. Orientation anchored early in observatory dome. Closure as Charged Poise in reaper walking with tucked atlas, shadow coiling—reconfigures fears into hungry realities with regret cost legible in "he had no room left to carry it."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Observatory's cracked dome, rusted telescope, and dusk light constrain process, narrowing to scattered beams for crystallization. Recurring atlas charges final tuck into ribs. Sensory hierarchy (light absorption, frost exhale) reflects reaper's hollow priorities; evolves causally as dome cracks open.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (naming fears) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ink-lifting and monsters gaining solidity/voice. Agency in exhaling shapes and pressing fears forecloses formless state. Cost unmistakable in Leviathan's warning and reaper's lengthening shadow coiling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of naming granting power/sacrifice emerges organically from particulars like "Aphros" naming shuddering into existence. Final image of named scream as "good sound" reweights premise without moral. Resonance from fear-monster pairing, lingering ambiguity in watchful stars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-limited POV stable with reaper's perceptual signature (bones absorbing light, fears as eels/slippery). Voice texture in poetic rhythm modulates from hollow tracing to heavy walking. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("You’re not supposed to name us"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies propulsively, sentence openings diverse; high density in lines like "each photon sinking into the hollows... pooling where his heart should have been." No loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (ink unspooling, shapes singing vibrationally). Propulsion peaks in crystallization without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper myth with fear-naming cosmology, transforming tropes via wax cylinders and light-crystallized Leviathans. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening cosmic indifference stakes. Shadow's coiling edge feels non-obvious, personal vision coherent.</comment>
