<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chivalrous thief motivation intensifies compellingly from legacy recovery to broader amendment, with embodied emotions in the warm lid and final open arms; internal conflict in bold intrusion versus sacred playfulness acts simultaneously during the chess swap; Keeper's tremble and exhale reveal mutual transformation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density builds from ascent to chamber confrontation to descent, culminating in Charged Poise CR where lid's blue light and mending sky reconfigure the wrongness with felt cost of exchanged secrets; orientation anchors firmly in opening spire description; no causality breaks, one tightening via caught mid-swap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ice spire and wrong sky constrain choices (slick face yields footholds post-swap) and charge final image (spire sings, first right star); sensory hierarchy narrows to tactile warmth of lid amid violet pulse; details evolve causally from groaning spire to unraveling sky, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of legacy theft/amendment signaled early tightens accumulatively via Keeper confrontation, narrowing to mutual secret exchange with visible relational cost; agency in playful chess swap forces stance crystallization; moral calculus in leaving map to right-sky place charges closure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of amending unknown emerges organically from thief's swaps and final arms-open step, reweighting prior wrong sky via sky-mending image without moralizing; subtext in Keeper's "chance to embrace it" layers ambiguity; master's echoed laugh offers resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "breath curling in shapes that weren’t quite smoke" and rhythmic modulation under stress sustain single POV; dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("time... amended") advances plot with voice distinction; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged final cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers dancing over his chessboard" advances action/character/atmosphere); rhythmic variety in short punchy exchanges versus flowing descents; figurative language pattern-taught as voice-motivated lyricism without muddle or loops in peak swap beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic fantasy thief tale transforms tropes via secret-swapping chess and sky-amending lid; risk-taking in accumulative lyric closure heightens stakes; non-obvious map-in-knight turn feels inevitable from established amendment pattern.</comment>
