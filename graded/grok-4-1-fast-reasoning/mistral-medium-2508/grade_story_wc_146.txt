<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tuner's patience embodied in "infinitely patient" steps and fork strikes earns endurance at closure; minimal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously cap from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds resonance density to Charged Poise closure ("the scales felt even"); child's laughter line makes perpetual cost legible without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ancient archway and warming cobblestones constrain pace ("quickened his pace") and charge final image; selective senses (tremor in feet, bread scent) filter through tuner.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Archway groan tightens pressure under accumulative lens, forcing quicker steps; laughter reweights revival stake with felt cost of endless work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final "Balance... was a thing you *kept*" reconfigures revival premise non-literally from particulars; avoids moralizing via image of child's unbroken laughter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with rhythmic signature ("pulse... rhythm... metronome") mirrors stakes; stable single-POV perceptual bias on vibrations holds under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds, high density in lines like "the rhythm of his footsteps and the rhythm of the town were the same"; varied syntax propels to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh tuning-fork revival mechanic transforms ghost-town trope; accumulative rhythm risks bold lyric payoff in "child’s laughter, bright and unbroken."</comment>
