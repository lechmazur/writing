<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to understand transformation drives micro-choices like uncorking the vial and hurling bottles, rooted in her philanthropic trait and accidental orchestration; interiority embodied in "breath hitched" and "laughed, sharp and bright." Final renunciation of light for fire earns change with felt cost in empty hands. Minor abstraction in emotions slightly tempers contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from vials' Morse to prophecy shard to lava hurl, culminating in Charged Poise closure on pumice raft with conceptual cost of trading light for fire ("hands were full of ash"). Orientation anchored early (beach, volcano). One tightening via mirror reflection narrows to fulfillment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Black sand, lava-sea kiss, cave dust of salt/secrets constrain choices (tide recedes forcing run to lava); recurring shard/mirror charges final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (texture of transformation noticed). Environment evolves causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of transformation) signaled early, tightens texturally via prophecy ("trade light for fire") forcing agency in hurling vials; cost legible in shattered glass/erupting bugs and empty hands. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening. No live option foreclosed harshly impacts 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of accidental transformation emerges organically via light-to-fire trade and prophecy fulfillment, resonant in final image ("empty hands and a pocketful of coincidences") reweighting destitution. No moralizing; ambiguity in "both less and more" lingers. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature (textures, glows, hums); rhythmic modulation accelerates from hush to chorus. Purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure image. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors consistent (lava kiss, embers breath) without muddle in peak (hurling beat). Minor simile density in opening but purposeful pattern. No loops; propulsion clear to gold sand heartbeat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lightning bugs as philanthropy/prophecy fuel with volcano alchemy; risk in lyric prophecy-fulfillment transforms tropes organically. Final reconfiguration ("island hummed") inevitable from particulars. Bold poetic risks heighten stakes.</comment>
