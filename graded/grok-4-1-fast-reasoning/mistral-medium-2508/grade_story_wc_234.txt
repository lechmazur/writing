<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to capture presence roots in concrete memories (mentor's laugh, Liora's whisper), building to earned shift via contradictory impulses toward offering; Liora's pressure forces micro-choices like holding the shell to her ear. Final jump renunciation forecloses extraction paradigm with relational cost. Minor epiphanic phrasing ("he understood") slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images/reflections builds to Conceptual Repricing where shell reconfigures as key/promise, foreclosing capture with felt cost in weightless fall/heavy landing. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early (Elias at nexus with shell). No causality breaks; closure image undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ember nexus pulses tactilely (warm railing, steam vents), constraining shell's light-catch and jump; twilight veins mirror internal density shift. Shell as micro-setting charges final weave into boots/ribs. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (alchemical priorities over catalog).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture presence) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Liora's "it's what you return," narrowing to jump agency; cost legible in paradigm foreclosure and landing weight. Protagonist endurance/renunciation coheres under lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (density as returned presence) emerges organically from shell's evolution and jump image reweighting extraction premise without statement. Subtext in gestures (grip on shell, forehead press recall) invites ambiguity on capture vs. offer. Final "live in its glow" resonates non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (alchemical noticing: light distillation, whorls as equations). Dialogue subtextual ("Density isn’t mass"), distinct idioms (Liora's scientific-romantic vs. Elias's queries); rhythmic modulation heightens realization. No head-hopping, elisions purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops on "density" (e.g., "density isn’t mass... palette of resolve") in reflective beats dull propulsion slightly (-0.3); figurative density purposeful in lyric mode, pays off at closure. No scaffold; strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical lyricism (pocket-suns, shell equations) transforms trope into presence-as-return; risk in abstract jump-through-moment heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable particulars (columella curl, nexus throb) feel inevitable to CR.</comment>
