<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mechanic's motivation to prove time spills sideways drives consistent micro-choices like ignoring the AI and pulling the lever, with embodied details ("mechanically warm" hands) revealing expertise and blind spots. Internal conflict emerges subtly in self-assurance amid protocol risks, but lacks stronger simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak beats. Final endurance of his belief earns a credible shift without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as layers of anomalies (clocks slowing, specimens dreaming) build to nexus activation and K-11's "elsewhen" transition, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation anchors early (station in gas giant twilight, Elias at nexus). Cost legible in "violates at least twelve protocols" and station's groan, with persistent nexus constraint shaping the final hand-on-lever image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details like "groaning hull" and "cobalt light twisting like a school of fish" filter through mechanic's tactile priorities, constraining choices via lever and console. Atmosphere evolves causally with nexus warp, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Viewport twilight charges final image, with micro-setting (nexus) pivotal to proof.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove sideways time) signaled early tightens accumulatively via lever pull causing K-11 transition, narrowing options with destabilization pressure. Agency in adjustments forces trade-off (protocols vs. proof), with visible cost in flatline and AI warning. Escalation coheres under lens, though single decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear time emerges organically from particulars like "cellular memory replaying moments... in layers" and nexus bleed, reweighting premise in final "thrum of a universe... more than a straight line." Resonance in charged poise image avoids moralizing, inviting ambiguity on stepping through. Protagonist arc inextricable from conceptual friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (time "leaning," "spilled sideways") modulates rhythmically under stress, using fragments like "A wingbeat. Then another." Minimal dialogue natural and subtextual (AI's "not unkind" sigh vs. Elias's curt "Yeah"). No head-hopping; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm ("The lever was cold against his palm. He pulled.") propels accumulatively, no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives coherent and purposeful (sediment layers), integrated into action without muddle in peak nexus beat. Opening anchors stakes; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of xenobio dreams warping time via mechanic's nexus transforms tropes organically, with "sideways dark" flight inevitable from established observations. Bold lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Risks like protocol defiance commit fully to premise's implications.</comment>
