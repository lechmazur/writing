<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in "furiously tranquil" hands compel the seed push; final non-shaking hands earn change with inheritance cost persisting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as memory density reverses entropy, delivering resonant reconfiguration in roots erupting; cost legible in "vortex will return."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice cracks constrain kneeling/pushing; starlight pooling in climax recharges opening indifference, filtering through Liora's root-biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to save seeds tightens via vortex howl, forcing endurance agency in seed-push; cost in gasp and threading roots unmistakably on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of outwaiting inheritance emerges via entropy reversal; final "root breaking stone" reweights vortex rule non-literally with wild cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature in seed textures and ozone; rhythmic compression heightens "wound healing in reverse" without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in "roots erupted... threading into its feathers, its bones" propels climax; no loops, metaphors cohere in textural mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Entropy decrease via memory synthesizes fresh cosmic-family stakes; chick-to-sapling turn risks bold fantasy without gimmick.</comment>
