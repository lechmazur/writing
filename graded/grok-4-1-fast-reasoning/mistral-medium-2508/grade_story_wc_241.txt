<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in choosing blue light to defy father's gold ("her father would have chosen gold"), earning final leap with embodied cost (palms stinging); interiority particular via probabilistic metaphors rooted in backstory without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds via scrawls/lantern uses to CR closure ("scrawls glowed like constellations"); cost legible in stinging palms and heart rhythm contrast; orientation anchored early (library post-rain, Lila's defiance).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mica lantern constrains choices (blue/gold paths) and charges final spill ("clover-melancholy and bright"); sensory selection purposeful (burnt clover, wet paper) mirrors internal fray via "shattered hypothesis."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (responsible leap vs. rationalism) signaled early and deepens via second traverse ("let the contradictions hold her"); agency forecloses safe path with on-page cost (stinging palms reweighting kindness/debt).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of contradictions-as-seams emerges implicitly via traversals, reweighted in final image ("pulse of a world where luck wasn’t a lie"); resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, complexity in father's "stubborn certainty."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in math-tinged lyricism ("luck was just a lazy word for incomplete data"); rhythmic control modulates pressure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density propels ("rain started again, soft as a confession") with varied rhythm; figurative language purposeful, pattern-taught via fractured mica payoffs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms portal trope via probability lens ("traverse the tear where logic frayed"); risk in lyric dissolves heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from scrawl seeds.</comment>
