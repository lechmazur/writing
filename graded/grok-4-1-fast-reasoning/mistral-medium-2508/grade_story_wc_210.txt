<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene as alchemist rejects comfort yet wields memory as crucible, earning final stance shift to purposeful work; interiority concrete via embodied concentration on bottle. Flaw of stubborn isolation compounds into earned revival cost. Child's touch reveals relational blind spot without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density escalates from isolation to manifestation; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly when bottle empties and eyes open to revived cove, with conceptual cost of sustaining memory-made life legible in "work to do." Orientation anchored early in Cove ruins. Single scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sensory evolution from phosphorescent tide to cinnamon/charred meat constrains vision-holding choice and charges final dock image; recurring lanterns/docks mirror internal blueprints via tactile sand/kneeling. POV bias filters through alchemical priorities. Micro-setting (bottle/sand) shapes climax pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of conception tightens accumulatively via sensory buildup forcing concentration; agency in tightening grip on pulsing bottle forecloses resurrection path with cost of ongoing labor. Hand-touch reversal narrows to memory's stubborn there-ness. Moral calculus favors hard reimagining over solace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory-conception over false comfort emerges organically from bottle's demand and final image of bottle-into-tide/second beginning, reweighting premise without moralizing; child's "lanterns again?" implies ambiguity in ghost-reality. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with alchemical perceptual signature (e.g., "distilled moonlight," "working memory...crucible"); rhythmic modulation peaks in short, urgent sentences during manifestation. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual, child's voice distinct. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies propulsively, metaphors coherent (e.g., "blueprints," "spark") without overwriting in peak sensory beats. Final line recharges motifs via image/action. Read-aloud ear perfect, syntax embodies mental strain.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms ghost town trope via alchemical memory-conception, risking "not resurrection...second beginning" payoff that heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes, bold in ghost-weight warmth. Irreplaceable Cove particulars anchor vision.</comment>
