<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elira's motivation intensifies through embodied pain and micro-choices like wrapping the sapling despite sickness, earning her endurance with death as cost; contradictory devotion/defiance acts in scene. Tomas applies immediate pressure, his curiosity fraying to conversion. Final renunciation of elders' corner proves hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of symbiosis builds density to Charged Poise closure (Tomas weaves, pillars sigh) with her death as felt cost in "hand still warm." Orientation anchored early (temple orchard, Elira's 30 years). Single scene with taught time elision to dawn; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pillars/orchard constrain choices (sapling twists into flaws); copper wire as recurring tool charges final image (Tomas wraps wrist). Sensory hierarchy (creak/chime) reflects botanical POV; body (knees cracking) mirrors internal decay. Details evolve causally, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (remodel vs. elders/sickness) signaled early, tightens via Tomas confrontation deepening knowledge of her proof; endurance forecloses quiet death. Accumulative cadence shift reweights with her life as cost, legible in sapling's turn and legacy. Agency in persuasion and final tending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of bending respect emerges organically from wire-as-marriage and diary line "We were never meant to outlast..."; final image reconfigures tending as answer without moralizing. Subtext in Tomas' eyes/turn; ambiguity lingers in elders' miracle vs. stubbornness. Resonance from particulars, no platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature (symbiosis as lovers/roots); voice modulates rhythmically with intensity. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("teaching them to ask"); no head-hopping, diction POV-bound. Rhythmic control under death's poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax/rhythm propel accumulatively; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors (copper "warm... pliable" consistent). Strategic telling compresses backstory; final line recharges motifs cleanly. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dying botanist/heretic forging tree-stone marriage transforms tropes; risk in lyric Accumulative close (pillars sigh) heightens stakes inevitability. Non-obvious angle on legacy via living architecture; no derivative hedging.</comment>
