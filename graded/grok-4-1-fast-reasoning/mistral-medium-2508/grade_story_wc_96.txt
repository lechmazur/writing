<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied itch as contradictory impulse (leave vs mend) drives micro-choices like tin addition and violet tuck, earning relational stasis; Maren's steady hands apply crucible pressure without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from tin poems to violet promise, landing Charged Poise closure in itch quieting during Rilke reach; cost legible in foreclosed wandering.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted shelves and tin constrain rebuilding tactics and charge dawn image on "sea of books"; fogged breath, howling wind purposefully mirror internal chaos-to-bloom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of beauty-forging tightens accumulatively via violet and shared sorting, forcing endurance crystallization; hesitation lie reveals narrowing options with relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Stories were the only things worth keeping" and violet reprise offer non-literal CR to anarchy premise, reweighting via earned bloom without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Poetic perceptual signature ("moon clawed free," "silver wound") biases toward verse, stable third-close; sparse dialogue subtextual ("bloom in the dark") advances intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm to "one bloom at a time"; purposeful metaphor cluster ("vines through concrete," "fiercer than fire") charges closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Molting cicada itch ingeniously fuses vagrant flux with mending stakes, transforming prison-ruin trope via poem-hoard resistance into luminous fresh synthesis.</comment>
