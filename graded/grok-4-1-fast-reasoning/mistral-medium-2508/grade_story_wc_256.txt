<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to find connection's texture drives concrete micro-choices like pressing the lens and turning it, embodied in her grandfather's heirloom and bell-tuning history. Interiority feels particular through prismatic imagery tied to grief refraction. Final endurance as "the space between the notes" earns from prior pilgrimage setup, though lacks sharp contradictory impulses in peak hum moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from lens adjustment to hum-voice-path-bell reconfiguration. Orientation anchors early in lab and post-grid stabilization. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with lens absence and bell strike unfolding sound, cost legible in endless pilgrimage felt in "no longer searching."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lens as micro-setting constrains choices (pressed, turned) and charges final image (gone, replaced by bell). Sensory hierarchy favors auditory/tactile (hum vibrates bones, lens warms) filtered through Liora's bell-ringer bias. Walls of extinct instruments and refracted shadows evolve causally, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of connection) signaled early, tightens texturally via deepening hum-to-voice-to-path under Accumulative lens, narrowing from mimicry to becoming the between-space. Agency in inviting strikes and following path forecloses end-of-search with ongoing cost. One pressure point suffices; others at door add minimal complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of connection's texture emerges implicitly from lens-dish interplay creating "between" hum, reweighted in final bell unfold and her as space-between-notes. Resonant non-literal answer in striking bell that "didn’t travel" but filled like breath, with ambiguity of malfunction vs. truth lingering. No moralizing; particulars avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, perceptual signature via acoustic biases (overtones, echoes). Rhythm modulates from murmur to swelling hum, diction purposeful (prismatic chimes refracting grief). Minimal dialogue natural; no head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: sentences layer sensory advance (shadows pulsed; hum deepened) without loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies read-aloud, figurative coherence in light/sound motifs (shattered constellation, unfolded breath). No artifacts dull closure; propulsion peaks in path-following beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic pilgrimage in lost-sounds lab transforms silence-as-safety trope via lens-resonator between-space. Risk in lyric Accumulative drive heightens resonance without gimmick; irreplaceable "texture of connection" inflects turns organically.</comment>
