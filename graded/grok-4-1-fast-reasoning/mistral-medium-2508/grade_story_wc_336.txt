<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias's interior contradiction—silence as "hunger" to shape the unseen—fuels consistent traits and micro-choices like slicing the fruit to paint the girl, earning his final transformation with visible debt-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from seed's pulse to veil-crossing and return, landing CR closure in "By dawn, he was gone" with legible conceptual debt; orientation anchored early in parapet/orchard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Verdant parapet and waterfall veil constrain the inciting step-through and return, charging final orchard image as branches stretch wider; sensory details (mist curling, juice electric) filter through pruner's tactile bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—to preserve wonder—tightens accumulatively via veil-crossing agency, deepening with girl's fading fruit and Elias's juice-painting trade-off; cost unmistakable in "theft, a kindness with teeth."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as passage not possession emerges organically via seed/fruit motifs shifting to debt; final image of children's recognition offers non-literal resonance reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with pruner-specific perceptual signature (curves of branches, angle of cuts); lyrical rhythm modulates to charged hush at closure, dialogue sparse but subtextual ("They fade here").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm—no loops, coherent metaphors (seed "pulsed... warm as a heartbeat") propel through veil-beat; figurative language purposeful in peak without muddling closure image.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pruner-as-shaper crossing veils transforms folklore trope via tactile essence-capture; risk in quiet CR closure ("what might grow him") heightens stakes organically.</comment>
