<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's calloused fingers and fiddler instincts embody curiosity under pressure, compelling the pocket-and-play choice with visible cost of abandoning the bridge life. Minor weakness: final "He was the song now" edges toward abstract epiphany without raw contradictory impulse in the peak step-through moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (ozone, glass pulse, golden threads) builds to CR closure: road parts, pullout seals, flake dissolves—cost legible in forfeited old world ("the bridge had nothing to do with it"). Orientation anchored immediately; no shards/transitions violate scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pullout's guardrail, pines, and wet-stone air constrain choices (flake found, road ripples ahead), charging final pixel-road image; sensory hierarchy (smells of ozone/burnt sugar mirror internal shift) filters via fiddler's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dare amnesty via recount/song) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through glass visions narrowing paths; agency in lifting flake to eye forecloses prior life with felt cost in sealing pullout, though pressure leans lyric over visceral reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of self-sculpted amnesty emerges organically from particulars (pixel vignettes, thread paths, dissolving flake); final "the song was hungry" reconfigures "never" as generative cost without moralizing, reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, perceptual signature music/image-biased ("bridge wire in a storm"); rhythm modulates from contemplative to propulsive, with purposeful compression (e.g., "pixel by pixel") taught early and paying off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm/openings; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("shard of frozen twilight... mesh of impossible angles") during flake exam slightly muddles peak clarity but stays voice-motivated without loop artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fiddler lore, pixelated impossibilities, and "hungry" song-self transforms magical hitchhiker trope; risk in lyric CR ("road stretched... every choice he’d never dared") heightens stakes organically.</comment>
