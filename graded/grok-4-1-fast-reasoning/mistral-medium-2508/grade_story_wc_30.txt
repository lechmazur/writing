<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's embodied contradictions (bones lighter/sharper thoughts, ribs aching with moon) compel the choice of the two-truths crucible, earning the final self-vision in the creel with visible cost to routine.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds paradox density to Charged Poise closure in spoon's drop and creel's heavier possibilities; cost legible in "moon next waxed full, the creel would be heavier," with orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tidal atrium's fractaling glass, brackish channels, and tidepools constrain crucible choice and mirror internal paradoxes; final spoon reflection on creeping tide charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving wonder tightens texturally via creel shudder and moon-flip ache forcing acceptance of key's "almost"; agency in murmuring "Almost is a kind of arrival" forecloses solving with felt bone-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as routine-seen-sideways emerges organically from smelt paradoxes and molting skins; final "spoon’s reflection—a sliver of silver, a held breath" reweights premise without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of prismatic paradoxes and whispering pages holds close-third stability; dialogue subtext (ledger vs creel) distinguishes voices, rhythm modulates to charged final cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (liquid opals, thrumming contradictions) propels without loops or muddle; peak melting beat varies syntax for ear-test propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of paradox-smelting librarian and molting identities transforms fabulist tropes; risk of dense poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in creel-heavier closure.</comment>
