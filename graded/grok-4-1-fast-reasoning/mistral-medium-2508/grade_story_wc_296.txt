<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eldrin's guarded motivation to uncover his brother's "choosing" drives concrete micro-choices like planting the pulsing seed despite its hunger, with embodied contradiction in steady hands amid fogged breath. Interior flaws compound via blind spots (not mercy, personal vendetta), earning the final unbent flattening. Contradictory lie to the figure ("I didn’t come for you") acts in-scene, fulfilling 9+ test without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: seed planting → vines lash → figure rises → confession digested → key pulled, with CR closure in pocketing warm key amid resuming swirl (cost: "weight of knowing pressing him flatter"). Orientation anchors early ("Eldrin knelt at the shore"). No slips; persistent constraint (lake's pull) shapes tactics to charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (rotting blossoms, tearing silk, needle-teeth maw) filters through finder’s bias, constraining choice at "water’s pull... expanding circles." Final snowflake on shoulder charges image, mirroring internal shift. Environment evolves causally (vortex stills, then hums), fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (brother's truth) signaled early tightens causally via seed agency narrowing options to digestion, with legible cost in "truth unfurled like a blade." Escalation forces stance crystallization; brother's jump reconfigures stakes without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hunger in silence/knowledge emerges organically from particulars (digested confession, withering plant, warm key), reweighting premise in final hum Eldrin pretends not to hear. Resonant CR answers "some truths better frozen" non-literally via orchard whispers dying yet lake resuming. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "silence... another kind of hunger."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited third focalizes Eldrin's perceptual signature ("swirls formed perfect... circles"), with rhythmic modulation (short peak sentences in vine strike). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("You found me"); no head-hopping, distinct texture holds under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "vines lashing like whips, splitting... tearing silk" layers sense/action); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts. Metaphors cohere (wound, hunger, frozen) without muddle in climax. Closure image crisp: "key burned against his thigh."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms druid tropes via seed-digested confession yielding key/choices, with non-obvious moral calculus (unearth vs. let bleed). Risky charged poise ending heightens stakes; inevitable in hindsight from "finder" arc. Bold voice integrates fantasy organically.</comment>
