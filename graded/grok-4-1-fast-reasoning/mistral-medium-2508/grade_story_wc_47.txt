<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and micro-choices like pressing moss into Javier's palm reveal contradictory impulses (bravery as unflinching vs. sharp laugh); final pendant exchange feels earned with relational cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("graft new meaning") borders therapy-speak but stays embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build to Charged Poise closure in pendant exchange and moss planting, with felt emotional cost legible in "What about you?" line; single scene anchors early, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Moss-draped server racks and icicle patterns constrain choices (planting site) and charge final image of "patterns...carving new paths"; selective sensory details (moss scent, drip sound) mirror internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of post-confession healing tightens via Javier's arrival and shared planting, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens; cost felt in pendant forfeiture and vulnerability exposure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wounds-as-soil emerges organically from moss/pendant motifs shifting meaning at end ("They felt like soil"); resonant final image reweights confession without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Lena's pattern-tracing and moss-rolling; dialogue subtextual ("Plant it") advances stakes; rhythmic prose modulates with quiet intensity, stable third-close POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds; figurative language consistent (e.g., "cathedral of moss") without muddling peak beats like planting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of viral confession, moss-garden data center, and pendant rite transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes inevitably toward growth image.</comment>
