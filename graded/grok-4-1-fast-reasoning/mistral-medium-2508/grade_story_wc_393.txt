<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via trembling fingers and embodied regrets; contradictory impulses (swallowed apologies vs. penning letters) act in scene, earning final choice with cost of facing the storm. Micro-choices reveal values hierarchy. Minor therapy-speak edge in "mercy isn’t a currency" but anchored in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from winding heart to installing in box to posting letter, culminating in Charged Poise RR where tools are picked up amid glistening world. Orientation anchored early (shop, Elias, heart). Cost legible in soaked sleeves and "work" renunciation of waiting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stained-glass light, cobblestones, storm constrain choices (soldering indoors, carrying box out) and charge final image (world "wet and new"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (hymns, lavender). Shop as micro-setting enables repair-as-metaphor without postcard stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (build mercy via action) signaled early, tightens accumulatively when hymn triggers letter-writing, narrowing to endurance in storm. Agency in soldering/writing forecloses passivity with soaked cost. No reversal needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme (mercy built, apologies to action) emerges from heart's mechanism and letters, resonant in final tools pickup reweighting regrets without moral state. Subtext in hymn/light images shifts meaning organically. Borders thematic echo in "deserve the dawn" but particulars carry it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (mechanisms as confessions, light through cracks); rhythmic modulation swells with music, compresses in storm. Voice lyrical yet controlled, no head-hopping. Past quotes distinct/natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring mechanism's sigh; metaphors consistent (gears/whispers). Minor overwrite in "gold and violet pooling" pooling visuals, no loops touching closure. Read-aloud rhythm purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwork heart from prison scrap transforms redemption trope via repair-shop crucible. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
