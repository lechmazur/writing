<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in wife's vanishing voice intensifies through ritual choices, culminating in earned persistence at "Even if it killed him"; contradictory impulses surface in momentary gasp amid horror vision. Minor summary in early reflection block dilutes some embodiment without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to chamber climax with stone dissolving as pattern break; CR closure lands decisively in final image of emptied pockets and stirred dark, cost felt in suspected death. Orientation anchored early at docks; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Chamber crystals constrain ritual at "where the pull was strongest," charging closure via crumbled ash; whale skeleton mirrors forgetting, sensory selection (ozone/pennies) reflects urgency. Spatial choreography coherent from docks to chamber.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to exhume memories tightens texturally in chamber vortex/tilt; agency in pressing flowers forecloses naive recovery with horror cost, persistence crystallizes stance under gravity hunger. One deepening suffices, cost legible in shaken stone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memories as stored/taken emerges organically from gravity pulls, reweighted non-literally in CR "something stirred"; final image offers resonant answer without moralizing, complexity in futile pursuit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in gravity tugs ("lurched, as if... taken a breath"); rhythmic modulation heightens chamber pressure, diction biased to patterns/pulls. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "stone... weighed more some nights"); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or scaffolds; no figurative muddle in peak "tearing paper" beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenious gravity pockets storing memories transforms loss tropes through lived rituals; risk in surreal chamber payoff feels inevitable from coffee patterns, fresh synthesis heightens stakes organically.</comment>
