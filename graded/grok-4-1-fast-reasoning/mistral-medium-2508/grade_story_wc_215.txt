<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silent beekeeper's endurance of 17-year vow roots motivation, embodied in tracing box and deliberate exhale that releases covenant without breaking silence; contradictory impulses subtle in poised acceptance vs. ghosts' pressure, earning stasis at comb reveal. Minor abstraction in "weight of unspoken things" avoids full 9+ contradiction test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solitude to ghosts' pressures, climaxing in box's wing-unfurl sound as Resonant Reconfiguration with cost of his exhale and ghosts' brief solidification; flash-forward shard legible, reconfiguring silence into renewal. Orientation anchored by ~50 words in oasis ruins; closure cost legible in fading light gaze.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid micro-setting of skeletal hives and fractured box constrains perception and charges final handprint image; sensory pressures (humming teeth ache) narrow under ghost crisis, POV-filtered through beekeeper's wind-reading gaze. Body/box as recurring "setting" forces micro-choice at seam shiver.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve unspoken covenant) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ghost pressures to box opening, narrowing silence vs. release; agency in exhale forecloses isolation with felt cost of ghosts' departure and implied personal erasure. Escalation coherent under lens, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of covenants outlasting via silence/release emerges from comb light and final raindrop/bloom, reweighting premise without moral; handprint and bee hum offer non-literal answer to surrender question, charged by particulars like golden tears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in fractured-glass readings and breath-shaped pressures; voice modulates rhythmically from serene to humming density, prose texture distinct and biased toward wind/light omens without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line layers image/pressure (e.g., "thousand wings unfurling" propels climax); rhythmic variety in short hum bursts vs. flowing descriptions, zero loops or scaffolds, metaphors coherent (breath/room, pollen/name).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost covenant in bee-wasteland frame transforms tropes via tactile pressures and mute release; risk in lyric flash-forward heightens renewal stakes, inevitable in hindsight from box seam motif.</comment>
