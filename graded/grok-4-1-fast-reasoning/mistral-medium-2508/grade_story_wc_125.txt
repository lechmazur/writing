<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in the swing and pull on the rope, earning the ladder-carving choice with burned hands as visible cost; interiority particular via texture obsession. Ethically playful trait shown early via bread-theft analogy, constraining playful yet resonant decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of rope layers and beings' thread builds to RR closure in ladder carve, with cost legible in "pockets lighter... heavier with the weight of a question"; single scene oriented early in grotto under star-sieve sky.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rope as recurring micro-setting constrains choices (tied to stalactite, snapped in resonance) and charges final ladder image; sensory hierarchy (damp clay, sage, humming pulse) reflects poet's tactile bias, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rope's impossible choice signaled early, escalates texturally via beings' luminous addition and resonance snap narrowing to ladder renunciation; agency in carving forecloses paths with burned hands and unanswered question as on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of patterns/choices emerges from rope layers and beings' weave, answered non-literally by ladder's "rungs for the prisoner... beings... himself," reweighting time's texture without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in texture/pattern diction ("fibers frayed... time itself had braided") stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation peaks in "tick—what was. tick—what could be." without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in layered unwinding sentences; figurative pattern taught early pays off without muddle, zero loops, varied rhythm enhances read-aloud in pendulum arc.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-prison poet, energy beings, and rope-ladder transforms escape trope via textural resonance; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
