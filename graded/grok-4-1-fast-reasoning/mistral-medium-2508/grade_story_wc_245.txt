<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Embodied emotion shines in tasting "salt for sorrow, copper for longing," rooting motivation in grief; final endurance of mapped loss with "quiet blaze" earns change via prior absorption, satisfying 9+ test without epiphanic shortcuts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as vibrations densify to silence then harmony; on-page RR closure at "His grief wasn’t erased; it was mapped" delivers conceptual cost of acceptance, with ring's cooling as felt price—cost proof clear in exact line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest constrains via skin-absorbed hums guiding steps; trees "listened" at stillpoint charges final image, meeting 9+ test; sensory hierarchy (vibrations over sight) reflects blind POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to map grief tightens via note trail to bone's "remember," forcing renunciation of erasure; agency in kneeling uncovers melody, but abstract cost slightly mutes visceral punch under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence/language mapping loss emerges organically from absorption to chord; final "map was in his bones" reweights premise non-literally, satisfying 9+ test with lingering ambiguity of "pause before the next note."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with tactile signature ("skin absorbed... like ink") stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from unfolding steps to charged poise, fulfilling 9+ test—no head-hopping, perceptual bias consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("unfold," "exhaled"); figurative density risks overwrite in build ("bent like light... translating into languages"), docking minor coherence slip, but no loops dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synthesis of sonic-tactile navigation transforms blindness trope into fresh "melody was his now"; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight—rare full commitment to premise.</comment>
