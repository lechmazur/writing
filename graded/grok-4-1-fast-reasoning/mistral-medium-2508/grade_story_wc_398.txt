<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solid interiority via embodied details like vines curling ankles and wine tasting of smoke/regrets; micro-choices (sketching on letter) reveal values with cost. Contradictory impulses (fire/earth mismatch) act in reflection without alternating summaries. Single-POV voice coherent/specific, but epiphany edges toward tidy rationalization at "the mismatch itself had been the point."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: letter find anchors reflection density building to CR closure ("weight...felt lighter") with emotional cost legible in final tuck/step. Orientation clear by para 2 (Lior/vineyard/post-bus). One tightening via sketching reconfigures past/present.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (crushed grapes/damp earth/smoke) filters via POV (soil sighs/vines whisper); pavilion table constrains pouring/sketching, charges final vineyard image. Details evolve (wind stirs silk) mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (process regret/loneliness) signaled early, tightens via sketching parallel-drawing that narrows to acceptance under accumulative lens. Agency in endurance/renunciation forecloses chasing Mira with felt relational cost. No reversal needed; pressure coheres quietly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (love as mismatch/storm-quiet) emerges from particulars (letter sketch/vines); final image reweights premise non-literally ("love...passing over a field"). Subtext in gestures/silences avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "unreadable" stars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (planetary orbits/vines plead); rhythmic texture modulates (long reflective sentences to crisp actions). No dialogue; diction character-bound (equations vs soil sighs). Elision of Mira fits focalizer limits.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "roots curling...pleading fingers" advances setting/character); rhythm varies read-aloud. Figurative density purposeful in lyric mode but borders overwrite in opening ("wheezed...embers"); no loops/artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: vineyard sentinel + burned letter/sketching transforms lost-love trope via elemental contrasts (fire/earth/stars). Risky lyric reflection pays off in charged poise; no derivative echoes, voice authentic.</comment>
