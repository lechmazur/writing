<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Consistent traits (decades piecing lore) compel high-stakes micro-choices like pocketing the flake and placing it in the throne; interiority concrete in "breath hitched" amid murals' warnings. Contradictory impulses (ascend vs. ground) act simultaneously in climax refusal, earning stasis with felt cost of vanishing into myths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of discoveries (murals' "sally forth, but not upward") narrows path to unmaking; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with throne melting and chamber collapse, cost legible in "weight...lifting...like a held breath finally released."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (ozone scent, humming air) filters through lore-keeper bias; orchard/waterfall constrains entry/descent choices, tree trunk enables mural reveal charging final fruit-ripening image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmake throne) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via murals' warnings forcing renunciation; agency in flake placement forecloses ascension with on-page cost of collapsing chamber and personal erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (thrones stay empty) emerges organically from particulars like shifting murals and melting throne; final whisper "Some thrones are meant to stay empty" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting ascent premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (lore-tuned noticing of ruby pulse, inscriptions) biases details selectively; rhythmic prose modulates from urgent descent to poised exit, diction controlled and voice-coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "ruby flake...throbbed as she dug" advances plot/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, coherent metaphors (throne as "lover’s invitation") propel without overwriting in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms ascension trope via underground unmaking and groundward choice; risk in quiet refusal heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early flake/mural seeds.</comment>
