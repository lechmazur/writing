<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's blithe kindness to dead/soil embodies in tender tracing of knots despite accusation ("You shouldn’t have dug"), driving earned deepening ("blithe nature not dimmed but deepened") with personal cost of complicity knowledge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each knot undone accumulates density (breath, scent, voices, vision) to CR closure where "intentions were just knots waiting to be named" reconfigures secrets with case's weight as felt cost; orientation anchors early (silo post-chess).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Silo's "iron ribs groaning," exhaling "damp earth and rust," shadows stretching constrain untangling and charge final "door... clicked shut"; marigolds/petals recur tactilely through gardener's bias, mirroring internal shifts without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel echoes) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via knot-deepening (personal scent accusation narrows blithe detachment); agency in teasing knots forecloses ignorance with "throat tightened" cost charging reset-board poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of knotted intentions emerges via unraveling particulars to resonant CR ("Intentions were just knots waiting to be named"); final chess reset/door shut non-literally answers burial vs. naming without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (roots whispering, knots breathing); rhythmic texture modulates from blithe ("stood on his toes") to deepened ("soil darkens when turned"), eliding backstory via concrete cues like Hester's scent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "knots shifted—not unraveling, but breathing" advances triple duty); varied rhythm propels without loops, metaphors coherent (no muddle in peak vision); minor figurative density taught early, charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms gardener/haunted-object tropes: sovereigns as silence-payment vision arises organically from soil/tapestry logic; risk of poetic supernaturalism heightens via tactile unspooling to inevitable CR.</comment>
