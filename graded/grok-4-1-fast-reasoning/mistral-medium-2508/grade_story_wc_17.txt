<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory legacy pull (avoidance of mother's memory vs. compelled listening) acts in scene via ear-to-door press and shaking hands; final mural sketch earns reconfiguration from chain to thread with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as negative glimpse, echo overlap, and mural alignment build density to CR closure—"It no longer whispered. It sang."—with cost in spilled confessions reconfiguring options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage constrains split paths and rustles as witness, charging final open threshold glow; damp stone pulse mirrors heartbeat stakes throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (walls dreaming of him) deepens accumulatively via personal echoes/negative alignment, agency-driven door burn and sketch foreclose avoidance with shaking hands cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Singing corridor and glowing murals offer non-literal reweighting of memory-as-legacy, emerging organically from echoes/cruelties without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct sonic/tactile perceptual signature ("pulse of the corridor like a slow, forgotten heartbeat") sustains stable third-limited POV, rhythmic control heightens pressure seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density in "negatives spilling from his fingers like confessions" advances image/emotion/closure without loops or muddle; varied rhythm propels whisper-to-song arc.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Echo cartographer premise risks surreal walls-remembering synthesis, transforming legacy haunting into choosable thread via mural completion inevitability.</comment>
