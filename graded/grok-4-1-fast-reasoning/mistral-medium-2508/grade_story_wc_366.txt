<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's reticence yields to earned micro-choices like pocketing the glass permanently and adding a stone, revealing contradictory impulses (not superstitious yet ritual-bound); final renunciation of the skiff feels compelled by prior causality with visible cost in isolation foreclosed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as messages/stones densify pattern toward Charged Poise closure ("The skiff would rot at the dock. Let it."); cost legible in "some things weren’t meant to leave," reconfiguring isolation with undeniable opportunity price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sea glass and stones as micro-settings constrain choices (pocket/return ritual shifts) and charge final image ("pulsing like a second heart"); sensory hierarchy (humming stones, warm palms) filters through Elias's observant isolation without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs. inherited safety) tightens via agency-driven deepening—he climbs, adds stone, writes—foreclosing mainland return; escalation under Accumulative lens reweights via spiral growth, with skiff's rot as visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of handed safety emerges from particulars (glass/stones/letters) without statement; final image of dual glass/blue "held breath" offers resonant reweighting, charging prior material with connection's quiet cost over solitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature ("smooth as a held breath," "hummed when the wind hit them right") biases toward tactile glow amid ache; rhythmic control modulates from precise oars to lyric hum without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric metaphors ("held note," "pulsing like a second heart") taught early, varying rhythm accelerates to closure without loops or muddle; no scaffolds, every line propels via image-embedded action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ghost-keepers transform haunted lighthouse trope into communal inheritance via bottles/stones, synthesizing ritual specificity with fresh "stack higher" agency; risk-taking lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically to inevitable poise.</comment>
