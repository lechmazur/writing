<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exemplary interiority with embodied contradiction, as in breath hitching on cloth recognition and edges sharp against thigh, earning the final pocketing choice; confidently uncertain trait constrains career reflection without labels; minor epiphanic polish at "uncertainty didn’t feel like failure" avoids full 9.5.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density tightening via cloth discovery to charged drive-away poise; on-page closure reconfigures purpose with felt emotional cost in "space between notes"; orientation anchored early in trailer amid blasts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quarry blasts echo drum/feedback, constraining reflection and charging dust-mote lighters image; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (road dust texture, gravel static); trailer/prop states evolve tactilely to final wind dispersal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant purpose stake deepens texturally via cloth link to past, narrowing to personal claim over appraisal; agency in wresting/tucking forecloses hollow career with pocketed sharpness cost; light external pressure from foreman doesn't fully test but internal coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of "after" emerges via shifting images (awkward coughs → breath as metronome → road hum); final headlights searching unknown reweights premise without moralizing; particulars like Sharpie "After" avoid platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in music metaphors (blasts as drum machine, gravel as static); stable close-3rd with bias (dust clings like shadows); foreman dialogue natural/subtextual; rhythm modulates to propulsive end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varying rhythm (short punchy blasts amid longer builds); purposeful dust/echo pattern taught early, no loops; minor metaphor pile in "wound in the earth/quarry’s echoes faded" coheres but tempers peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie detritus to quarry echo valley transforms trope via appraisal lens and cloth talisman; bold quiet poise ending risks open ambiguity profitably; truck radio as unforeseen callback feels organic.</comment>
