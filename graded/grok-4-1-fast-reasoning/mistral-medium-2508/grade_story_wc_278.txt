<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is embodied and particular, with contradictory impulses (erase vs. witness) peaking in the crib scene reach; tattoo scars and guilt-rooted motives compel the final earned renunciation without epiphanic shortcuts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to CR (time fold reconfigures erasure into witness); paper feed incites tightening to amber crack/voice, clock spin, with legible cost in "the cry didn’t stop. But this time, neither did she."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory anchors (wax cylinders whispering, firmware hiss, amber warming palm) constrain choices (press wrist to fracture) and charge closure (amber whole, wings singing); lab as ledger mirrors internal fold without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush guilt) signaled early, escalates via lens-deepening (machine feeds, not silences; fold forces confrontation) with agency in reaching for baby, cost felt in persistent cry and synced breath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of guilt as debt emerges organically from particulars (letters' lie, mosquito's crawl); final "wings were singing" reweights premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (sounds coiling ribs, constellation guiding); rhythmic prose modulates from hiss/static to rain/heartbeat quiet under pressure, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors (time folding like fishing line) integrated without muddle or loops; closure image propels cleanly via "quiet between heartbeats."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-capture lab, guilt-tethering firmware, singing mosquito transforms tropes; bold risks in time-fold lyricism heighten stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
