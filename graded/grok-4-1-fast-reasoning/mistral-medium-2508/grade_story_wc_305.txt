<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Maren's rejection of "fragile" peace for "the source," embodied in rough hands and scarred palms; final fruit-giving choice earned via grotto causality with integrated grief cost. Voice coherent and particular through internal reflections anchored to present cues.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density (scallops, cycles) tightening to CR closure in silver fruit and scalloped bandage, reweighting grief's shape with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early (grotto threshold, fig climb); no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bioluminescent moss and umbral vines constrain pivotal choice (hairpin press parts moss, vines recoil), charging final fig tree image; sensory selection POV-biased (damp earth, rough hands tactile). Micro-setting as body/object integrates perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (source beyond peace) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via voice query and shoot absorption narrowing to integrated grief; agency in plucking/dissolving forecloses fragile peace with felt scar cost charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rebirth cycle emerges organically from particulars (hairpin→shoot→fruit), final bandage scalloping offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting grief/joy without moralizing. Motif constrains closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature biased to caretaker details (tending hands, buried children); rhythm modulates with pressure, diction purposeful without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; scallop motif coherent without muddle, propels via image integration (e.g., "shoot dissolved into her veins like wine into water").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis transforms forgiveness trope via scallop spiral and silver fruit; risk in lyric compression heightens cycle stakes organically.</comment>
