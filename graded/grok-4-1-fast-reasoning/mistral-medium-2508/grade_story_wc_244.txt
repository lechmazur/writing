<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via micro-choices like fixing radio for loaves, revealing hierarchy of values; desperately jocular grin under pressure shows contradiction without therapy-speak. Final passing of rock earns change with felt cost. Minor reflective summaries slightly dilute peak interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rumor density tightens to revelation in freight car; CR closure reweights reciprocity premise with conceptual cost in "cure...in the passing." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivy-choked platforms and kudzu-sealed car constrain choices (offerings on tracks guide search); final ivy "swallowing its nameplate" charges closure image. Sensory selection POV-biased (boots crunching glass reflects logistician utility).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cure via reciprocity) signaled early, textural escalation via rumor accumulation forces stance crystallization in rock-passing; agency in trading favors narrows options with visible cost (rock relinquished). No abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Reciprocity emerges organically from trades to ledger revelation; final "not lonely...just the motion" offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting loneliness as ledger imbalance. Particulars like mitten offerings deepen ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "world ran on favors and lies"; dialogue subtextual ("reciprocity" correction pursues goal). Stable close-3rd; rhythm modulates from dawn grit to rolling poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "moon rock...catalyze things" advances plot/character/theme); varied rhythm propels. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("slow-motion earthquake") touches non-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moon rock as reciprocity catalyst transforms loneliness trope via railroad ledger; fresh synthesis inevitable in "cure...just a list of names." Risky lyric tone heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
