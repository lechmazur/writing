<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with hesitation before mailing revealing micro-choice under subtle pressure; motivation rooted in consistent traits drives name-crafting process. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal beats like the mailbox moment. Embodied emotions align with actions, but no visible cost forecloses a flawed path on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from chalk discovery to algorithmic tweaking and mailing climax. Orientation anchored early in arcade at dawn. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with legible cost in "thunk... softer than she expected, like a secret kept," reconfiguring her ongoing role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (chalk grit, breath fog, candy wrapper crinkle) filtered through POV bias constrain choices like alley mailbox access. Recurring arcade hum/bleep-bloop subtly guides low-tech tactics. Final sun glare charges image, mirroring edge-preference.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (analog identity delivery) signaled early, tightens via manual code tweak to Mizuho and mailing hesitation under Accumulative lens. One deepening narrows options with felt cost in envelope release. Pressure coheres without reversal overload; stakes viscerally tied to meaning-making.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unencryptable meaning in margins emerges organically from chalk, rice paper, and final reflection. Subtext in low-tech persistence invites ambiguity without confusion. Final image ("edges of things... where the meaning was") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (pauses between pixels, smudges as security). Rhythmic diction modulates beautifully with intensity, prose texture character-specific. No dialogue or head-hopping; elisions purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; sentences propel accumulatively. Minor figurative density ("neon ghosts flickering like half-remembered dreams") coherent without muddle in peak beats. Propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of futuristic arcade with analog pseudonym craft transforms tropes organically. Name-creation process (Mizuho layering) feels inevitable from particulars. Risks bold low-tech in high-tech world heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
