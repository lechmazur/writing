<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion in phobia-tied micro-choices like tracing the cast "like stunt diagrams," revealing adaptive traits under pressure; final renunciation of shadow identity earned via causal buildup. Minor slip in tidy epiphany phrasing at close slightly undercuts contradiction depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore links: footsteps to girl, cast to shell voice to ledger; orientation anchored early in library/shelf moment. Closure DC via ledger discovery with blood cost legible in "bead of blood welled"; one tightening via cast decrypt suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rusted library details like "groaned beneath... sagging like old bones" constrain choices (ladder groan) and charge final exit under stars; sensory hierarchy narrows to creaks/pulses under crisis. Recurring shell as micro-setting pulses with action, mirroring internal erasure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove identity post-betrayal) tightens causally via cast/shell to ledger, narrowing options with agency in bleeding/climbing; cost felt in phobia "worse than drowning." Protagonist-driven escalation forecloses erasure path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-as-strength emerges organically from phobia, betrayal, shell/ledger arc; final "fear... current you learned to ride" reconfigures premise non-literally via image. No moralizing, ambiguity in girl's knowing eyes lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (stunt lens on cast); dialogue natural/subtextual ("You gonna let him win?") advances goal. Voice texture rhythmic, modulates tension without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in short, punchy crisis sentences; metaphors coherent (shell "biting... warning") integrated into action. Minor density slip in opening descriptive run, but no loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of stunt double betrayal with seashell/cast decrypt transforms tropes; child's smudged message as key turn feels inevitable from adaptive traits. Fresh risk in magical realism logic cohering causally.</comment>
