<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory fear of shadow edges versus unraveling the cloak earns the final endurance of uncertainty with embodied cost (trembling fingers dissolving threads). Internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene via shard's hiss and chime signals. Woman's arrival forces relational micro-choice without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of whispers, chimes, unraveling reconfigures certainty to pulse-beam Charged Poise. Orientation anchors by para 2 (lighthouse steps, keeper routine). Closure cost legible in "dust settle" and flickering beam foreclosing polished command.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Breezy lighthouse constrains: chimes dictate "Change," tide exposes cloak for pivotal unravelling. Sensory hierarchy (wind howls narrowing to raw voice) charges final soft dawn image. Recurring shard/beam as micro-setting reweights premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shed borrowed doubts for nuance) signaled early via shard; density escalates through frantic chimes to unhooked threads narrowing options. Agency in kneeling/unravelling bears visible cost (hitched breath, trembling). Final woman's pact crystallizes trade-off under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of nuance over certainty emerges via shifting images (cloak to quilt, beam to pulse/question); final "light begins... learning its shape" non-literally reweights without moralizing. Particulars (chimes laugh doubt) resist tidy binaries. CR cost in sacred heaviness undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (chime patterns as tea leaves, fog-cracks doubt) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates tension (short hisses to sighing chimes). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("help you carry yours"). Patterned elision taught early, paid in hollow shard reprise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "shard hummed... sincerely insincere" advances voice/plot/atmosphere). Varied rhythm propels without loops; figurative cluster purposeful in build-up, coherent at peak unravelling. No scaffold obscures closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: conscience-keeper's audible shard/cloak transforms guilt tropes into textured doubt-weaving; wind-chimes as oracle risks lyric boldness heightening stakes. Irreplaceable turn: unhooked fisherman's remorse recharges premise organically.</comment>
