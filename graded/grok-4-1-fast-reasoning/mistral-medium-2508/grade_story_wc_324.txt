<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied ("breath came shallow, as it always did when the dead called"), with curiosity as persistent flaw driving reckless entry and final commitment; contradictory impulses (not a hero vs. listens too closely) act in scene, earning personal revelation ("It was *his*") without epiphany dump.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (mist, static, pulse) builds to CR closure with legible cost ("knees hit the stone... photograph warm against his chest"); orientation anchored early (atrium, twilight); single scene dissolves purposefully without causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mist as micro-setting constrains choices (swirls shapes, guides to bench, screams on glove touch) and charges final image ("mist was gone"); sensory hierarchy sharpens under pressure (iron taste, pressure not sound), integrated via POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find her before mist) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening (whisper to scream to laughter), driven by agency (adjusts frequency, picks glove); cost unmistakable in personal reconfiguration ("now... leading *him*").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing as salvation emerges organically from listening job to dead's plea ("Remember us"), resonant CR in final image ("He answered") reweighting echoes without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature ("air thick... like pennies left on a corpse’s eyes"); rhythm modulates hush to pressure, diction biased (static as spider silk); hearing aid "whispers" natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring intensity (short fragmented peak: "He stumbled... world went silent"); figurative coherence (mist screams as pressure) without muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of heart-tracing job into supernatural echoes with personal twist ("child’s face... *his*"); transforms ghost trope via occupational lens and incidental pull, risk-taking in CR payoff feels inevitable.</comment>
