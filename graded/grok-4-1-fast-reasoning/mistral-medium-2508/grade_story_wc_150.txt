<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation roots clearly in belief in roots over miracles, embodied in methodical digging and seed-planting micro-choices that earn his final laugh and deeper commitment. Contradictory impulses—disbelief vs. following pulses—act simultaneously, culminating in a credible shift without epiphany. No on-page relationships to test, but solo interiority sustains pressure perfectly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (seed, mural, sapling) build density toward RR closure in "sapling split the stone," reconfiguring faith with felt cost of solitude endured. Orientation anchors immediately in valley/catacombs; single scene over days fits scope with no shards. Cost legible in "stone cracked" and trembling roots.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Catacomb setting constrains via pulsing roots guiding choices; sensory details (figs, warmth) filter through Elias's priorities, charging final sapling image. Micro-setting of bones/roots mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism. 9+ gate met: roots as recurring object shape tactics and end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore orchard/faith) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening discoveries narrowing doubt to charged poise at sapling emergence. Agency in planting/following forces trade-off of isolation for potential; cost felt in raw laugh amid trembling roots. One tightening sufficient, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of rebuilding interrupted faith emerges organically from particulars (roots in bones, seed in hand) to resonant end: "Some things...not meant to stay buried" reweights premise without moralizing. Final orchard stirring answers central question non-literally; ambiguity in miracle vs. roots lingers honestly. 9+ test: reconfigures priors with cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (noticing pulses, warmth as exhaling trees); rhythmic prose modulates from methodical to incantatory at "sapling...gilded by dawn." No dialogue; elision of villagers purposeful. Distinct texture biases toward roots/earth, heightening pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines like "roots...pulsed faintly, as if breathing" advance multiple layers without loops. Varied rhythm propels from excavation to climax; no artifacts dull closure's "roots trembled in response." Read-aloud ear clean, purposeful lyricism taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms buried saints/orchard trope via roots cradling bones and sundial-seed mechanic into fresh synthesis of faith as roots. Risk in accumulative lyric build pays off inevitably at cracking stone; no derivative echoes, fully committed premise.</comment>
