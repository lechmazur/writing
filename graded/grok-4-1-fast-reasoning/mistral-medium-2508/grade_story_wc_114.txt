<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the decision beat ("She could warn them... Or she could let the storm come"), earning the renunciation with embodied cost (trembling hands, lodged pebble dissolving). Interiority particular and degraded under stress without labels. Final choice forecloses warning path scalably.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to Charged Poise/CR closure where stepping into storm reconfigures certainties with conceptual cost ("The weight in her ribs dissolved... footprints vanished"). Orientation anchored early; no breaks, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (barometer dip, wind shift forcing decision); recurring illustration charges final image (held to light as "wings," set center table). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (ozone/blood smell oracular). Weather evolves causally, mirroring internals without overtness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (speak truth vs. silence) signaled early, textural escalation via fever clarity and ozone cue narrows to renunciation agency; cost legible in station's loss/her vanishing. One deepening suffices, pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of swaying certainties emerges organically from particulars (smudged petals as question mark, margins breathing); final image ("footprints vanished... swallowed whole") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual signature ("air smelled like ozone and old blood," "truths heavy to swallow/regurgitate"); syntax/rhythm modulate with intensity, stable close third-person. No elision issues; prose embodies oracle mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to closure without loops or scaffolds; figurative language purposeful (e.g., "unspool itself," "peel back") and pattern-paid in wings image. No artifacts dull peak; read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh oracle/weather station synthesis transforms trope via margins/mysticism blend; risky lyric CR ("ravens... aurora’s sorrowful glow") inevitable from particulars, heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
