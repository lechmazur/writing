<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied details like the tooth warming against her skin and teeth aching from warped echoes; Liora's modest fearlessness and realization of integration need reveal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the petal-scattering beat, but final choice earns closure via prior soul pursuit. Minor reflection on mother anchors concretely without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from pursuit to choral laughter; orientation anchors gorge/collector/dawn by paragraph 2; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration via harmonized notes and lighter satchel lands on-page with felt emotional cost in the "whole" melody that lingers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (mist curling, damp stone, wet earth) filters through Liora's priorities, constraining choices like plucking strings; recurring harp and tooth charge final image where glinting tooth and carried note reconfigure gorge from conspiratorial to healed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of soul integration tightens via realization ("You want to be laughed with") and joke exchange under textural lens, forcing agency in petal scatter and punchline; cost legible in foreclosed release path, though one deepening suffices but lacks micro-turn reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of joy-weaving into grief emerges organically from particulars like broken laughter to chorus, reweighting collector role; final image of "luminous and gentle" ache offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing, embracing ambiguity in lingering distortion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (souls as burrs, vibrations against bone); dialogue subtext-heavy and goal-driven ("Tell me something funny"), distinguishing voices; rhythmic modulation peaks in choral laughter without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (e.g., "cracked harp string" echoes distortion), but minor overwriting in opening mist/cliffs metaphors slightly dulls early propulsion; no loops, clean syntax varies for ear, closure image propels crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms spectral haunt into laughter-integration via crocodile joke tying tooth/mother; risk-taking in lyric textural drive heightens stakes, with irreplaceable gorge-harp logic feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
