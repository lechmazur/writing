<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Esoteric realist traits drive consistent motivation to build knowing impermanence, with embodied contradiction in hands moving "without thought, the motions practiced but never perfunctory"; final endurance in gathering materials earned by prior micro-choices under transience pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of imagery building to cadence shift at unraveling; on-page CR closure in "gathering new materials" reconfigures remembering as endless with cost of scattering legible in spiral's fraying; orientation anchored early in grotto details.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto's moss, wind gusts, and clouds constrain building and charge final image of unraveling; sensory hierarchy (damp earth scent, wing warmth) filtered through Lior's noticing biases; environment evolves causally with gust swaying spiral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honoring migration tightens via spiral's mimicry then dissolution under Accumulative lens; agency in endurance forecloses permanence with felt cost in "wing had gone first, carried off"; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transient truth emerges organically from wing/spiral images shifting to endless remembering; final image non-literally answers oversight question via "wind was always hungry for signals" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature in "cataloged the weight of wind"; rhythmic modulation peaks in gust moment; purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops; figurative language purposeful in "fading stitch across the sky" without muddle; propulsion aligns with scene's quiet escalation to unraveling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of butterfly loss via wind-readable signals transforms trope of grief; risk in lyric stasis heightens stakes of noticing; inevitable hindsight from early wing to final gathering.</comment>
