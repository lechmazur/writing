<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when Veyra tightens her grip on the pulsing diamond despite the tremor and scattering starlings, earning her fatal endurance through inherited hunger shown in copper veins burning then freezing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as echo density escalates from passive reflections to alive clawing, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure in the cracked diamond and Veyra's translated whisper ("You were never meant to understand"), with cost in her becoming the undying echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Bone towers constrain climax by groaning then singing to chain her, while starling patterns and diamond fog charge the final reconfiguration image of the canyon breathing without its storyteller.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake to harness dying language tightens texturally when passive echoes coalesce into the shattered name, forcing Veyra's agency to continue with legible cost in echoes wrapping ankles and towers singing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of unharnessable echoes emerges implicitly through texture-to-sound pursuit shattering into "the sound of a language dying across the death of its last translator," reweighting revival as curse without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV sustains perceptual signature in sound textures ("grit of consonants," "silk of vowels"), with rhythmic compression heightening pressure as echoes live, no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful repetition (echoes, patterns taught early), climax free of muddle; "The canyon inhale" image reads aloud with charged cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synthesizes copper-vein inheritance, bird-cipher translation, and answering-curse diamond into inevitable tragedy, transforming folklore tropes via textural horror without retreat.</comment>
