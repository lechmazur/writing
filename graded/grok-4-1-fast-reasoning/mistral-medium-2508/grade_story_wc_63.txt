<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias's silent atonement clashing with village lies, embodied in hovering fingers and carved self-name; final endurance to carve next name earned via accumulated regrets. Contradictory impulses act in scene as he presses rake despite barring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as regret density builds to Charged Poise closure in "Elias smiled. Then he reached for his knife and began to carve the next name," with cost in splintered rake and foreseen outrage; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ridge and tower constrain via barring and sanctuary pause, charging final silhouette; "sea below gnawing at its roots" mirrors internal erosion, tactile in salt-spray veins and kelp gust.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of balance via weighted chime tightens when rake presses bob, slowing descent and forcing village glance; cost legible in "splintered further as he tucked it back," altering his palm and resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Incremental absolution reweights regrets through names-as-weights motif, resonating in village pauses without statement; final carving offers non-literal answer to silence's toll.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual bias toward time's hush and carved debts; rhythmic control peaks in "The pendulum completed its arc. The tower chimed," modulating reverie under pause pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with no loops, propulsion in varied syntax like "The names weren’t prayers. They were weights."; figurative coherence in tide/weight images enhances without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Carving regrets into rake to weight pendulum transforms clock-tower trope into fresh absolution engine; risk in ethical defiance heightens stakes organically.</comment>
