<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's tremble at the woman's face from dreams reveals contradictory impulses between duty and desire, earning the final step onto the bridge with personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from measurements to personal vow recognition; closure RR lands in bridge crossing as library dissolves, reconfiguring stakes with felt loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen library's collapsing shelves constrain pace and charge final dissolution; slide's warmth and prism constrain choices, evolving tactilely to guide bridge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to extract meaning tightens via woman's voice invitation, forcing agency to pursue over preservation; cost legible in uncharted frequency spike and library's end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of vows as invitations emerges implicitly; final "light bent" reweights measuring as path to fulfillment without moralizing.</comment>
