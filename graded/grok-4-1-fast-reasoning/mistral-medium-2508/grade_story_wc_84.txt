<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied interiority peaks in "knew that hunger—the need to decode," tying micro-choices like drone theft to relational arc; final hand-take earns change with cost of shared vulnerability, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via image density to Charged Poise closure in constellation/hand-hold with legible emotional cost; drone pull causally unlocks seam, tightening options without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dusk-aligned star trails on walls constrain drone path and enable chip slot reveal, charging final oculus star image; sensory selection (tremor, fogged breath) reflects Lena's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant belonging stake signaled in "gaps in the world"; drone pull tightens via pilgrim lunge, forcing shared revelation with foreclosed isolation cost, driven by Lena's agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Missing pieces motif shifts from chip/lock absence to relational space, offering non-literal answer in etched shadows; resonance emerges organically without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable Lena-limited POV with signature for distortions ("gaps... screaming"); rhythmic modulation builds to closure poise, elisions taught early via drone feed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (e.g., "servos whirring like a held breath" propels); varied rhythm and purposeful refrain ("brilliant dimness") enhance propulsion without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drone-mediated quest transforms ancient-tech trope into fresh relational CR; bold textural synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via dusk constraint.</comment>
