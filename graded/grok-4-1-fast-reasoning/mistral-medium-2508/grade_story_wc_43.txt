<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in the vinyl shard biting to sustain "decisively kind" despite betrayal-feeling kindness; final release earned through patient connection. Interiority particular via sensory anchors like crushed lavender. Flawless micro-choices under goodbye pressure reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of scents/music builds to Charged Poise RR in shard drop, reconfiguring release with felt emotional cost legible in "hollow of her own palms." Orientation anchored early (haven, therapist role). Single scene causality intact, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring scents (lavender, chamomile, rain on pavement) and micro-objects (harp, shard, teacup) constrain choices and charge final image; "radiant haven above clouds" mirrors internal release. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward hope-as-scent. Body/setting lived-in via plucking, scraping chair.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye post-bloodwork) signaled early, tightens texturally via music connection narrowing to honored release; agency in playing despite protest forecloses denial path. Cost felt in patient's hitch, Lena's staying. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (hope in goodbye, not cure) emerges organically from mundane hymning reunifying life; final shard drop/shadowed moon reweights "time that was" without moralizing. Subtext in silence post-song, irony of "flawless" amid death. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature (hope scents, hymn echoes); POV stable, single focalizer. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("hell of a hymn"), advances via laugh/hitch. Rhythm modulates pressure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm/syntax mirroring emotional cadence; metaphors coherent (hope-scent, clouds parting). Minor overwriting in figurative density during peak (song beat) dings slightly, but voice-taught and closure clear. No loops/artifacts touching end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cloud-haven therapist wielding shard/music transforms hospice trope into scent/texture-driven release; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes. Non-obvious "hymning the mundane" turn inevitable from particulars. No derivative echoes.</comment>
