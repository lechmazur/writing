<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic interiority embodied in "nerves singing as the colors coiled around her wrists" reveals contradictory impulses (tame vs. unfetter) driving micro-choices; final joining of world earned by chime progression with heresy cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as chimes densify aurora response; Charged Poise closure in "Liora stepped forward... she did not translate... She joined it," with legible cost in crumbling sheet and thawed ground reconfiguring silence-to-voice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice cavern constrains via rebounding fractals and groaning walls melting with second chime; evolves purposefully, charging final thawing ground where "bare feet pressing into the thawing ground."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tame chaos vs. unfetter wonder) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through chimes narrowing elder control; agency in strikes forecloses tame path with on-page cost of dissolved frost and heresy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silence-as-cage theme emerges organically from hush-breaking chimes to aurora's conversation; final image of child gasping and sculptor listening offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting fear-to-wonder without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("tone not heard but seen") biases noticing uniquely; rhythmic control modulates from misted breath to pulsing invitation, stable third-person limited POV throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density in lines like "bridges of light connecting the cavern’s stalactites to the sky" propels without loops; varied rhythm and purposeful figures enhance pressure, zero artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synesthetic aurora-unfettereing tied to sculptor's mythic chisel transforms mythic tropes into fresh premise; bold lyric risks heighten inevitability of final invitation without gimmickry.</comment>
