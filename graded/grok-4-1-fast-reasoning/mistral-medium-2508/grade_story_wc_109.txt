<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in obsession with silences drives endurance to dissolution, embodied in "fingers tracing the flaking gold leaf"; minor slip in absent simultaneous contradictory impulses during retelling, but micro-choices like page-turning reveal values under self-erasure pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silence density builds to CR closure in "the map was not in the recording but in the erasure," with conceptual cost of self-dissolution legible in booklet's fall and Eldrin becoming "another layer of quiet."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ridge fort's pocked walls and stone constrain via echoed vigil ("pressed his palm to the stone"), charging final image; sensory hierarchy (wet stone, iron scent) selective through oracle's perceptual bias, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to map night signaled early tightens texturally via star's extinction forcing erasure realization; agency in booklet release forecloses prior path with felt cost of identity loss, one decisive cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as map/weight emerges organically from particulars like "silences he had collected," resonant CR ending reweights premise without moralizing—"the night already knew its shape."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in silence-noticing ("weight of silences," "ripple in the stillness") biases details character-specifically; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, POV stable single-focalizer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "gold leaf flaked onto his lap like gilded snow" advances object/atmosphere); minor template cadence in repeated "silence of [X]" phrasing (-0.4), but pattern-taught lyric propulsion intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle hoarding silences as coordinates transforms trope organically; risk-taking in full dissolution payoff feels inevitable from erasure motif, heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick.</comment>
