<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Awkward confidence shines in the raw laugh and shouting over din, compelling her to share glasses despite risks; embodied toes curling in grit grounds her, but epiphany on rebellion's "why" leans toward unearned summary in reflective blocks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory buildup from sigh to roaring hum, yielding Charged Poise closure as bay reignites with ships lifting; orientation anchors firmly by para 2; cost felt in "stubborn, thunderous act" refusing silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Spaceport bay's rusted girders and cracked concrete tactilely pressure barefoot navigation; stones' shifting spirals constrain palm-press inciting incident, charging final ship shadow; selective sensory hierarchy matches Lena's desperate scanning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lull stake signaled early tightens via hum surge narrowing to shared ignition; Lena's palm-press and glass-passage agency forecloses silence with felt cost in "mess had always been the point"; one decisive density increase suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of meaning in wreckage emerges organically from stones "remembering" amid debris, resonating in final hum-as-name image without moralizing; counter-reading of rebellion's futility lingers via stalled slogans.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias (dust motes, warm brass) stable in close third; diction modulates from chill fog to pulsing roar under stress; scout dialogue minimal but goal-driven, advancing ignition without info-dump.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied openings and building hum echoes without loops; high density in "fractals of gold and violet" integrates image/action; minor figurative density in peak stones roar risks slight overwrite but pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi rebellion with ancient megalith hum as rebellion's "ember"; barefoot stargazer trope transformed via tactile debris and glasses' flare into communal spark, risking bold lyricism without gimmick.</comment>
