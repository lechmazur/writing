<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory doubt and desire act in the narration beat ("I’m not sure... But I’m done pretending"), earning the letting-go choice with embodied cost in scars matched to pockmarks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images builds to Charged Poise closure as statue lifts amid dissolution, with key turning as legible cost-point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Acid sea's rise constrains the final step, charging the image of workshop unspooling; sensory narrowing to hisses and creaks under crisis urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of soul-mending tightens via breaths and sea breaching, forcing narration agency and step with dissolution cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of alchemist "stitching themselves into the story" non-literally answers mending-as-becoming, reweighting kintsugi premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mend/quilt diction; rhythmic shortening ("The key turned. The world held its breath.") heightens pressure cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; no loops, metaphors cohere (quilting to kintsugi) without muddle in peak dissolution beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical kintsugi in acid-sea workshop; risk of lyric fantasy pays off in transformative closure image.</comment>
