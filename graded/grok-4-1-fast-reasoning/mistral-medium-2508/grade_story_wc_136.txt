<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in precision obsession clashing with grief, embodied in shaking hands at the voice's question; final whisper "I don’t know where she went" earns closure via prior causality without tidy epiphany. Flaw of mapping as detour avoidance drives micro-choices like tracing cracks. Voice particular to analytical artist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: crack patterns build density to punch's air-tear (inciting pivot), culminating in CR closure where platform vision reconfigures mysteries as questions carried forward, cost legible in surrendered lie and dissolving punch. Orientation anchored by clocktower/midnight by para 2. Single scene coherent, no shards debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cracks as recurring micro-setting constrain path from streets to pedestal, charging final map crease image; sensory hierarchy (mist smell, fogged breath) filters through mapper's bias. Dome's lattice mirrors internal fractures purposefully. No generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (name unspoken truth to cross threshold) signaled early, tightens via punch's tremble to voice's demand, forcing agency in whisper that forecloses denial path with emotional cost. Accumulative escalation via symbol density reweights options; sister's appearance complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truths as named cracks emerges organically from pavement arrows to map crease, offering non-literal resonant answer in "some mysteries weren’t meant to be solved, only carried"; CR reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in silent punch impression layers ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (currents beneath streets, arrow cracks); rhythmic prose modulates to short breaths in climax. Sister's dialogue natural/subtextual: "some paths aren’t meant to be followed—only acknowledged." No head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer sense/action (e.g., "The tool trembled, then *bit*—not into paper, but into the air itself"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density (mist/parting) purposeful under taught pattern, no muddle in peak voice query.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapper charting unseen currents to phantom station of regrets transforms mystery trope; risk in surreal platform vision heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via crack motif. No template echoes.</comment>
