<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's embodied interiority (fogging lens, feather brush) and micro-choices (watching jellyfirefly on Kael's wrist) earn the hand-holding pivot and final endurance below with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup to Charged Poise closure in parting (Kael surfaces, Elara tucks feather), reconfiguring water's weight as embrace with felt separation cost pinpointed in "didn't need to follow."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant belonging stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via Kael's arrival and shared exhale, foreclosing isolation with legible parting cost under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of feather/logbook and surface echo reweights home-as-frequency premise resonantly without statement, emerging from light patterns and connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (constellations in algae, Morse-code jellyfish) stable in Elara's POV; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("You ever see...").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion strong with varied syntax, but metaphor density in respite peak ("held breath finally released") borders overwriting without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drowned astrologer reading stellar patterns in abyss glow transforms post-flood tropes, with feather/jellyfirefly inflections heightening stakes organically.</comment>
