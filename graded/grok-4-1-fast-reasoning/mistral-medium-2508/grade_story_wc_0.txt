<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation as neutron star researcher compellingly extends to orchids via decay analogies, with earned shift from forcing blooms to witnessing shown in sabbatical email; interiority concrete and embodied in soil-kneeling and vial-handling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern density building from dust sprinkling to root tracery revelation; orientation anchored in opening greenhouse image; CR closure via "Theory of Kindled Humility" reconfigures control illusion with felt cost of lost orchids/routine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Storm-damaged greenhouse vividly pressures observation via jagged panes and rotting compost mirroring internal decay mapping; recurring vial constrains choices and charges final relic image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping absence tightens accumulatively via week-long returns and palm-shift recognition, narrowing from revival illusion to endurance; cost legible in evaporated floodwater and empty vial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of gradual change over forced drama emerges organically from dust patterns and flood stripping, resonating in final notebook equation without moralizing; vial reprise reweights premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in prismatic/star analogies; rhythmic modulation builds to soft-math closure; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High figurative density borders overwriting in reflective beats (e.g., "ribs bare, broken teeth"), dulling propulsion slightly; no loops but paraphrase in decay descriptions; strong rhythm overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics, butterfly dust, and floral decay transforms tropes of loss into "Kindled Humility" theory; risk in lyric accumulation pays off at equation image.</comment>
