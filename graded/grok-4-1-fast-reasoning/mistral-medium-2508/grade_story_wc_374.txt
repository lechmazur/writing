<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's skepticism creates internal contradiction, embodied in her refusal to believe until the compass points to her reflection, compelling the micro-choice to kneel and taste the shift, earning her transformation with the cost of dissolved doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory density builds from ozone taste to "terrestrially cosmic" realization; compass needle's spin to self-reflection incites causal tightening to CR closure where ring dissolves into veins, reconfiguring her with legible cost of rewritten identity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lavender bluffs and aurora constrain choices via petals swirling wrists and moss under palm, charging final image as bluffs glow and dissolve into light beneath her step.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of measuring weather phenomena deepens via self-pointing compass and ring's burn, forcing agency in standing as wind rises; escalation accumulates textural pressure to foreclose skepticism with cost of becoming the convergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of emergent physics over magic arises organically from taste mechanics and forest vote, answered non-literally in aurora's compass rose pointing at her chest and world's tilt forward.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature of taste ("ozone," "terrestrially cosmic") and rhythmic modulation under rising intensity; diction reflects skeptic's precise sensory bias without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere around taste/weather (e.g., "hurricane in their ribs") without muddle, propelling via varied syntax to charged closure image of bluffs stepping with her.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tasting synesthesia and forest elections transforms weather-wielder trope; risk in lyric accumulation pays off as "air brushed back" inevitability heightens cosmic stakes.</comment>
