<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Steady hands pausing over tablet glyphs embody methodical grief; internal conflict of hypothesis-spirit resolves in earned dual vision of love/loss, with visible cost in non-undoing precision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens builds from deciphering to planting to on-page transition; CR closure reconfigures spirit as hypothesis with conceptual cost of perpetual bending, constraint of Arbor shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Magnetic tug on tools constrains climb and planting; warm iron branch and reversed leaves charge transition image, filtering through translator's analogical priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to grasp transition deepens accumulatively from failed glyphs to bloom-touch agency; cost unmistakable in realization of reestablishing both presence and foreseen loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Blank tablet and wife's "Always" reweight translation of grief as bridge without moral; emergent theme of bending transitions resonates from seed motif to final light change.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Analogical perceptual signature ("drop becomes river") and rhythmic modulation from metronome steadiness to world-tilt sustain close third; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and integrated metaphors (leaves dissolving into ascent); zero loops or scaffolds, peak bloom clear without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sky Arbor's inverted physics and hypothesis-spirit synthesize linguistics with fantasy transition; bold lyric risk pays off in inevitable CR without gimmickry.</comment>
