<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solid embodied interiority via trauma cues like knee locking and nerves mapping forest pulse; micro-choices like dipping fingers reveal values under pressure. Final endurance earned as hands stop shaking post-strap snap. Minor abstract epiphany ("mercy wasn’t a variable") edges from concrete without full contradiction in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from waking disorientation to shrine resonance, yielding CR closure in strap snap and golden light bend with conceptual cost of "ledger of absences." Orientation anchored early via anesthesia and forest hum. No lens ambiguity; persistent forest constraint shapes path to payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>UV forest and shrine specifics (black-leaved canopy, bruise-glow, burnt copper air) constrain via roots pulling ankles and pillars' pressure-peeling resonance, charging final exhale image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis to tactiles like slick bark/sap. Body as micro-setting (twitching fingers, locked knee) mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (processing mercy equation) signaled early via captors' demand; textural escalation peaks in basin visions and pillars singing, narrowing to stance crystallization with cost in peeled nerves and strap snap. Agency via kneeling/dipping forces trade-off. One tightening sufficient under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mercy as "spaces between numbers" emerges organically from equation unfurling and bird's silences, reweighting premise in CR without statement. Final image ("count the silences") offers non-literal resonance. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "echo."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in synesthetic notices ("teeth ache" from symbols, "harmonic resonance that peeled back his skin"). Rhythmic control modulates from jagged waves to exhaling cadence under pressure. No elision issues; voice biased by trauma.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "roots coiled around his ankles, not to trap him but to pull"); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("equation unfurled like a wound") coherent but dense in peak; no loops or artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of UV penance forest, proprioceptive mapping, and mercy-as-absence math transforms trauma trope organically. Risky lyric texture heightens stakes via resonance payoff; strap reprise inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes.</comment>
