<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong character-specific motivations via Elias's profit calculus softening into compassion, embodied in leaving the locket; internal contradiction acts in the proposition scene. Minor slip: librarian's traits shown well but secondary to Elias's arc. Final partnership choice earned with ledger cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: note → meeting → revelation → partnership (DC/RR) with legible cost in "ledger balanced a little less neatly." Orientation anchored in first paragraph (seaside library post-symphony). Single scene fits scope; no slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (salt-kissed breeze, lantern on silver hair) filter through Elias's attention; oleander anchors meet, locket charges final image. Micro-setting constrains midnight choice. POV bias shapes priorities perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (connect/partner via locket) signaled early, tightens at revelation narrowing options to shared scheme; agency in note/proposition. Cost felt in profit forfeiture implied by ledger. One decisive escalation sufficient under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cycles of compassion emerges organically from locket's return and partnership plan; final envelope image reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with distinct perceptual signature (spotting undervalued people/goods); dialogue natural/subtextual ("broker, not a saint"). Rhythmic control heightens quiet pressure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., short declarative beats in dialogue); purposeful metaphors without muddle. Minor overwriting in opening atmosphere but weaves into action; no loops/artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost locket trope with broker-librarian compassion cycle; seaside details transform into organic partnership. Risk in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
