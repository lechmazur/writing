<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions like "quiet in her own ribs" and childhood anchor tilting present choice to trace paths; final laugh earned by causal buildup of loneliness as cost. Retrocognition flaw drives inevitable isolation without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising to prism mending and beacon flare as CR; cost legible in "sharp and disbelieving" laugh reframing fractures. Orientation anchored by step 1; single scene tightens meaningfully without micro turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glass pavilion and star paths constrain tracing choice and charge final constellation mirror; sensory hush "made her teeth ache" embodies post-collapse urgency. Micro-setting (prism fractures) evolves causally to mend.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle for coincidence meaning) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ignited paths narrowing to flare; agency in kneeling/press forces trade-off of isolation. Cost felt in reframed loneliness charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of meaning in fractures emerges via particulars like prism crack mirroring rib quiet, culminating in non-literal CR: "the design in the collapse" reweights past without moral. Resonance from lived ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature biases to hums/pulses; rhythmic diction modulates from ache to song without leakage. Prose as character reflects stressed retrocog mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with lines like "silence so deep it made her teeth ache" doing triple duty; varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (light "climbed the walls like vines"). Propulsion peaks clean at flare.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocog loneliness and hush-shard transforms post-apoc tropes; risk in lyric CR ("thistle-blown moment") heightens stakes via inevitable hindsight alignment.</comment>
