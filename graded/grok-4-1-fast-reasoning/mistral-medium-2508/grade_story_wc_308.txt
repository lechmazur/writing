<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in stillness versus drawing the Maw through resonance; final endurance as anchor earned by ancestral training and anomaly detection. Interiority concrete via vibrations against sternum. No unearned epiphanies or diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from flock patterns to anomaly scatter to resonant thrum closure (RR/Charged Poise). Cost legible in "becoming its anchor" foreclosing movement. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bone towers and canyon echoes constrain stillness as survival, charging final silence. Sensory hierarchy via vibrations/resonance reflects skimmer's priorities. Final image of canyon breathing recharges setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (detect wandering pulse without moving) signaled early; tightening via anomaly narrows to predator approach under Accum lens. Agency in whispering old words forces endurance with cost in unflinching shadow. Escalation coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stillness as navigation emerges from arrowhead binding and Maw passage; final image ("He was the stone. He was the echo.") reweights particulars non-literally. No moralizing; ambiguity in flock reform lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in resonance/vibrations; rhythmic control modulates from measured exhale to terse "He didn’t flinch." Stable close third-person; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm in short peak sentences ("The skimmer didn’t flinch."). Zero loops, coherent metaphors (pulses/ripples/echoes); no overwriting in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic-reader and vibration-navigation transforms guardian trope; risk in stillness-drawing predator heightens stakes. Closing reconfiguration ("taught the towers to sing") inevitable from particulars.</comment>
