<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Skeptical Liora's contradictory impulses—scoffing at magic yet tracing symbols "as a rebellion against silence"—earn her shift to cartographer of echoes, embodied in ink-stained hands and hitching breath.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as tile-handling density builds to inward space-stretch RR/CR, with legible cost in "grief, like the sea, was never just one wave" closing the arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tower and whales' song constrain choices (parchment flutters, stones soften) and charge final image of humming bones tuned to brave echoes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to summon echo escalates via protagonist's transcribing agency under whale-song pressure, crystallizing stance with ongoing grief cost in final reaching for next memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Non-literal resonance in "magic wasn’t in the tile, but in the transcribing. In the trying" reweights skepticism via particulars of tile and whales without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (stars as "gas and fire," sea's remembering) and rhythmic modulation peak coherently in symphony crescendo without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via purposeful whale-song refrain; minor figurative density in peak stretch supports textural lens without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian tile unlocking entangled memories amid whales transforms summoning trope into fresh conceptual risk, inevitable in skeptic's arc.</comment>
