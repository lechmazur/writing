<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied via rib ache and censer pulse; micro-choices like sketching riddles reveal values under loss. Final endurance to lighter chest earned by causal buildup of calls/maps. Minor archetypal drift in navigator trope slightly tempers distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of maps/calls tightens to Charged Poise closure in "maps weren’t just directions, but anchors" with felt cost of persistent loss now reweighted. Orientation anchored early in station/Lena. Single scene coherent, no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Censer foot as micro-setting constrains perception (pulses, warms, listens) and charges final fogged exhale image. Sensory selective via wind hums, cold bronze mirroring internal geography. Cliffs/station guide isolation choices vividly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating loss) signaled early, textural escalation via fluctuating calls narrows to dialing back/renunciation prompt. Agency in translating riddles forecloses isolation path with lighter chest cost legible. One tightening sufficient, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loss-as-navigable emerges via reverse maps, resonant in final "anchors" reweighting premise without moral. Particulars like inland paths avoid platitudes. Subtext in censer listening invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with perceptual signature in ruin-charting bias; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("The way back"). Rhythm modulates to charged poise at end. No head-hopping, diction biased/selective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels via image integration (antenna groans into calls). No loops/artifacts; figurative purposeful (patina as bruises) without muddle. Closure image clear/sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost calls/reverse migrations transforms ghost story tropes via patchwork building. Risky lyric texture heightens stakes organically. Inevitable in hindsight via censer callbacks.</comment>
