<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Charmed skeptic's arc peaks in the burial despite prior scoffing, with contradictory impulses embodied in trembling hands and forehead to soil; final endurance of arrest feels earned by layered memories fed to lattice. No unearned epiphanies or label-speak; micro-choices reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shell whispers to garden shudder/song, culminating in Charged Poise RR as patrol hesitates amid blooming name; cost legible in her emptied chest and cart ride. Orientation anchored in opening garden/kneel; single scene coherent, no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Velvet garden constrains burial choice and evolves (petals blacken/silver, hum to song), charging closure image; scents (forget-me-nots, ozone/roses) and twilight-to-dawn filter through skeptic's urgent perception. Sensory hierarchy narrows to soil pulse/lily vein under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory archiving vs erasure) signaled early, escalates via lattice amplification and garden reaction forcing patrol confrontation; agency in feeding worst memory narrows options with embodied cost (empty chest). Lens-driven tightening reweights independence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of rebellion-through-remembering emerges from shell-to-lattice spread, final image (garden spelling name, distant dreams) offers non-literal CR repricing quarantine as futile; no moralizing, complexity in her isolation-to-library arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited voice stable, perceptual signature in "shell pulsed... tragically radiant" and biased noticing (lilies over forget-me-nots); rhythm modulates from whisper to thrumming harmony under stress. Her closing line carries subtextual challenge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "Petals blackened at the edges, then silvered" weaves action/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds, though minor metaphor density in peak burial risks overwrite (−0.2). Closure image clear, no artifacts dulling it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quarantined memories via shell/lattice transforms dystopia trope into resonant archive-rebellion; garden blooming name as fresh CR risks boldly, synthesizing premise organically without retreat.</comment>
