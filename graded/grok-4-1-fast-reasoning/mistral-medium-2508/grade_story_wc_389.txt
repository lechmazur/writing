<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's shift from hesitant listener to unhinged prophet-hand is earned through embodied shakes, sealing the crack, and hurling the receiver, revealing contradictory impulses under allegiance pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as transmission fragments densify to Charged Poise closure when portico drinks the receiver and city rises, with wailing betrayal as legible cost; orientation anchored by paragraph 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Portico as micro-setting constrains soldering, hurling, and final touch, charging the bruised dawn image; storm's ozone/static hum and pulsing veins evolve tactilely with events.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical prophetic signature in biased noticing (frequencies as bones, portico veins) stable in single close-POV; rhythm modulates from whisper to scream peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("drunk the device whole, rippling like water") without loops or muddle; figurative pulse purposeful in accum mode, clear at closure hurl.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh radio-myth portico synthesis transforms prophet trope via gritty assembly, with shadow-city risk heightening stakes to inevitable crown-throne reconfiguration.</comment>
