<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied endurance in breath syncing with refuge pulse and edges blurring, earning stasis as witness; loose reality trait enables without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, slightly limiting 9+ depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in keeper's blurring edges and self-dissolution as final image; cost legible in "their face had forgotten how to hold expressions," reconfiguring personhood with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via origami unlocking monolith seam and river lapping shelves, charging final swan fold; vivid sensory filter (moss-swallowed books, backward river) mirrors loose POV without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unjudging witness endures via textural deepening (swan dissolving into birds walls drink); one tightening in refuge visions narrows to renunciation cost of buried name and blurred self, legible under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of meaning in slippage emerges organically via swan-to-birds dissolution and keeper-as-fold image, reweighting silence as answer without moralizing; resonant non-literal closure in "the waiting was the point."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable lyrical POV with perceptual signature in time-as-leaf and dust-reforming languages; rhythmic modulation peaks in refuge's alive silence, purposeful compression taught early and legible at blurring-edges closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax (short breaths amid long pools); purposeful silence/repetition pattern-taught avoids loops, though minor regenerative motif echo risks paraphrase but serves motif without dulling final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami as refuge key unfolding into self-dissolving birds transforms hermit trope; risk in lyric time-dissolution heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via memorized creases charging closure.</question>
