<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's bitterness as "religion" roots clear motivation, intensifying to earned choice at "He chose the latter"; contradictory impulses in ignoring warning vs. hunting sister show via micro-choices like picking arrowhead. Herbalist applies secondary pressure effectively. Minor slip: emotions poetic over fully embodied in peak vines/pull moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrowhead unearth to phone confession to vines/swallow, landing CR closure in "The garden swallowed him whole" with transformation cost legible. Orientation anchored early in garden dig. Single surreal scene fits scope; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Underground garden (loam, sage, pulsing mushrooms) constrains choices via erupting vines and charges final image of roots singing; sensory hierarchy (smells, pulses syncing breath) reflects Elias's urgency. Micro-setting as garden body/roots mirrors internal harmony, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hunt cryptid/sister via garden) tightens via phone reversal ("cosmic joke") narrowing to choice, with agency in laughter back; cost felt in metamorphosis foreclosing humanity. Escalation coheres accumulatively without coincidence resolution. Band met: trade-off charges image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of untamed harmony/joke emerges via particulars (arrowhead-seed, shadows with sister's smile), resonant in final laughter/petals without moralizing; subtext in herbalist's warnings invites ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from cosmic joke repricing bitterness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in syntax/rhythm (e.g., "stars moved like schools of fish"), perceptual bias surreal-specific; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Some hungers aren’t meant to be fed"). Stable third-limited with intentional late herbalist shift; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud, density high, but minor overwrite in climax metaphors ("warm as a lover’s fingers," "frost on glass") risks muddle without pattern payoff; purposeful loops ("some ... weren’t meant") taught early. No scaffold obscuring closure; strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms cryptid tropes via gravitational arrowhead/cosmic joke synthesis, inevitable in hindsight from garden harmony; bold surreal risks (phone self-call, metamorphosis) heighten stakes organically. Fresh premise angle on loss as punchline.</comment>
