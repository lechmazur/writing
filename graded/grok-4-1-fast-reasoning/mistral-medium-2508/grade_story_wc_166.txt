<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied micro-choices like trembling fingers dipping for Orion's reflection, revealing contradictory nostalgia and forward drive; earned change in becoming the gap with exile's cost. Minor abstraction in emotions slightly distances peak embodiment, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density tightening from observation (heron gap) to verse blooming ("first line bloomed"); Charged Poise closure in standing with shimmering ink-map reconfigures exile into freedom, cost legible in "sea would not take her back."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Twilight garden vividly constrains ritual—blackened pond supplies fractured Orion reflection for verse-start, waterlilies' sharp edges and nightshade scent mirror internal hunger; stars drawn into net charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to fledge escalates texturally via dust's bite and verse's cold weight, narrowing sea-return option; agency in pressing dust forces trade-off, cost felt in permanent severance as ink pulses second heartbeat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of exile-as-ajar-door emerges organically from shore sigil to map-confession, reweighting sea-pride vs. sky-openness; final "ink shimmered, alive" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias toward rhythms/gaps ("move between the cracks"); rhythmic control modulates to charged poise at "arms outstretched," no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion—varied syntax accelerates from "watched" to "bloomed under her fingertips"; no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent and pattern-taught in lyric mode, clarity peaks at closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tide exile into sky-fledging via self-inked verse transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric gaps heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from dust-anchoring to star-net.</comment>
