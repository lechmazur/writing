<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—fidgeting as both nervous tic and productive unraveling—act simultaneously in the decoding beat, earning the final steady-handed checkmate laughter with visible cost of absorbed regret. Interiority concrete via thread-whispers of pawn sacrifice and knight betrayal; no epiphanies unearned. Flaw of hesitation compounds via girl recognition before reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of thread-fragments and memory-shifts builds to RR closure in "weave the frayed threads back... pattern now a map of scars," with legible cost in warmed platinum absorbing regret. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (exiled tutor, frozen village, labyrinth). One tightening via border confession narrows shame-options purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth constrains core choice (kneel to etched failure) and charges final empty mirror image; time-frozen village (child's mid-laughter, stirring figures) mirrors internal thaw tactilely. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: metallic veins hum thunder-lull, threads burn fingertips. No white-room; spatial coherence from edge to heart to inn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness for hesitation-move) signaled early via fourth-move miss; accumulative deepening in thread-confession and girl-hand-take forecloses exile-path with felt shame-cost crystallized in reset-board play. Agency via productive fiddling tests commitment; no coincidence resolution. Visible trade-off: win not to conquer, but stay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness-as-weaving-scars emerges organically from chess-labyrinth particulars, reweighted in final "board remained... played on" image answering "play to win or stay?" without moral. Subtext in silence (villagers witness, no speech needed); ambiguity lingers in scars-not-sins map.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with tutor-signature: perception frames world as chess-moves (labyrinth walls shift in memory, threads as plucking lies). Lyrical rhythm modulates from sharp breath to hearth-lullaby; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("You left before the end"). No head-hopping; perceptual bias selective to regrets.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-job (e.g., "hands, never still, winnowed through the threads" advances action/character/atmosphere). Rhythmic variety in short punchy revelations amid lyric flow; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—thunder-lull pattern-taught coheres. Minor overwriting in stacked images (e.g., "fierce repose") purposeful without obscuring closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chess-tutor decodes regret-labyrinth via tapestry-threads, transforming redemption trope into tactile "map of scars"; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from early woven-hush to final steady hands; no template echoes.</comment>
