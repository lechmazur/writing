<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation as obituarist for the living intensifies through concrete micro-choices like pressing the thread to his lips, embodying contradictory impulses of mourning and seeking; final renunciation of mere chronicling for mapping earns closure reconfiguration with felt cost in pocketed relics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early orientation in garden/thread; density tightens via thread's pull to locket discovery, culminating in CR closure ("healing was not a place, but a direction") where ongoing silences reweight absence as direction with undeniable conceptual cost in the final harbor walk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shadowed autumn garden anchors vividly and purposefully, with weeping willow branches constraining discovery (bench half-buried in loam) and charging final image as waiting witness; sensory hierarchy (damp earth, pulsing thread) reflects Elias's perceptual priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping absence escalates accumulatively through thread-warmed deepening that narrows from chronicling to finding, agency in following pull foreclosing passive mourning with legible cost in pocketed locket's defiant gaze pressing ribs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of explained absences emerges organically from particulars like crimson thread and smudged portrait, reweighted non-literally in ending ("absences are explanations, not endings") with resonant ambiguity charging final thread-as-compass image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice sustains distinct perceptual signature (absences' "shape," thread's "pulse") with rhythmic modulation under reflective pressure; stable close-third POV biases details character-particularly, elisions patterned and legible toward closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels with varied syntax and sensory propulsion, but figurative density (e.g., "sails swallowing the horizon," "sky was a bruise") borders overwriting in opening without early pattern-teaching, slightly dulling peak garden pull; no loops or scaffolds obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Obituarist-for-living premise transforms absence tropes into fresh cartography of healing via thread/locket synthesis; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes inevitably, with defiant portrait recharging hindsight ingenuity.</comment>
