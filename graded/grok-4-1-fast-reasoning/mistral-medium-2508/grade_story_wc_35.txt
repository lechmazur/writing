<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied interiority shines in tasting memories as citrus or caramel, with contradictory endurance of burden shown in distilling and pouring; final clean tongue earns unburdening with ongoing cost of pavilion's call.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds from courtyard to pavilion ritual to kitchen return; closure as Charged Poise in clean mouth reconfigures relief against cycle's cost, with orientation anchored early in fortress/desert.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pavilion's briny pools and fossilized grief constrain pouring choice and charge final unburdened shadow; sensory selectivity (wet stone, iron scent) mirrors Elias's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of smoothing remorse tightens accumulatively via distillation to pouring reversal, narrowing to earned release; cost legible in "pavilion would call again," charging poised return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of tending grief emerges organically from tasting/subsume ritual, reweighted in final salt-redemption image without moralizing; ambiguity in endless duty invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in synesthetic tastes and textures; rhythmic modulation under ritual pressure, minimal dialogue natural in apprentice exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and sensory propulsion; minor figurative density ("moon bleed") purposeful in lyric texture without muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting chef and contagious coral grief storage transforms remorse trope; risk in emotional contagion pays off in charged, inevitable cycle closure.</comment>
