<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and embodied emotion culminate in throat tightening at wife's lullaby; motivation rooted in daughter's flicker of hunger earns closure endurance with felt cost of fragile success; minor reflection summaries slightly abstract impulses but tilt present choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of gear alignments and reflections builds to resonant reconfiguration at "high, clear note"; on-page closure Charged Poise with warble cost and season thinning legible in final ticking image; orientation anchored early in cavern/timer setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marble veins and reflection angles constrain gear study and charge split-image moment; sensory hierarchy (cold breath fogging, groaning skin) mirrors urgency, evolving to ice weeping; body/tools as micro-setting propel reverse-engineering payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to hold echoes before thaw signaled early, tightens via "worked faster" as season ends under Accumulative lens; agency in final gear sigh forecloses thinning loss with warble price on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of rewinding wonder emerges from particulars like stored laughter jars to final lullaby reprise reweighting memory's fragility without moral; resonant non-literal answer in timer left running charges prior cellar motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature ("peripherally focused," shadow bends) biases noticing; lyrical diction/rhythm modulates to peak compression at "final gear slotted... sigh"; purposeful elision of times pays off in charged overlap image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; minor figurative density in reflections purposeful and pattern-taught without muddle or loops; precise verbs ("traced fractured edges") avoid scaffolds in peak gear beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith reverse-engineering echoes transforms preservation trope via peripheral focus and wounded season; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in heartbeat tick hindsight.</comment>
