<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion in "thumb hovered over the transmit switch" and "cautiously hopeful heart pounding," revealing contradictory impulses under pressure; motivation to outwit rooted in expertise compels interference with felt risk. Minor backstory summary slightly dilutes peak agency, but micro-choices earn final endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: signal change detected, her subsonic pulse causes campus falter and alien response, adjustment triggers "pattern dissolved into something new—still alien, but less predatory, more… curious"—Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost of ongoing dialogue felt on-page. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in basement radio station.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Astronomical charts as recurring object constrain calibration and smudge with sleeves, charging final rustle under charts; sensory hierarchy (static hiss, dial notches, skull pressure) filters through Liora's expertise, mirroring internal shifts. Setting's old equipment and locked doors pressure illicit access, evolving with ventilation kick-on.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove agency vs. signal's participation in divisions) tightens causally: transmit forecloses passive observation, response forces adjustment narrowing options; cost legible in "teeth ache" pressure and pounding heart, charging final poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of human agency amid cosmic meddling emerges organically from interference shifting signal from predatory to curious, reweighting divisions as "scars—proof they’d survived"; final image of reaching for dial answers without stating moral, lingering ambiguity intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable with perceptual signature (cosmic patterns as "dare," signals as "taunting"); voice modulates rhythm with pressure, diction like "nest of angry stars" character-specific to interpreter. Brief dialogue natural, goal-driven, distinct from narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "charts proved it" advances plot/character); rhythm varies, propulsion strong in peak transmit beats. Minor simile density ("needle pulling string," "reflection in disturbed water") risks overwrites but coherent, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of campus politics as cosmic frequency meddling transforms tropes via signal's participatory "dare"; risk in subsonic gambit heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
