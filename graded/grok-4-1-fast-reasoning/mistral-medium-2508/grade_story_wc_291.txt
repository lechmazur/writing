<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's face-blindness drives perceptive strengths in texture and resonance, with contradictory impulses (past failure vs. present witnessing) peaking in the lance vision where buried empathy surfaces as embodied weight. Final renunciation of stillness costs emotional exposure, earned by prior micro-choices like whispering "Liora." No stock phrasing; traits complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ribbon cue to mist-shapes of struggle, culminating in Charged Poise RR as lance seals memory and Elias carries the secret with felt empathetic cost ("methodical heart a little less still"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; one tightening via vision narrows unseen truth. Cost legible in final pocket tuck and walk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quarry's micro-setting (slick steps, crack for lance) constrains descent/kneeling and charges closure image; mist/textures mirror internal guilt via Elias's non-visual bias ("cold seeped like old guilt"). Sensory hierarchy sharpens under ritual urgency; evolves causally to shapes/hands.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witness Liora's erasure to awaken empathy) signaled via ribbon; accumulative escalation tightens in lance vision, forcing empathetic trade-off with visible cost in trembling grip and heart shift. Agency via offering ribbon/whisper; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing erased opposites emerges organically from lance ritual and echo; final image (ribbon as promise, walk to cough) reconfigures seeing-the-unseen without moralizing, reweighting past failure via child's sound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature (silence weights, textures over faces); rhythmic compression heightens ritual ("metal hummed... vibrated in his teeth"). Whispered "Liora" carries subtext; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: varied syntax accelerates vision ("mist thickened into shapes—hands, a struggle"); no loops or scaffolds, metaphors consistent (mist as breath/echo). Minor figurative density in opening fits taught pattern, untouching closure.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-story tropes via face-blind lance ritual in flooded-ballroom quarry; fresh synthesis of non-visual seer and cold-case echo feels inevitable, with risk-taking in textured lyricism heightening empathetic stakes.</question>
