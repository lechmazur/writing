<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Conflicted novelist's interior contradiction—fighting upstream vs. yielding—acts in scene via tracing shell and murmuring "I'm listening," earning final dissolution with embodied cost of softening edges.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragments accumulate density to pattern break at "I'm listening," yielding Conceptual Repricing closure where Elias dissolves, cost legible in "his edges softening into the story."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Feral nexus with mist and whirlpools constrains choices, supplies cameos, and charges final image of man on rocks; sensory hierarchy (damp pages, swirling hush) filters through watchful POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control novel vs. yield to current) signaled early, deepens via cameos' pressure to agency in listening/writing; cost unmistakable in dissolution foreclosing self.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of stories/hope as feral currents emerges via particulars (cameos reshaping narrative); final image ("Hope is not a shape you carve—it's the current you learn to ride") reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (lucidly watchful noticing fragments); rhythmic control modulates from hush to torrent, eliding nothing unearned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (ink bleeding into sentences); minor simile density pre-peak but purposeful water motif; no loops, closure image sharp ("ink shimmered as if still wet").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of writerly block as magical dissolution at nexus; risky lyric merger of self/story heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from shell/current particulars.</comment>
