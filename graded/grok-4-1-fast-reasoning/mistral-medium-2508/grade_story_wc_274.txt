<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in hesitation over the warm letter and prior anomalies, earning the final command input; embodied stress peaks in shaking hands and scandalized pulse. Final martyrdom renunciation forecloses safety with her life as cost. No unearned epiphanies or label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: letter arrival → reading anomalies → system flood → alarms/Overseers → death as CR closure with legible cost in "guns fired" and martyr scroll. Single scene oriented early via Vaults and cryo-pods; one tightening via decision suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Snowfall and hush constrain isolation chamber choice, charging final "snow kept falling, library kept breathing" image; sensory hierarchy (frost-laced spines, ozone/gunpowder) filters through archivist bias. Evolving details mirror internal scream without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose vs incinerate) signaled by letter, tightens via flood command narrowing to death; agency in inputting drives causal escalation, cost unmistakable in boots thundering and impact "sinking into silence."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of silenced past gaining voice emerges implicitly via spreading truths and martyr flicker reweighting premise without moralizing; final image answers "remembered" stance resonantly. No tidy binaries or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in hush/frost diction; rhythmic modulation accelerates from "pulse scandalized" to "screens flared"; brief dialogue natural/subtextual in "I've just remembered."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "breath fogged... input the command"; varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors consistent (barb hook, ghost breath). Minor overwrites in opening avoid peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh cryo-archive conspiracy transforms trope via "dormant networks" pulsing truths; risk in lyrical sci-fi voice heightens martyr closure without gimmickry. Non-obvious letter warmth as alive hook inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
