<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied through cloud-emotion lens, with surrender as earned renunciation costing prior isolation; contradictory impulses in waiting for snap vs. reaching out. Minor slip: epiphanic blur of faces in clouds feels slightly unearned without prior micro-choice friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density tightens to CR closure: gondola touches down "with a sigh" reconfiguring separation into wholeness, cost legible in "surrender" fall. Orientation anchored immediately; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gondola/telescope as micro-settings constrain choices (adjusting lens amid sway) and charge final image (pressed to chest, humming); sensory hierarchy meteorologist-specific (cloud fraying as emotion). Atmosphere purposefully mirrors internal via gusts parting clouds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (engage sky-memory) signaled early, escalates via density to surrender-deepening under lens, foreclosing isolation with fall-cost; agency in "let himself fall *into*". One tightening sufficient, charges Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of remembering-in-emptiness emerges organically from cloud particulars, final "sky *was* the remembering" as resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in thread-light spools prior losses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (clouds as faces/breath); rhythmic modulation peaks in short, charged fall sentences. Voice texture reflects desperate lyricism consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful motif recurrence (empty spaces, thread); rhythm varies for propulsion, metaphors coherent (clouds unraveling). Minor overwrite: adjacent "humming" (air, metal) risks echo but pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-as-cloud-emotions and adrift gondola transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric CR heightens stakes, inevitable in "thread... stitching... never been separate."</comment>
