<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation as a timekeeper unable to fix his own time intensifies through embodied details like the warm urn and trembling fingers, earning his final smile and resolve. Interior conflict emerges in ritualistic watch adjustments under pressure, with flaws like running out of time driving the climb. No on-page relationships, but single-POV micro-choices reveal values; lacks overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (messages, capsule) build density to CR closure where the watch "tickled... wilder" reconfigures time as a loom with conceptual cost in unfinished work ahead. Orientation anchored early (silo, condemned post-time shift). Single scene/shards cohere; no causality breaks, pattern taught via scratches pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silo walls' garage sale items and scratches constrain ascent and charge discoveries, mirroring internal states (e.g., "pocket mirror reflecting a face that wasn’t his"). Sensory details selective (groaning door, flickering bulb) filter through timekeeper bias. Micro-setting (urn, twin watch) evolves causally, grounding surreal timeframe without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stitch frayed time, now personal) signaled early, tightens via pattern-deepening (messages to capsule) under Accumulative lens, narrowing to reconfiguration. Agency in climbing/picking watch forecloses doubt with felt cost ("work to do"). No reversals needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise, but abstract stakes slightly mute visceral price for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (time as garage sale/loom) emerges organically from particulars like scratched messages and spilled capsule, reweighting premise in final note/image without statement. Subtext in silences (groaning door, hitched breath) invites ambiguity; protagonist arc inextricable. Resonant non-literal close ("bell rang... chime—forward, backward") answers texture question with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (time motifs: "clocks counting backward," "heartbeat after long sleep"). Voice texture distinct in syntax/rhythm (e.g., coiled staircase simile modulates tension). No dialogue; purposeful compression legible, elision (Marlen's full story) pays off in realization without withholding facts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, propulsion in varying rhythm (short punchy sentences at discoveries); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors (e.g., "overripe fruit" coherent). Figurative language purposeful, not overwrought in peak (capsule spill). Minor register elevation ("fossilized spring") fits poetic voice but borders drift; closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: time unraveled via garage sales/silo loom transforms tropes organically, inevitable in hindsight from urn note to twin watch tickle. Risky surreal conceit (time skips, messages) heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative echoes, bold conceptual integrity to CR.</comment>
