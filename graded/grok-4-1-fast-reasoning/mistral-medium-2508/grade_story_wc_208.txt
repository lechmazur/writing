<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's perpetual learning trait drives the carving choice at the climax, embodied in the driftwood's "curse and gift," revealing character through micro-choice under isolation pressure. Minor slip in idealized harmony of impulses without sharper contradiction, but prior causality earns the final renunciation of solo artistry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layers build from slide visions to archway loom realization, with on-page CR closure as path unspools post-carving ("the wind changed"), cost legible in empty pockets but remembered weight. Orientation anchored early (storm, archway by para 2); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archway and storm constrain choices (crevice for carving, parted waves post-ritual), charging final image; selective sensory hierarchy (turbine-hum, salt-crusted stone) mirrors POV's driftwood gaze. Micro-setting via blackthorn piece evolves tactilely with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (marooned, find path home) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via slide's deepening layers narrowing to communal carving agency, foreclosing isolation with cost of slide's loss. Climax turn ("He pressed the lantern to the arch") driven by protagonist, cost unmistakable in flared light and unspooling path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of simple scaffolds holding time's vast connections emerges organically from layered visions and hand-carving, final image (driftwood boat in pocket) offering non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Recurring layers motif reweights premise via particulars, no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "bones of the world" filtering sustains single POV stability; brief dialogue ("Not anymore") natural, subtext-laden. Rhythmic modulation peaks in reverie ("light spilled out—not forward, but sideways"), elision purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "golden stitches" integrates action/atmosphere without muddle; varied syntax/rhythm in peak beat avoids loops. Minor figurative density in visions allowable as pattern-taught, no scaffold obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of driftwood craft and timewoven archway loom transforms marooned trope into communal CR; carving hand ("palm open, fingers stretched") inflects boldly from prior beast/saint habits, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
