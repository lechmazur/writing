<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias's mystic traits drive concrete micro-choices like tracing the prism and reading frost patterns, with contradictory belief in echoes culminating in the hurling act that forecloses proof-chasing with embodied cost in empty pockets.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via intensifying sensory echoes (frost reading to moving face), delivering on-page Resonant Reconfiguration when prism shatters soundlessly, vibrating air with legible emotional release cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quartz arbor and mist constrain communion by providing stillness and thickening to swallow the car, charging final image where branches chime like settling debts; frost patterns as micro-setting enable pivotal vision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to prove emotional absorption tightens through agency-driven deepening (palm press yields vision/prism hum), narrowing to renunciation with cost in prism's facets cutting palm before hurl.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of "truthful lies" in objects emerges organically via frost face's warning and final melt into "sorrowless streams," reweighting proof-seeking without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in empty hands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with mystic perceptual signature (measuring silence in degrees, frost as script) modulates rhythm under stress, as in ragged breaths during vision; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in peak (e.g., "The frost on the window *moved*"), no loops or artifacts dulling shatter climax; figurative coherence like "facets cutting into his palm" embodies cost without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of object-empathy mysticism transforms ghost tropes via prism's answering hum and frost-mother face, with risk-taking in lyric texture heightening stakes to inevitable unproven-proof closure.</comment>
