<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's adaptive patience, rooted in childhood ridge memory, compels the eclipse choice and earns Mira's hum with embodied contradiction in his itching fingers and quiet observation. Secondary characters pressure via Lila's vial and Mira's swaying, forcing micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of listening over fixing. Mira's fractured hum and linked hands show earned change with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as childhood shard, therapy progression, and eclipse density reconfigure silence-to-song with Mira's gasp-to-hum as Resonant Reconfiguration and ridge response as Charged Poise; cost legible in "tears of someone who’d just remembered how to wonder." Mosaic shards taught early by ridge singing pattern; orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sage Ridge constrains eclipse choice and charges climax as stones hum and sagebrush shivers, mirroring internal harmony; vial curl glows in half-light, functioning as micro-setting that triggers hum. Sensory hierarchy (iron taste, blood in veins) reflects Elias's auditory bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mira's lost voice/wonder—tightens accumulatively from swaying to eclipse deepening, narrowing options via accident shadow and vial; agency in Elias's ridge song forecloses silence with felt cost in Lila's sob and Mira's tears. One pressure point sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ordinary magic emerges organically via ridge hum and Mira's hum weaving in, reweighting premise in final client twitch without moralizing; ridge callback charges image, embracing ambiguity of "magic...just needed to be heard."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with perceptual signature in sound metaphors ("tuning fork," "plucked bass string"); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Trust me," "Listen") advances goals. Rhythmic control modulates to peak hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("One note. Two. A fractured, wordless phrase"); no loops, purposeful metaphors integrate without muddle in climax hum/ringing. Minor figurative density in opener contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of therapy, eclipse, and sentient ridge transforms sound-healing trope; ridge song reprise feels inevitable, risk in magical realism grounded in sensory specificity heightens stakes.</comment>
