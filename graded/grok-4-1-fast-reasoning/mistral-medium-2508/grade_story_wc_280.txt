<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lydia's synesthesia and stage-ghost motivation compel concrete micro-choices like rolling the coin and pulling timelines, earning her fade-out with felt cost in her non-star role. Elias's hollow-eyed despair mirrors hers authentically through embodied reaction. Contradictory impulses in her nudge-vs-fade act simultaneously in the bench scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of synesthetic impressions builds to Charged Poise closure where Elias pockets pills and steps forward, her fading the legible cost in the final bow image. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in orchard/maze/theater. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard maze constrains via shifting paths and leaning trees that obey her pull, charging the swaying approval in closure. Synesthetic sensory hierarchy (taste of caramel, indigo sighs) filters through Lydia's bias, vivid and purposeful. Micro-setting of bench/fruit/coin grounds spatial choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (luring Elias from despair) signaled early, deepens via intertwined visions pressing his ribs, forcing his hand-close on coin under Accumulative lens. Agency in her producing possibilities forecloses suicide path with on-page cost of her softening edges.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of echoes stitching timelines emerges organically from coin/visions/orchard particulars, answered non-literally in "music tasted like hope" reweighting her ghost role. Subtext in her "never the star" lingers with ambiguity of endless encores. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature (violin scent, dusk color-sound) biases noticing distinctively; POV stable in Lydia without slippage. Voice modulates rhythm with pressure, prose texture controlled in fading edges. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("wrong act").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., coin roll bleeds echoes into air advancing plot/character); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Synesthetic figures coherent/voice-motivated, no overwriting in peak vision beat or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic ghost magic in orchard transforms suicide intervention trope via timeline-weaving and coin-anchor, fresh synthesis inevitable in violin-hope image. Bold synesthesia-risk heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
