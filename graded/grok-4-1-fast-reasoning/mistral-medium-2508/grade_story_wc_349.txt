<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation rooted in belief about stories' pauses drives concrete micro-choices like incising the slate; embodied insight peaks in "She exhaled, understanding." Patron applies targeted pressure without overshadowing. Minor lack of contradictory impulses limits exceptional tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from lull to fracture to charged waiting; CR closure in final needle pickup with cost of unopened moonlight legible on page. Orientation anchored early in glass orchard; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass branches, quartz counter, ink-ozone wind constrain choices and charge final image of swirling clouds; sensory hierarchy reflects Liora's priorities. Setting evolves subtly with shelves shifting post-trade.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of quantifying absence tightens via incising reversal, narrowing to fracture revelation; cost felt in traded moonlight's retained darkness. Agency in Liora's listening incising forecloses blankness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of absence defining stories emerges organically via fracture and unopened vial; final "silence breaks" reweights premise without statement. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual bias toward pauses stable in single POV; dialogue sparse but subtextual ("glimmering parole"). Rhythm modulates to charged poise at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (pause, waiting); no loops or artifacts dull closure. Minor figurative density in peak trade beat contained by pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of slate-fracture as story-origin transforms abstract premise into tactile cycle; risk in poetic fragmentation heightens stakes without obscurity.</comment>
