<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's obsession with illuminated moments drives savvy decoding of flowers and hurling the jar, earning her reconfiguration with embodied exhale and smile under pressure; contradictory impulses peak at mirror's older self. Minor abstraction in "became it" softens embodiment but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as motif density (light/flowers/time) tightens to CR closure: jar hurled at mirror sighs release, station vanishes with ledger cost legible. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Jar constrains climax hurl, flowers enable unlock, moonlight/emerald station evolve causally to silver flood and vanishing, charging final horizon image. Sensory hierarchy (light pulses, whistle screams) filters through Liora's thief-priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (steal guarded portrait) signaled early, escalates via unlocks → mirror reveal → confrontation → jar agency, narrowing to miss train with felt cost (empty hands, dark carried). Under lens, density reweights to Charged Poise at stars blinking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of stealing light vs. carrying dark emerges organically from countdown portraits and ledger phrase, resonant in final "light remained" reweighting without moralizing. Counter-reading ambiguity (free fate or inevitable dark) lingers from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in light-flicker bias and rhythmic syntax modulates to short hurl sentences under stress; dialogue sparse but subtextual ("not here to steal... to listen"). Pattern-taught elision pays off in CR image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers closed around the glass" advances action/foreshadow); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops/artifacts, metaphors consistent (light as breath/sigh) without muddle in peak jar collision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms thief trope via countdown portraits/mirror reinterpretation and time-code flowers into fresh synthesis; bold lyric CR ("she became it") risks high, inevitable from motifs, heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
