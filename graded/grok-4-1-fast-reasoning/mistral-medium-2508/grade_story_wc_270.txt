<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied motivation shines in Liora's plant telepathy constraining her secrecy until the vines' chorus at unseal; contradictory impulses peak in refusing sacred grove replanting. Grandson's quick reversal slightly softens relational crucible but doesn't undermine her earned defiance. Final endurance of heresy cost seals arc integrity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via symbol unfolding to unseal DC, culminating in RR as vines knit ruins and people listen; cost legible in elder's wavering "doomed us" vs. singing earth. Kite-to-amber causality tight without slips; single scene anchors early, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hot springs constrain unseal (heat syncing pulse) and charge closure (cradle of tendrils); black sand, whisper-vines tactile and POV-biased toward growth. Sensory hierarchy narrows to mineral air, root-burn under crisis, mirroring internal roots breaking stone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unseal destiny vs. Council cage) signaled early via grandson flashback, tightens accumulatively as symbols demand voice, forcing "Rebirth" agency; cost felt in overseer confrontation before vine conversion. Escalation coheres without reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of tradition-as-ladder emerges organically via vine-knitting ruins stronger, kite-script flower reweighting premise without statement; resonant CR in plants telling story, ambiguity in Council's shift lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature (symbols rearranging like flower, plants humming) stable, rhythmic diction modulates from hums to chorus crescendo; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Tradition isn’t a cage"), distinct from narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with metaphors (veins pulsing, seed pod sigh) pattern-taught via vines motif, propelling to closure without loops or drift; varied rhythm varies with intensity, ear-test clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic plants, implanted embryo, kite-veins transforms rebel-grandma trope via grounded ritual defiance; risk in lyric plant-chorus payoff heightens stakes organically.</comment>
