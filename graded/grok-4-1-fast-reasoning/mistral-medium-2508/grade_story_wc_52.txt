<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (never weeps yet hands ache, half-gone but presses on); final endurance to keep the carving earned by prior carving compulsion and "stopping—was a kind of death too." Motivation rooted in specific traits intensifies organically to compel the closing renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of carving routines and images tightening to Charged Poise closure: widow keeps lion on sill, reconfiguring "contain him" into letting go, cost legible in "alternative—stopping... death too" and glowing embers image. Orientation anchored early (loft, morning routine); single scene with taught pattern, no shards overload.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (damp cedar musk, rain-beaded skylight fracturing light) selectively filtered through widow's tactile priorities, constraining climbs and carving; final rain droplets scattering "rust-hued peace" charges closure image, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contain absent husband via carving vs. letting go) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via girl’s question deepening "here and gone," dream collapse, to agency in keeping carving—foreclosing market-sale path with felt endurance cost. One tightening sufficient under lens; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of harvesting lessons from loss emerges implicitly through carving particulars and shifting lion images, culminating in non-literal final answer: lions "always be leaving," she carves on—one cut at a time reweights prior containment attempts without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tactile, grain-focused noticing ("rough against her calloused palms," "thumb over half-finished mane"); stable close-third POV with rhythmic modulation (short pressured cuts amid lyrical stretches); sparse dialogue natural, subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied syntax/rhythm, but minor figurative density ("light fractured like old glass," "steam curling into... things she would never name") borders overwriting without muddle; no loops, clean grammar, closure image propels sharply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-as-carving transforms lion-tamer trope through specific ash blanks and "here and gone" elusiveness; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes of endurance, inevitable in hindsight via routine's tightening pattern.</comment>
