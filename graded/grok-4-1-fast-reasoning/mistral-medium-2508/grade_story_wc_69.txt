<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to reclaim harmony through silences is rooted in concrete traits and intensifies via remnant arrivals; interiority particular via rosette as student's sigh. Contradictory endurance (not fixing but listening to cracks) earns final hum with cost in thin voices. Secondary characters apply pressure through fragile presences without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of loss to Charged Poise RR closure in humming and rosette vibration; cost legible in "thin as thread" and "possibility of it." Single scene oriented early (Elias/library/rosette morning find); one tightening via choir entry to collective hum holds lens without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Velvet library's traveled stillness and stained-glass constrain listening/humming, charging final shimmer; rosette as micro-setting recurs to vibrate in closure image. Sensory selection (scent, light, wind rattle) purposeful, POV-biased toward musical silences; autumn mirrors unlearning without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (remnant harmony vs. hatred's unlearning) signaled early, escalates texturally to humming that forecloses dissolution; agency in Elias's initiation, cost in fragile "negative space." Coherent pressure narrows to presence over loudness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of holding cracks emerges from rosette/chair silences and hatred's peeling; final hum reweights remnants without moral, resonant via "listening to the cracks." Subtext in gestures (touching rosette) embraces ambiguity of not-yet harmony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with musical perceptual signature (notes as leaves, silences denoted) stable in single POV; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("A reminder," "Just… present"). Rhythm modulates to thin threads at peak, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "peeled them layer by layer until only the hollow remained"); rhythmic variety, no loops/artifacts, figurative coherence in music/loss pattern. Closure image crisp without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vanishing choir/hatred via rosette silences and "subtracting noise"; lyric risk on unlearning transforms loss trope. No template echoes, inevitable in hindsight humming.</comment>
