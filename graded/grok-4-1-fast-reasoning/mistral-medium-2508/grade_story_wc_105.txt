<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in synesthetic grief like "bruise of indigo"; final endurance of rust as earned stasis compelled by imprint accumulation, with embodied cost in scarred hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density of imprints tightening to CR closure; cost legible in "waded into the rising tide" extinguishing forge bare-handed, reconfiguring absence premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse and wrecks constrain climax as water pools, charging final aurora image; sensory filter (salt, rotting blossoms, violet hum) mirrors erosion theme through Elias's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of imprinting absences deepens accumulatively to erosion realization; agency in final copper imprint forces trade-off, with visible cost in trembling greenhouse and rising tide.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Erosion theme emerges organically from rust/imprint particulars, answered non-literally by "listen to the rust" CR reweighting memories without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("color of dawn over broken tools") stable and character-specific; rhythmic lyric voice modulates pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and concrete images; purposeful color metaphors accumulate without muddle, though peak density borders overwrite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synesthetic rust-as-trust transforms absence trope boldly; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from imprint particulars.</comment>
