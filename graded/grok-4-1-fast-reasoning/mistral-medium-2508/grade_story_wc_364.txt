<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory meekness and slow-burning will act simultaneously in trembling hands winding silk yet deliberate descent; earned change crystallizes in palm-to-stone press, foreclosing isolation with planet's sigh as relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density build from whispers to azure stitching; on-page RR closure in "The planet answered... with a sigh, the rubble shifting," reconfigures quakes' chaos with silk-spent cost legible in glow and realignment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating arches and pulsing fissure constrain descent and climax choice, mirroring internal resolve; final realignment into bridges charges closure image, evolving causally from shudder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to awaken planet tightens texturally as silk unravels into tremors, protagonist agency in feeding and pressing palm drives reconfiguration; unmistakable cost in silk's expenditure and ground's groan narrows to earned poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Resilience-through-listening emerges organically from particulars like roots and fissures; CR in "cracks not as wounds, but as places where the light got in" reweights premise non-literally, inviting ambiguity without tidiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in "humming with quiet defiance—like the planet itself"; rhythmic modulation peaks in climax without head-hopping, distinct from sparse dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density in "fed the silk into the fissure, inch by deliberate inch, watching as the threads unraveled... stitching themselves into the tremors" propels via layered syntax; zero loops, varied rhythm, no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silk-mending planetary core transforms fantasy tropes via grounded, quiet agency; fresh "barter, barter, barter" whispers and anvil hum synthesize defiance organically, risking lyric scale that heightens stakes.</comment>
