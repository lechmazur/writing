<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vine dresser's motivation rooted in loving the garden "too openly, too strangely" compels her to lead elders to the marble shrine, earning a change with embodied cost in her "withered hands steady." Contradictory impulses act in letting them believe the deception while polishing jagged edges. Final endurance/renunciation of argument forecloses confrontation path, crystallized in her smile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from polishing marbles to garden mending them, delivering Charged Poise closure when elders kneel and admit "This wasn’t in the tally," reconfiguring measurement vs. wonder with conceptual cost in closed ledgers. Orientation anchors immediately in maze center. No lens ambiguity; persistent garden constraint shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden maze constrains choice by guiding elders to center where vines twine marbles, charging closure image of buds pressing cracks. Sensory details like "leaves brushing her shoulders like old apologies" filter through POV bias, evolving causally as paths "shifting just enough." Micro-setting of roots cradling marbles mirrors internal states tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unmeasurable garden loyalty tightens accumulatively when elders crush shoots and declare "deficient," forcing her non-argument lead to center that reweights their pragmatism. Agency in murmuring "Look" and smiling narrows options with felt cost in crushed shoots. Escalation coheres under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of measurable luck vs. wild wonder emerges organically from cracked marbles gleaming "like veins of silver" to garden choosing her with ivy spelling name, offering resonant non-literal answer in wild blooming around silent elders. Subtext in garden's "old apologies" avoids moralizing. Final image reweights premise without thesis statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: garden as sentient ("hedges sighed," "roots cradled them"). Voice modulates poetically under pressure, diction biased toward vine-life (e.g., "vines trained to whisper secrets"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, elder's dry "Your section is deficient" contrasting her murmur.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, varied rhythm (e.g., short "Look," she murmured" amid longer lyric beats), propulsion in image-charged sentences like "cracks gleamed like veins of silver." No overwriting; figurative language purposeful, consistent in garden vein. Clean grammar, precise causality in actions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of anthropomorphic garden and cracked marbles as unmeasurable luck transforms pragmatism trope, with risk in poetic Accumulative lens heightening stakes via sentient maze. Non-obvious turn: garden mends elders' doubt through vine agency. Organic, no derivatives; bold voice commits to premise.</comment>
