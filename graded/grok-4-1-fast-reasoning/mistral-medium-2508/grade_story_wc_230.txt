<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in twitching fingers and truffle-smearing micro-choice act simultaneously under pressure; burial renunciation earned by occlusion buildup with visible conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as occlusion pattern tightens from satchel tuck to truffle mask to ravine burial; on-page DC lands with cost in "roots would swallow it whole," reconfiguring revelation's threat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ravine's exposed roots and "wet mouth" constrain burial choice and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (musk masking gleam) reflects forager priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to occlude eye from truthful world signaled early, deepens accumulatively through warlord men encounter forcing live test; burial forecloses revelation path with conceptual cost legible in indifferent stars.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Burial image offers resonant CR to "kindness is the lie," reweighting virus premise through occlusion particulars without moral statement; sister's scream echoes obliquely in final quiet.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pattern/scent bias ("musk strong enough to mask") and rhythmic compression under stress; stable single POV with no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density in "spat the pulp... smeared... musk thick enough to dull its gleam"; varied rhythm propels occlusion beats to charged closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Empathy virus forcing occlusion via truffles transforms post-apoc truth trope into fresh psychological calculus; burial reweighting feels inevitable from pattern-grounded particulars.</comment>
