<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—sell for survival vs. hold as rebellion—act in scene through embodied agony and micro-choices like bleeding hands during siege, earning final renunciation with Elias's death as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: relic density builds to Conceptual Repricing closure where cog ticks in silt, reweighting erasure with conceptual cost legible in "hand—still reaching" and clerk's rewrite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sewer silt and dripping grates constrain choices (hauling, hiding) and charge final image; recurring cog as micro-setting mirrors internal rebellion, filtered through Elias's relic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve truth vs. erasure) signaled early; agency-driven escalation via dream-tightened decision to stand, with unmistakable cost in rising water and "hand—still reaching."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Competing narratives theme emerges organically from cog/relies vs. Archives; final clerk's sanitized entry offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting "stories rot" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (historical layers in silt, bones); dialogue subtextual ("Garbage lasts") advances stakes; rhythm modulates from calm idiom to charged end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops; purposeful figurative rhythm ("mocking applause," "ticking louder") propels without muddle, peaking cleanly in final "cog settled into the silt, ticking."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-plague revisionism via cog-relic vault; risky CR closure (quiet death as witness) transforms preservation trope, feeling inevitable from sewer particulars.</comment>
