<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to defy hopelessness compels the mosaic-inspired launch with embodied chants and micro-choices like binding powders; earned heavier self as cost in final image reveals character depth without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from arrival to rocket launch as RR closure; stars' return reconfigures sky with felt weight cost in "The world was heavier... And that was how you defied gravity."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Blooms pulsing like heartbeat and gunpowder-lavender dust constrain tower climb and charge launch; fortress vines evolve causally, mirroring internal defiance in final starlit shimmer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of lighting starless sky tightens via mosaic "Defy the weight" to launch reversal; agency in rocket forces star return with visible cost of trembling earth and heavier self.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sparks defying gravity emerges from particulars like kerosene knot and chants; final "One spark at a time" reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Consistent limited POV with perceptual signature of ambient filtering (wind curls, blooms pulse); rhythmic lyricism modulates from hush to wonder without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and sensory integration; minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("petals like embers caught in slow motion") does not obscure launch clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireworks restoring cursed stars via mosaic transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulative drive heightens defiance stakes organically.</comment>
