<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses—grief, resolve, memory via heat-map tracing—earn the closure choice of sailing back with bleeding hands as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: failed note to heat-map pulse to bleeding play yields Charged Poise/CR closure ("silence finally yielding"), cost legible in "fingers bleeding onto the keys" and storm-sailing resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Winterglass and piano constrain choices, charge final image; recurring case/heat-map as micro-setting mirrors internal thaw, sensory narrowing to skin-hums under crisis sharpens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rectify silence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively from null sound to jagged bursts via agency, cost unmistakable in bloodied keys and purposeful storm return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (silence/music as emotion-shape) emerges organically from heat-map melt and glass singing; final hum reweights premise non-literally, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (vibration/emotion focus); rhythmic modulation peaks in "notes came in jagged bursts," purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies propulsively, coherent metaphors (winterglass sang) without muddle, even in peak ("music of things breaking and reforming").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotion-frequency mapping transforms silence trope; risk-taking in lyric fantasy (heat-map melts air) inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes to ship-raising closure.</comment>
