<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's motivation roots deeply in grandmother's lore and evidence-gathering, compelling the assembly and road-following choice with embodied contradiction (warm stones vs. rising water). Micro-choices like tapping reveal values under Voss's protocol pressure. Minor backstory summary slightly abstracts peak defiance, but closure choice feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragments density builds to sonar stutter and road emergence as CR, reweighting world rules with cost (alarms blare, lights flicker out). Orientation anchors early (station, Lena, post-Collapse). No causality breaks; pattern taught via rhythm pays off cleanly in final path gleam.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Barnacled road and warm stones constrain Lena's wading choice and charge final image, filtered through her tidal expertise. Sensory hierarchy (clink-clank gauges to humming stones) mirrors urgency. Setting evolves causally (receding tide exposes road), no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover disappearing paths) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via assembly to road revelation, narrowing options (follow vs. report). Agency in tapping/assembly drives turn; cost legible in rising water and forsaken station. Voss adds situational pressure without resolving via coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of "waiting paths" emerges organically from fragments/rhythm to road's persistence, reweighting memory's power without moralizing. Final image (path gleams amid rising water) offers resonant CR answer to disappearance question. No overt statements; ambiguity lingers in Voss's raw plea.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (tidal rhythms in prose syntax) modulates under stress; diction echoes tapping (quick-slow cadence). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Voss's edge-lacking voice reveals shift). No head-hopping; voice distinct from Voss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies propulsively (short punchy sentences at discovery), high density integrates sensory/prose without loops or scaffolds. Metaphors purposeful (ink bleeding like tears) without muddle in peak (road humming). Clean grammar; final line recharges motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sea-rise trope into "eternal tides" called by ancestral rhythm; road's warm hum transforms premise inevitably. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick. No derivative echoes; particulars (crayon drawing, logbook) ground ingenuity.</comment>
