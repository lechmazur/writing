<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's embodied interiority (pulse stuttered, hands not trembling) and micro-choices under heritage pressure earn final revelation; contradictory walk-away impulse acts in scene with relational cost at elders' confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as adhesive/letter discoveries deepen to Charged Poise closure; elder's nod and "chain gleamed between them" reconfigures options with undeniable social cost on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Amphitheater's breath and volcano groan constrain hiding acoustics and charge final chain image as bridge/shackle; tactile chain handling evolves causally to mirror thematic yield.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rigid vs yielding engineering stake signaled early, deepens via blueprint realization; reveal to elders crystallizes stance under accumulative lens with hovering-fingers cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Encrypted compassion emerges via handwriting curves and blueprint, reweighting strength premise in final chain image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to "holding back" question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct machinist perceptual signature (glue ghosts, weld signatures) biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from dappled calm to charged reveal without distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via layered breath/tremble motifs without loops; minor figurative density purposeful, paying off in closure's "valley would breathe" without muddling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sly encryption in adhesive/handwriting transforms engineering trope into fresh compassion synthesis; lyric risk-taking charges closure image inevitably from particulars.</comment>
