<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Potter's zen traits compel micro-choices like embedding glass, with embodied thrum in palm revealing interior contradiction between ruin and aliveness; final renunciation of bowl earned by prior draws to fractures. Contradictory impulses act in scene (whispers to bee, shapes from memory) with visible cost of leaving creation behind.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of thrum/light motifs builds to CR closure in glowing bowl left amid fractures, reweighting resistance as remembrance with conceptual cost of unseen timelines; orientation anchored early in oasis, one tightening via glass-to-bowl integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains via sun patterns guiding potter and kiln heat pressing skin, charging final image of bowl among ruins; sensory hierarchy (honey ghost, acrid smoke) reflects POV bias toward alive fractures over graveyard label.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why resist change) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via bee's thrum deepening knowledge of overlaps, forcing endurance/renunciation of bowl with felt cost in unbroken shadow; agency in leaving crystallizes stance under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like lantern-embedded bowl recharging cracks as visible truths; final image ("resistance wasn’t refusal. It was remembrance") offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (time splits like wet clay, light bends stubbornly); rhythmic control modulates from patient tracing to insistent thrum under closing pressure, no elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (light/prisms, fractures) avoiding muddle, propulsion via varied syntax in peak (glass warms, clay drinks shard); zero loops, clean sequence in kiln rise to glowing bowl.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of potter shaping time-fractures via embedded memory-glass transforms wasteland tropes; risk in lyric CR heightens stakes of unnoticed wholeness, inevitable in hindsight from bee's gold dust.</comment>
