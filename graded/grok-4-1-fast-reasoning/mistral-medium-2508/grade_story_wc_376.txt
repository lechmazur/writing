<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's compulsion against lying manifests concretely in paling skin and stiff joints, driving the journey and culminating in earned raw writing at the pedestal; contradictory impulses peak when he pieces the map despite knowing he "shouldn’t have." Internal conflict layers beautifully through embodied reactions like trembling fingers and tightening throat, with closure renunciation of gilding feeling inevitable. Minor flaw: blind spots underexplored beyond compulsion, but doesn't touch pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of letter-images building to chorus of whispers and Conceptual Repricing at pedestal ("What did you come to say?"), with cost in worn plate and dry ink legible on-page. Shards (studio→tunnel→archive→return) taught early via zinc fragment, transitions legible, one tightening as whispers rise. Orientation anchors Veridion, Elias, post-oasis dusk by para 2; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains vividly: rusted chute squeezes entry, clutched zinc as shield, pulsing letters charge archive moment. Selective sensory hierarchy (damp earth, ink-soot handprints, copper haze) filters through calligrapher's eye, mirroring internal shift (groaning domes contrast lighter lungs). Final studio lamp recharges greenhouse roots motif, environment shaping closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confront silenced truths) signaled early via wilting trait, escalates accumulatively through map-piecing, tunnel handprints, letter-plucking to pedestal writing that forecloses gilding path. Agency in descent and pressing plate narrows options with felt cost (throat tightens, ink dry); one decisive deepening suffices. Minor: internal/external weave optional but coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truths-as-seeds emerges organically from bleeding ink, pulsing letters ("I stole..."), to final "words bleed" without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in tucked fragment and ungilded reread reweights premise, inviting ambiguity (new fragment unopened). Particulars like zinc anchor conceptual cost; no tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (words as veins/petals/breaths) biases toward calligraphic imagery, modulating rhythm under stress (short sentences in tunnel squeeze). Prose texture distinct: lyric compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping, elisions purposeful (map details).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers trembling as he traced the veins" advances character/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, paragraph cuts purposeful. Minor overwriting in archive metaphors ("curling like dying petals," "pulsing with...candor") risks density dip but pattern-taught and closure-clear; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of postal mythos, wilting curse, and whisper-archive transforms tropes (lost map→truth vault); risk in solo descent heightens stakes organically. Archive pedestal ("What did you come to say?") and smoothened plate feel inevitable, voice/setting cohere as singular vision without hedging.</comment>
