<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (trembling hands, burning watch) and earned shift from seeking unspoken words to voicing them, with micro-choices like tearing the page revealing values under pressure; subtle flaws in archetypal "dreamer" but motivation compels final letter-writing with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mist/watch visions build density to CR closure (she writes/seals letter, leaving watch); orientation anchors immediately (veiled dreamer in misted library); one tightening via second-letter vision chime forces sprint/escape with dissolving cost on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist/library shelves constrain choices (snagging veil, groaning ladder, collapsing inward) and charge final image (mist rolls but unafraid); selective sensory vividness (amber glow, parchment over bone, burnt sugar vision) mirrors internal urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (document before erasure) signaled early, escalates via density (vision snap, grinding gears, chime) under accumulative lens, narrowing to agency in tearing page/sprinting; cost legible in unraveling self and library loss charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken-to-spoken emerges via particulars (blooming ink, stolen page: "You were always the one who listened"); resonant CR ending reweights premise without moralizing, as letter seals non-literal answer to silence's gap.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (whispers/secrets as vapor); rhythmic prose modulates (short sprint sentences) under pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged final image without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "watch hummed... jerked counterclockwise"); figurative consistency (ink curling, velvet unspooling) pattern-taught without muddle; minor density in metaphors but no loops/artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal library/watch-cipher transforms time/regret tropes into inevitable CR (reverse arcs yield "say it" realization); risk in nonlinear dream-wake shard heightens stakes organically.</comment>
