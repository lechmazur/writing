<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between holding grief and sensing permeable connections acts in scanner use and laser pulse; final emotional release ("chest didn’t ache") earned by prior micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern density of glowing conversations tightening to CR closure; laser pulse and scanner abandonment reconfigure grief with on-page cost in "chest didn’t ache" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mycelium glow and permeable dome constrain mapping choices and charge final image of dissolved dawn edge; sensory selectivity (teal shadows, pressure reactions) mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping "conversations" deepens accumulatively via erratic sync to laser response, narrowing from technical fix to emotional release; cost legible in foreclosed grief hold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of permeable signals emerges organically from mycelium exchanges to final "doors that didn’t need opening," reweighting sister's death without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited third with perceptual signature of "unseen threads"; diction/rhythm modulate from quiet observation to charged pulse without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (breathing waves to birdsong swell); no loops, purposeful figures like "living circuit board" propel without muddle in peak laser beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fungal networks and grief via laser-mycelium interface transforms tech trope into emotional key; risk of quiet lyric closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
