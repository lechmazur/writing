<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in palm pressed to glass and stained fingers, with earned shift from painting to writing/leaving; lacks sharper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak revelation for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to CR closure in "the world was finally still enough to hear them," with legible conceptual cost of ceased chasing; glass shiver provides tightening without causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cathedral window and jasmine constrain revelation choice and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (cold seeping, scent thick) filters through Liora's priorities without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding bloom/silence) deepens accumulatively to realization with felt cost of renunciation in "She didn’t paint it"; one tightening via shivering glass suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of revelatory hush emerges organically from glass flowers and jasmine reprise, reweighting premise in final garden image without moralizing; postcard line integrates as character action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (petals breathing, glass shivering) modulates rhythmically; stable single POV, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but mild synonym churn (hush/quiet/silence) and minor paraphrase loops in repeated pavilion/flower closings dull late momentum without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reliquary glass and night jasmine transforms epiphany trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes via irreplaceable window reveal.</comment>
