<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via revelation density from tapestry to pillar to ledger, landing CR closure in the match strike and ashes where cost reconfigures the promise as mercy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archive's soot, cracked pillar, and groaning stone constrain choices and charge the final flames; desert wind erases footsteps, mirroring release in the ending image.</comment>
