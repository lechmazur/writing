<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to tune via unlearning drives micro-choices like pressing the fragment and closing her eyes, earning the internalized hum. Embodied emotions peak sharply in "breath hitched" and the absurd laughter post-shatter. Minor slip: internal conflict leans declarative ("peeling back layers") over simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in the tuning beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds from rust flakes to city resonance, culminating in CR closure where jumping reweights gravity as assumption with conceptual cost of discarded searching. Orientation anchors early (Elara at deck, perigee). Pivotal dish-shatter beat pays off taught pattern without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices: spiral stairs force ascent amid rust, cracked dish hosts tuning, gorge amplifies song and enables charged jump image. Sensory hierarchy (wind-snapping wires, electric hum) reflects Elara's perceptual bias. Final gorge-swallow recharges the radio city's skeletal decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hear universe's self-listening frequency) escalates accumulatively: crackle → chorus → internalized note → city harmony, narrowing via unlearning agency. Dish shatter forecloses external prop with felt loss, charging poise before jump. One decisive deepening suffices, cost legible in reversed assumptions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (beginnings disguised as ends, surrender over extraction) emerges organically from particulars like star fragment's forging echo. Final image answers via jump's "stupid, beautiful truth," reweighting search motif with resonant ambiguity. No moralizing; irony in mentor's chase internalized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: cosmic bias filters rust as "dying symphony," hum as "serenely electric." Rhythmic modulation accelerates in tuning beat (short sentences post-crackle). No head-hopping; elision of mechanics taught early, paid in bone-hum internalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory propulsion, e.g., "wires snapping... dying symphony" advances atmosphere/action. Purposeful lyric metaphors cohere (lightning gentle post-shatter), no muddle in climax. Minor repetition of "serenely electric" motif risks loop but patterns to closure charge; rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Hollywood Big Bang relic unlocks cosmic hush in derelict towers, transforming tropes via "fantasy practicality" (absurd laughter at resonance). Risky gravity-reversal turn inevitable from unlearning pattern. No derivative echoes; premise commits boldly to implications.</comment>
