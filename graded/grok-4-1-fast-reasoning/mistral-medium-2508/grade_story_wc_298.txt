<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's reckless idealism drives contradictory impulses—reckless trading vs. soul-weight endurance—culminating in earned renunciation of guilt via stitching, with embodied pain "sweet and bright as the first light of dawn."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of orchard imagery and barters builds to Charged Poise closure where roots weave guilt, reconfiguring her stance with legible cost in "holes in her soul didn’t ache... scars to carry"; orientation anchored early in catacomb orchard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains via roots that "pulled... at the thing she’d hidden deepest" and charges final image of orchard "watching, and waited, and was content"; selective sensory details like "air smelled of rain on dry earth" mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to barter guilt tightens accumulatively when roots pull her secret name, forcing endurance that forecloses past-dragging with cost in woven sorrow; agency in "needle flashed... pierced the card’s last embers."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of bartering scars emerges implicitly via orchard trades and final "past was in the earth now... future was in the walking," reweighting idealism without moralizing; white flower reprise shifts meaning non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing of roots/blossoms; voice modulates rhythm from "dusky resolve" to lighter close, dialogue sparse but subtextual in Veyra's accusation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, varied rhythm, but minor overwrite in repeated "somewhere" pattern at end slightly dulls closure image without obscuring; purposeful metaphors consistent, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh catacomb orchard premise transforms fate-bartering into visceral root-weaving; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via orchard's knowing pull.</comment>
