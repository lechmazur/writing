<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Queen's disenchantment and motivation root deeply in childhood bargain memory unspooling on-page, compelling her exquisite surrender; contradictory impulses peak in "She could run. She could scream. But... she dipped her hand," earning transformation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dreams to fireflies/teeth to starlight infusion, landing CR closure in "memory... kindest kind of bleeding" with undeniable conceptual cost of reframed bargain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "air tasted of copper and old magic" and thin air on ridge constrain climb; cobalt stone and smoldering veins charge final constellation image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel dreams) tightens via fireflies' turn to "violet glow sharpening into teeth," forcing queen's agency in hand-dip; pain as "thousand needles" makes cost visceral under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of trades/curses emerges organically via bleeding starlight motif shifting to "remembered" bargain; final "Now you see" reweights premise without moralizing, lingering with ambiguity for priests/queens.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in biased noticing (fireflies as "shared secret," then teeth); rhythmic prose modulates elegantly under stress, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (wound/bleeding/stars) without muddle, propelling to closure; rhythm varies naturally, e.g., short punches in "She could run. She could scream."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of omen/dream tropes into childhood-grotto bargain yielding constellation rebirth; risk in lyric menace pays off, transforming "hunger" into kind remembrance without retreat.</comment>
