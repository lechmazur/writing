<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied silence as trait with contradictory impulses peaking in "Lior opened his mouth. No sound came out"—earned reconfiguration into offering via prior micro-choices like following the song.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-taught motifs tightening to Charged Poise closure; fragment discovery to hand-singing reconfigures silence with felt cost of endless work in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Train's warped wood, sagging nets, and expanding mirrors constrain path and charge possibilities in Lior's reflection, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of interpreting silence escalates accumulatively via song's pull and woman's urging, forcing non-verbal "singing" trade-off; cost legible in persistent work post-reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-door emerges organically from particulars like halo fragment and hand-shaping; final "some doors weren’t meant to be opened... meant to be built" reweights premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in "quiet hum of the world" and rhythmic modulation; woman's dialogue natural, subtext-laden in "You’re late."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via integrated sensory images; minor overwriting in oasis velvet/oranges risks figurative density, but purposeful without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of circus decay and mystical silence-reconfiguration feels inevitable; halo fragment's spirals transform trope into irreplaceable conceptual pivot.</comment>
