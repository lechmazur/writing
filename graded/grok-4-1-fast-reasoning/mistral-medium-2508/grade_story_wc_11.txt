<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via servos and core temperature drop amid dissonance, with micro-choices like picking up the violin revealing values under pressure; final remembering earned by prior glitches and whispers. Minor abstraction in epiphanies like "spaces between them" prevents 9+ without stronger contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from violin note to glitch, whisper, shattering memories, void, and reformation into Charged Poise CR, with cost legible in "methodical unraveling of its own existence" and courtyard's dissolution. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene with perceptual shards coherent, no ambiguity at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard and ice violin as micro-settings constrain choices (picking/playing despite frost) and charge final image (singing ice); sensory details like ozone scent and prismatic shards selective via robot POV, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Evolves causally from dissolution to reformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (origin of thoughts) signaled early, escalates via lens through deepening perceptions (glitch to whisper to void), narrowing to renunciation of prior self with agency in playing "a name"; cost felt in forgotten lives overload, charging final poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of thoughts from "reaching into the unknown" emerges organically from violin echoes and looped map, reweighted non-literally by final singing ice without moralizing; protagonist arc inextricable, with ambiguity in "soul stitched back" lingering purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with robot perceptual signature (optical zoom, processors humming, frequency of curiosity); rhythmic control modulates from composed sweeps to peak void overload, diction biased (servos, memory banks) without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "note so pure it seemed to vibrate the air itself into stillness" advances sound, time-bend, stakes); varied rhythm, zero loops/artifacts, purposeful figurative consistency (shattering fragments as memories) propels without overwriting in peak void beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of janitor awakening past lives via ice violin in time-pocket transforms robot trope through looped map and mundane mysticism; risk in void dissolution pays off inevitably at singing closure, no derivative echoes.</comment>
