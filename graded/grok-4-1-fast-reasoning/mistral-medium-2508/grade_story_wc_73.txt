<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grim optimist trait drives micro-choices like hurling dice sideways and renouncing the door, earning final endurance with cost of accepting the chipped die. Contradictory impulses (capture vs. release texture) act in the leap and door moment. Backstory anchors via dice without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of climb and proof builds to chipped die's stutter as pattern break, delivering CR closure where staircase reconfigures from prison to choice. Cost legible in leaving smooth die on threshold. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via die throw suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Staircase and chipped die as micro-setting constrain leap and charge final image of reassembling steps. Sensory details (thudding boots, clatter, creak) selective and embodied. Gray haze peeling reveals door, mirroring internal rupture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing missed opportunity's texture) tightens accumulatively via creak and stuttering die, narrowing to door choice. Agency in sideways leap forecloses rewriting path with visible cost (smooth die left). Protagonist-driven under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of perpetual motion as choice emerges organically from die throw and door renunciation, reweighting premise in final climb image without moralizing. Dice motif charges closure non-literally. Complexity lingers in accepted flaw.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (textural/math lens: "texture of a missed opportunity," "proof aloud"). Prose rhythm modulates tension, compressing at climax ("She ran. Not upward, but sideways"). Distinct diction reflects mathematician's mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy climax sentences vs. flowing reflection); no loops or artifacts. Figuratives purposeful ("gray haze peeled back like fabric"). Propulsion clear, specifics replace generics (chipped edge biting palm).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math recursion, flawed dice, and infinite loop as chosen stasis transforms Escher-like trope. Risky abstract setting heightens ingenuity without gimmickry. Recursive revelation feels inevitable from established texture.</comment>
