<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's contradictory impulses—helping the widow while clinging to her own wreckage—act in scene via the locket turn, earning her endurance with embodied cost in the mother's reproach vision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure as Charged Poise in final silence/listening image reconfigures salvaging cycle with felt cost of impermanence, legible in "silence... wouldn’t last."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glacier shrine and snow globe constrain ritual choices, with groans pressuring visions; recurrent ice/cracks charge final image, mirroring internal salvage without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of salvaging purity tightens accumulatively via Lena's self-exposure after widow's vision, forcing trade-off with personal grief cost vividly felt in reproach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of pure salvage from breakage emerges organically via visions; final "cracks were how the light got in" non-literally reweights prior wreckage images with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of dead as "old silver" voices; dialogue subtextual ("That’s not him" thick with hope), rhythm modulates pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel; opening metaphor density ("glacier breathed... blue veins") risks slight overload but coheres texturally without closure muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Wreck-diver ghost-weaver premise transforms tropes via glacier-carved ritual; final crack/light synthesis feels inevitable, with bold lyric risks heightening stakes organically.</comment>
