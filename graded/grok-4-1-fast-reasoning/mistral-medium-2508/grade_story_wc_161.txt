<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in lying to Madame Holloway while tracing pigeon's wing, embodied in trembling hands steadying only for grain; final hum earned by prior causality of sending bird, with rusty voice as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dust/music/pigeon images builds to RR Charged Poise in pigeon's return and hum, reconfiguring silence-flinch to song-shape; cost legible in "rusty" notes and tucked relics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dust motes under skylight constrain pigeon routes via wind mapping and charge final image swirling "in time"; attic smells/textures tactile, mirror internal chaos-trust without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve echoes/reconnect tightens via meteorite-prompted pigeon send; agency in whispering route forecloses scatter-risk, cost felt in dawn-wait silence before return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rewriting trails emerges organically from ledgers-to-sheet-music arc; final hum/picked pen offers resonant non-literal answer to loss-preservation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with musical-rhythmic syntax ("wings cutting through dust-mote constellations"); dialogue subtextual in Madame Holloway exchange; perceptual bias via composer lens distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful simile pattern (sheet music/dust); no loops/artifacts, though fig lang heavy in reflective beats—propels without obscuring hum closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of composer-to-pigeon-trainer via dust-sheet-music, meteorite relic transforming loss-tropes; risk in lyric accumulative payoff feels inevitable in ledger margin smile.</comment>
