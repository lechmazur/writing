<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyssa's interiority is embodied and particular—teeth aching from sleeplessness, pendant's "hungry cold"—with contradictory impulses in hesitation before handing over the key, earning her release choice with visible cost to her guardian identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as atmospheric density builds from whispers to unraveling; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with "weight of words lifting from her bones" as legible conceptual cost of freedom, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen garden with mist anchors early and evolves causally—frost melting upward, ground to "breathing page"—constraining her wait and charging the final unraveling image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guarding vs. releasing tightens via figure's demand, her agency in handover foreclosing preservation path; cost felt in terror-as-home, pressure coheres accumulatively to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges organically from books' homesickness and final "darkness, but softer. Like a friend," reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature—surreal biases like "time had gone slippery"—modulates rhythm under pressure; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but figurative layering dense in peak ("light... thirsty") borders overwriting without muddle; no loops, clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of homesick books and uncertainty-as-friend transforms dimension-hopping tropes; bold surreal risks heighten closure without gimmickry.</comment>
