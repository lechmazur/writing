<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to curate stories intensifies credibly from locket hum to communal healing, with embodied reactions like pulse quickening and hands not shaking under pressure. Internal conflict between skepticism and belief acts in scene via pressing locket to ear. Community applies relevant pressure without overwhelming; earned stasis in listening forecloses solving mysteries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whispers and sounds density-build to mailbox opening and replies filling by noon as CR, reweighting forgotten things with healing cost legible in "grief and hope" mosaic. Orientation anchored early in courtyard/shop; single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity or debt; pivotal mailbox creak pays off supernatural hints with felt communal price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Courtyard at dawn (gold/rose light, jasmine/damp earth) selectively sensory and POV-biased via Mira's dusty fingers/glasses, constraining gate access and gathering shadows that charge final soft air. Recurring mailbox/rusted gate guides choices tactilely. Micro-setting locket constrains ear-pressing and pulses closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (E.L. mystery) signaled via initials/envelope, tightens accumulatively through locket photo/letter to communal replies, narrowing from personal curiosity to shared healing with foreclosed isolation cost. Agency in prying locket/envelope forces trade-off; one deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of listening over solving emerges organically from tick-tick, photo inscription, and mailbox replies, with final "space between stories where healing lived" as non-literal CR reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like neighborhood hum avoid platitudes; ambiguity in Elena's fate lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in "whispers bent time" and biased noticing (dusty fingers on tarnished silver); dialogue sparse/natural with subtext ("Open it"). Rhythm modulates dawn hush to noon pulse; no head-hopping, compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pulse quickening at E.L." advances stakes/character); rhythm varies read-aloud, openings diverse. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("slow exhale") but purposeful/consistent without muddle in peak (mailbox sigh). No loops/scaffolds; propulsion clear to chime.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh thrift-curator angle transforms ghost trope via locket/mailbox linkage growing from particulars, not template; risk in supernatural hum pays off in communal mending without gimmick. Final customer/box echoes organically, heightening stakes via endless curation.</comment>
