<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in building's whispers intensifies to signing with hesitation showing contradictory impulses; Veyra applies pressure through cryptic statements. Final inheritance of role earned by prior learning beats. Minor abstraction in emotions like "patiently nimble" but embodied in palm-pressing and staggering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of symbols (seals, letters in steam) builds to CR closure in cycle of tutor/new tenant, with cost in "some agreements were tombs." Orientation anchored early (brownstone, third-floor). One tightening at signing forecloses unchanged path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rooftop wisteria and meteor "sky writing" constrain lessons and charge final tea setup; bricks hum and exhale, mirroring internal states through tactile tracing. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (Elias hears creaks). Environment evolves with events, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn building's language) signaled early, tightens at blood-contract signing narrowing options; agency in interrogation "What did you do to her?" with building's grief as felt cost. Escalation via lessons to demand under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of lies as binding tombs emerges via contract and cycle, resonant in final "patient as the dead, nimble as a lie" reweighting inheritance without moralizing. Subtext in Veyra's disappeared solidity and seal's warmth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable Elias-limited POV with perceptual signature (buildings whisper, symbols bleed); voice rhythmic and textured ("wisteria vines curled like question marks"). Sparse dialogue subtextual ("you’ve come about the seal"), natural and advancing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy revelations amid poetic lines); metaphors consistent (mercury between ribs, sky's contract). No loops; propulsion peaks at "the brownstone exhaled." Opening/final lines recharge motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of haunted building as interrogable entity with tutor-cycle inheritance; transforms tropes via "language of old buildings" and seal's hum. Risk in poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight reprise.</comment>
