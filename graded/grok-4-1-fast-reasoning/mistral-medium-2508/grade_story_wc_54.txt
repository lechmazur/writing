<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's engineering traits drive micro-choices like tracing sextant patterns against schematics, revealing character through embodied calculation over emotion. Internal conflict is muted, but endurance in repurposing shows credible renunciation of full restoration. Final recalibration with foreman earns closure via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: sextant find → schematic alignment → hydroponics slot triggers flows, tightening to Charged Poise in bridge repurposing and "Hope = Flow × Resistance" equation. Orientation anchors early in terminal description. Closure cost legible in imperfect forward path over stars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Terminal's "corridors looped back on themselves" and hydroponics bay constrain navigation and enable key action, mirroring internal puzzle-solving. Sensory details like "faint scent of burnt sugar" and "stagnant, algae-thick water" filter through Lena's priorities. Final vane "pointing...the horizon" charges image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of terminal puzzle escalates causally via pattern reveal and flow activation, narrowing to trade-off in pedestrian bridge over spaceport revival. Agency in slotting and mapping forecloses fantastical escape. Cost felt in "didn’t fix the terminal... repurposed it."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hope as redirection emerges implicitly from carnival's theft of belief to water flows and bridge, reweighting premise in underlined equation without statement. Final kids at fountains offer resonant non-literal answer via clear water whisper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with engineering perceptual signature: "dismantling problems like rusted gears," modulating to stoic intensity. Foreman dialogue natural, subtextual in "I’m recalibrating." No head-hopping; diction controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies propulsion through action beats; high density in "valves groaned open, redirecting the water through forgotten channels." Minor metaphor density in opening but purposeful, no loops dulling closure image of creaking vane.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sextant unlocking hydroponics flows transforms abandonment trope into hope's engineering equation. Risk in maze logic and carnival contrast heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via terminal's "resurrecting" sigh.</comment>
