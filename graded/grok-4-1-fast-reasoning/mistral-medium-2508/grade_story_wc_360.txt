<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias's borrowed personalities create embodied contradiction, peaking in the chest storm when touching the halo, compelling his release of them with visible cost in self-dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to CR closure ("You were never the printer. You were the page."), with cost in fragment's dissolution reweighting his identity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Workshop's ink, topaz dust, and press constrain printing choices and charge the rising fragment's final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to decode emotion math tightens via ink-face reversal and emotion flood, forcing agency in release with cost legible in stars' reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of stars speaking feelings offers non-literal answer to borrowing's limits, reweighting empathy from capture to giving without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with perceptual signature (ink/topaz metaphors) modulates rhythmically to charged closure; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and purposeful figures; minor figurative density in peak build taught as voice without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of printing emotions and personality borrowing transforms tropes into inevitable CR; risk in halo's mirror-role heightens stakes organically.</comment>
