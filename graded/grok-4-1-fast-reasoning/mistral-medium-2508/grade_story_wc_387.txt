<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in Liora's frown and hesitant whistle mimicking Kael's, earning her final whisk pickup with visible cost of joining the hidden cycle; traits shown through specific micro-choices like counterclockwise stirring reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via pattern-building (nets, moon paths, whistle) holds through cadence shift to Charged Poise closure in "Liora picked up the whisk, and the cycle began again," with conceptual cost of hidden efforts framing the world legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Parapet moss, wet stone/mint, and breathing nets below constrain observation/whistle choices and charge final image of shimmering dark/nets; sensory hierarchy reflects Kael's pattern bias, evolving causally with night swell.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of revealing hidden patterns signaled in Kael's beliefs tightens accumulatively via Liora's whistle drawing minnows, forcing her stance crystallization with felt cost of pulse as "second, secret tide"; agency in joining whistle forecloses dismissal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden efforts as world's frame emerges organically from particulars like net grooves/lives and breathing nets, reweighting Liora's question in final cycle image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in pattern remaining post-dawn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with clean shift to Liora's embodied pulse thrum/perception; distinct perceptual signature in pattern-noticing (e.g., steam shapes "almost made sense") and rhythmic control heighten quiet pressure, dialogue subtextual ("Because the fish see").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in varying rhythms (e.g., short whistle beats amid lyric flow); zero loops/scaffold, purposeful figurative coherence like "tines splayed like startled spider" taught early without muddle in peak minnow reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of net-mending as philosophy with whistle summoning patterns transforms mentor trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens stakes via irreplaceable moon-path breath, inevitable in hindsight cycle closure.</comment>
