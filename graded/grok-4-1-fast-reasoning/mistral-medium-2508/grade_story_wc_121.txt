<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to conquer his splitting selves drives micro-choices like tracing the rune and lunging at the shadow self, earning the merger with embodied cost in searing runes. Contradictory impulses act on-page at the peak ("You always stop here" vs. lunge). Minor stock phrasing like "old coat" slightly limits peak specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: timeline fractures build density to sideways rewind and collision merger (RR with searing cost and lost version). Orientation anchored early (viaduct, rain, Elias). Closure cost legible in "tablet flared white-hot... crumbled to dust."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Viaduct slickness and shudder constrain steps/rewind; neon fractures mirror self-split and charge final vanishing image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis to tablet warmth and stone solidity. Evolves causally from rain-slick to solid road.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-conquest) tightens texturally via shadow confrontation, narrowing to lunge with agency and searing price. Escalation coheres: hesitation worsens to air pressing hungry, forcing merger. Cost unmistakable in lost eternal version.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of self-integration emerges via viaduct-as-labyrinth particulars, reweighted in final dawn walk and lingering lost self (resonant CR without moral). Returning drop/ripple shifts from threat to resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in time-fracture diction ("neon glow... fractured into jagged shards"); rhythmic control peaks in "shattering glass in reverse." Stable close-POV with shadow dialogue subtext fitting static voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (fractures knit like surgeon's wound). No loops; rhythm varies for tension (short peak sentences). Minor figurative density at opener purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms time-loop via procedural self-labyrinth and sideways rewind, inevitable in hindsight from tablet inheritance. Risky synthesis of procedural gen and personal conquest heightens closure charge.</comment>
