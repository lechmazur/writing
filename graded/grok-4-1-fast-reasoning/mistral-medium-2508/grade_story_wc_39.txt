<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied (chest ache, trembling hands, eyes burn), with contradictory impulses between hoarding sounds and sharing revealed in the girl's pivotal arrival. The earned shift to passing on feels motivated by prior causality, foreclosing isolation with relational cost. Minor epiphanic summary at end slightly dilutes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from solitary collection to girl's interruption, culminating in Charged Poise closure: unclenching and lighter loft reconfigure hoarding to sharing with legible emotional cost ("eyes burn"). Single scene fits scope; orientation anchored early in loft/dunes/dawn. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (sand creeping, brine scent, creaking beams) filter through Elias's priorities, constraining actions (sagging balcony, warped floorboards). Jar and music box as micro-settings charge closure image, mirroring internal shift. Atmosphere evolves causally with dawn's light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redemption via sounds tightens accumulatively with girl's arrival as pattern break, narrowing options from repair/hoard to share with felt cost (unclenched tension). Agency in handing jar/box forecloses isolation. Pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through letting go emerges organically from jars/music box particulars, reweighted in final sharing image without moralizing. Subtext in wistful echoes invites ambiguity on memory's bitterness. Protagonist arc inextricable from generational bridge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (sounds as sighs/promises); diction/rhythm modulate from solitary chill to warmed release. Brief dialogue natural, subtext-laden (girl's gasp advances stakes). No head-hopping; voice distinct from girl's idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs (short peaks in girl scene); high density integrates action/atmosphere. Purposeful poetic metaphors taught early avoid muddle, though minor figurative density in opener (−0.3). No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sound-jars as memory tech fresh synthesis transforms vagrant trope into generational bridge; risk in lyric texture heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Core premise inevitable in hindsight via dune song reprise.</comment>
