<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to revise history drives concrete micro-choices like covering mirrors and gripping the shard, with embodied emotion in his "hunger not for vengeance, but for revision" and lighter chest at climax; contradictory poet-revolutionary impulses act in scene. Dr. Taelis applies sharp pressure via accusation. Final acceptance feels earned by prior causality, though backstory block slightly abstracts early interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: time-strands, storm, shard build density to vision's twist and dissolution; single continuous scene fits defaults with on-page CR closure ("It isn’t history... It’s poetry") reweighting legacy, cost legible in shard-to-dust and archaeologists' uneasy exit. Orientation anchored early (Elias in cathedral on Lachrymae). No lens ambiguity; persistent shard constraint shapes tactics/final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid, time-strands, storm-charged particles constrain actions (glowing enables shard use, mirrors covered against splintering); cathedral evolves causally from ruins to reassembled murals in vision, charging final altar press. Sensory hierarchy (POV notices threads/shard warmth amid urgency) and POV bias (worship vs. data) vivid, selective; micro-setting (shard, altar) mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove Republic's poetic legacy vs. failed experiment) signaled early, tightens via shard activation/vision under Accumulative lens, narrowing options to self-destruction; agency in Elias's ritual forces Taelis's gasp/datapad drop. Cost unmistakable (shard dust forecloses further proofs, yet dispute ends). One decisive deepening suffices; moral calculus (revision over vengeance) sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (civilizations remembered, not excavated; time as poetry) emerges organically from shard vision and final image ("time... beautiful... his"), reweighting premise without statement; subtext in Taelis's accusation vs. Elias's smile invites ambiguity on "tampering." Resonance from particulars (strands, vase); protagonist arc inextricable, counter-readings plausible (success or delusion?).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Elias POV with perceptual signature (poetic noticing: "strands thick as rope, pulsing"); voice lyrical, rhythmic, modulates to intensity ("air... rippling like heat"); dialogue natural/subtextual ("I’m letting it speak") advances plot. No head-hopping; diction controlled, lyric compression taught early via backstory shards.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm syncing urgency (short sentences in vision: "The murals... bled color"); no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("forgotten jewel," "baroque spires") slightly muddles without harming closure; strong verbs/images propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible time, poet-revolutionary revising ruins via shard-storm ritual transforms tropes (failed utopia, artifact magic) into poignant CR; risk in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes, feels inevitable in "burnished sorrow" faces and final acceptance. No derivatives; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
