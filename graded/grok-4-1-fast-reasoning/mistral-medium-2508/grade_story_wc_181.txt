<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bewildered hunger drives micro-choices like pressing cameo to temple and stepping through door, with contradictory impulses (document vs. integrate) acting in orchard visions; final catalog entry earned by prior resonance, foreclosing destruction or full documentation with cycle-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of resonances (memory unspools → petal ink → engraving shift → door) culminates in CR closure via pistachio shell image reweighting inheritance cycle; cost legible in her face etched on shell, becoming the "next one."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Astral orchard constrains visions and door emergence while charging final pistachio shell; bathroom acoustics and graffiti anchor early thinking, with pollen equations and violet sap integrating causally into choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of inquiry tightens via engraving reversal ("Simply" to "Complicated"), forcing door-step with agency; under Accumulative lens, density reweights knowledge pursuit, cost in joining endless curator cycle unmistakable in shell image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance emerges via particulars (past curators, blooming questions), final shell-face reconfigures premise without moralizing; resonant answer to "dangerous" inquiry in her integration, embracing complexity of protected knowledge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature of archival hunger (etchings that "hurt to look at"); rhythmic control heightens pressure in mirror lag and orchard sighs, elisions taught early via spirals.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., petal-to-ink cascade); no loops, varied rhythm supports lyric accumulation, figurative coherence in fractal petals and pulsing roots without muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pistachio cameo unlocking orchard-library synthesizes artifact-taxonomy into resonance-cycle ingeniously; risk of nonlinear visions pays off in hindsight-inevitable shell-face, transforming forbidden-knowledge trope.</comment>
