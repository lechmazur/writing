<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Chen's interiority shines in embodied details like trembling hands and brush-dipping tied to grandmother's inkwell, revealing orchestration worldview; micro-choices under pressure (copying specs to fortune slip) earn final departure with felt cost of leaving lighthouse life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fortune motifs and secrets layer density to Charged Poise closure on train ("transposing life into a new key"); one tightening at daughter's knock narrows options with legible cost (lighthouse silence as warning); orientation anchored early in study scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse study (brass-lined, Fresnel lens beam "slicing dark") and inkwell constrain choices like copying specs; sensory hierarchy (damp ink, dripping oilskin, incense smoke) filters through Chen's priorities, charging final beacon-turn image with evolved environmental cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchestrate microdot handoff amid pursuit) signaled early, tightens via knock ("They're coming") forcing agency in directing daughter; under Accumulative lens, density reweights with conceptual cost in departure, though physical price felt more than visibly paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets emerges organically from fortune particulars (e.g., "The hum you ignore will one day sing your name") reweighted in final train image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to orchestration vs. fate via "echo for the voice" realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (fortune-like phrasing, light/sea motifs); minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("He'll know what to do"); rhythmic control modulates from poised reflection to charged poise without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful fortune recurrences avoiding loops; varied rhythm (short punchy closures vs. flowing descriptions) propels without muddled metaphors; minor scaffold in repeated "somewhere" phrases but no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-writing spycraft in lighthouse isolation transforms tropes via "open secrets" logic; risk in poetic Accumulative layering heightens enigmatic stakes, inevitable in hindsight via train reprise.</comment>
