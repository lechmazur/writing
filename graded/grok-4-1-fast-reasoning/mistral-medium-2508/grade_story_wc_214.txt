<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (breath fogging glass, calloused hands tracing stars) roots motivation in spiritual curiosity; earned change from isolation to witness via star connection. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("strength wasn’t in armor") slightly abstracts peak realization without full contradiction in impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from routine cleaning to star hesitation and integration; closure as Charged Poise RR in lantern healing and departure, with legible cost ("risk of being broken") at alarm moment. Orientation anchored early; single tightening via lingering star suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Station dome and lantern glass vividly constrain choices (tracking star, bending light) and charge final image (lantern whole, pulsing in agreement). Sensory hierarchy (vibrations, ozone scent) filters through Eli's perceptual patience; purposeful cosmic specificity avoids white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of connection in stillness tightens accumulatively through meteor sigh to star's pulse and Eli's agency (whispers "I see you," ignores alarms); forecloses isolation path with vulnerability cost. Escalation coheres under lens without need for reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of flourishing stillness emerges organically from particulars (lantern cracks healing, star veins in walls); final image resonates non-literally as invitation accepted. Minor slip in closing statements ("The end was never the point") borders thematic echo, reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close holds stable POV with cosmic perceptual signature (stars' "ghostly heat," light as vines); rhythmic modulation builds to peak whisper. Minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven ("I see you"); purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels accumulatively; sensory propulsion integrates action (palm to dome). Minor deduction for repetitive "stillness" echoes and dense figs in peak (light "climbing like vines") bordering overwrite, but pattern purposeful and closure clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic janitor tending silence transforms isolation trope via lantern-star communion; risk-taking in lyric sci-fi heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration (station breathes) feels inevitable from established stillness pattern.</comment>
