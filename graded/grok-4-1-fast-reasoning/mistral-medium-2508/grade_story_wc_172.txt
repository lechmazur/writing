<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (greed in drought vs. mourning bird) act simultaneously in embodied micro-choices like trembling fingers withdrawing the egg; final renunciation earned by prior causality with legible conceptual cost in "enough."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to on-page CR (egg placement reconfigures scarcity legacy); cost legible in "absurd, pointless—no one would ever know," foreclosing amoral path with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Salt flat constrains choice (cracks map path to fissure cradle) and charges final image (salt seals like scar); sensory details (brittle crust under boots, wind whispering shell) filtered through Elias's biased perception of veins/maps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scarcity empire vs. release) deepens accumulatively to egg placement, narrowing options with agency in renunciation; cost unmistakable in pointless worship against his masterpiece drought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image (salt scar, echo wingspan) offers resonant non-literal answer to scarcity-thesis, reweighting drought/confession without moralizing; emerges organically from particulars like cracks spelling "enough."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (cracks as veins/maps) and rhythmic control modulate with intensity; stable close-third POV with clean focalization, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "warm as a secret" advances character/atmosphere); zero loops/artifacts, varied rhythm propels to charged closure image without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of amoral drought-baron's egg-confession transforms philanthropist trope; risk in lyric CR (stubborn note vs. silence) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
