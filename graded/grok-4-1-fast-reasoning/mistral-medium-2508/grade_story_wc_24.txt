<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses—superstitious ritual versus Bureau rationality—act simultaneously in the key-turning despite anomaly signs; final release earned by father's lore and embodied dread in "fingers trembled."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as anomaly density builds from wavering horizon to ship lurch and black water; CR closure via notch realization carries conceptual cost of imperfect gates.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hydraulic pipes vomiting black water constrain climax choice and charge final oiled-gears image; sensory hierarchy narrows to burnt copper and scythe pendulum under crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of anomaly containment escalates via protagonist's counting agency, forcing trade-off release with cost in shuddering clock and persistent notch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Notch discovery reweights clocks-as-choosers premise non-literally, answering gatekeeper realization with lingering ambiguity of tomorrow's count.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "fragile seams where seconds split into possibilities" modulates rhythm under dual-existence stress without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action-image like "ship’s bow split the horizon like a needle through silk"; zero loops, propulsion peaks at self-turning key.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Steampunk temporal bleeding transforms anomaly trope; risk in ritual counting yields inevitable notch as fresh synthesis.</comment>
