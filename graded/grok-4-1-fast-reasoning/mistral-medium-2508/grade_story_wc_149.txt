<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in love/grief compels Liora's excavation-like returns with embodied cost; contradictory impulses shine in her chisel/mallet metaphor driving micro-choices. Keeper's bark-hands and venomous remark add pressure without stereotypes. Final unraveling earns renunciation, but ethereal distance slightly abstracts raw flaws in peak dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to RR closure: bead crumbles ("Its song died"), Liora's veil unravels, orchard echoes—clear before/after with felt cost in temporary dawn slash. Orientation anchors early (greenhouse, bead, orchard). One tightening via tree-split awakening suffices; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse's frost-weeping glass, silver-throated nightshade constrain Liora's cameo touches and bead burial, charging final humming vines image. Sensory hierarchy (petals crumbling voice, rotting roses scent) reflects ghostly urgency. No white-room; lived-in via keeper's sap vial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resonant awakening) signaled early, tightens texturally as cameos cost essence, culminating in agency-driven rise/unraveling with visible price ("thread by thread"). Pressure coheres to Charged Poise; keeper's secondary pressure relevant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Debt/resonance theme emerges organically from bead's pulse to crumbling echo, reweighting awakenings as loving/venomous cycles without moralizing. Final slash of dawn heals "backward," offering non-literal answer to eternal hunger with lingering ambiguity. Particulars (thorned ribs, carved names) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Liora's perceptual signature (smoke through keyhole, petals crumbling voice); rhythmic modulation peaks in tree-split creak. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Again?" / "Almost."). No head-hopping; keeper segment coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: vivid syntax varies (short punchy climax lines). No loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (wound healing backward). Minor figurative density in opening risks slight slowdown, but closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostly alchemy/resonance transforms tropes (bead as dowry-thief pulsing lover's breath); risk-taking in lyric awakenings inevitable via orchard's memory. No derivatives; bold eternal debt cycle heightens stakes cleanly.</comment>
