<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysander's lie ("I’m not here to fight") followed by lunge reveals contradictory impulses under pressure, earning the final clasp choice with visible cost in new hunger. Interiority concrete via advisor echoes and embodied actions like palm to mirror. Flaw: advisor off-page limits relational crucible, but single-POV coherence holds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of cursed images builds to filmstrip pull as Resonant Reconfiguration, reweighting fear with cost in clasp's "new kind of hunger." Orientation anchored by ~100 words; single scene spirals coherently to charged poise closure. No micro turns dilute; pivotal yielding mirror pays off disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Funhouse mirrors constrain entry/climax (yield, absorb, weep silver) and charge puddle reflection finale. Sensory hierarchy (burnt sugar/copper, razor-glass voice) filters via Lysander's cursed perception, evolving causally with shudder. Micro-object (dream dictionary) guides tactic, mirroring internal unraveling without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbosom fear-self) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative density to lung-through reversal narrowing options; agency in filmstrip pull forces trade-off with felt clasp hunger. Thing's chorus voice deepens pressure coherently. Cost unmistakable in unspooling moments and final wink.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (fear as self-deception) emerges via advisor quotes/images shifting at "fear is the hand that thinks it’s holding the flashlight," culminating in non-literal wink repricing premise. Subtext in lie/lunge invites ambiguity without confusion; final image reweights stolen life-frames organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct surreal perceptual signature (faces "smear of light," mirrors "breathe") biases via cursed POV; rhythm modulates from setup to clipped climax ("He lunged. Not at it—through it"). Sparse dialogue subtextual ("why are you armed with a whisper?"); no head-hopping, distance tightens under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer image/action (e.g., "fingers sinking into its chest like wet paper") without loops; rhythm varies for ear (short peak sentences). Minor figurative density in opener ("dawn broke like a bruise") purposeful under taught pattern, not muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of photographic curse/filmstrip heart transforms funhouse trope into inevitable self-trickery; risk in surreal physics (rippling mirror, weeping silver) heightens stakes without gimmick. Final "stolen stars" and "Next" inflect fresh, hinging on clasp's evolution.</comment>
