<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's haggard curiosity—embodied in rough fingers prying the brooch and ignoring the "should've turned back"—compels contradictory impulses that earn his final painting as an offering, foreclosing blank horizons with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from brooch find to cavern vision; closure RR/CR lands on-page with brooch's warm return and straight rain reconfiguring island agency, cost legible in his transformed dreams.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rain trails and salt-cracked mud constrain path to chapel; crooked-to-straight rain charges final image, mirroring internal shift while bioluminescent veins evolve with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to thresh meaning tightens via vision's convergence, protagonist agency in exchange/exploration drives under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in becoming the island's offering, felt in dream mercy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity awakening scarred place emerges implicitly from brooch-as-offering; final warm brooch/straight rain offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting prior isolation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with painterly perceptual signature ("light fractured on water"); wry diction/rhythm ("dry, wry sound") modulates under pressure, woman's dialogue subtextual and sparse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with no loops/artifacts; metaphors consistent ("wound scabbed," "canvas drank colors") propel without muddle, rhythm varies to charge "tide carrying mercy."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-wars tidal ruin and amber convergence transforms artifact trope; risk in lyrical shards heightens island's agency without obscuring Charged Poise closure.</comment>
