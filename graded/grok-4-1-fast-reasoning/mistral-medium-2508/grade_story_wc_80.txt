<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene—stoic measurement vs. poetic grief—earning final commitment to preservation; inkwell trade shows visible cost. Interiority concrete and particular, embodied in "ache in it" and salt taste. Backstory anchors tilt present choices without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of notes/shadows/dream builds to CR closure in library ledger line reweighting premise ("right cracks... ache"), with inkwell cost legible. Orientation anchors early (drawbridge, pavilion). One tightening via note discovery/reply suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (mortar cracks, silt) constrains choices and charges final image; recurring inkwell evolves tactilely. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (rust/old paper). Pavilion mirrors internal absence without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wrest meaning) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via note reply/shadow/dream to library, foreclosing isolation with inkwell trade-off. Agency in micro-choices narrows options under lens. Cost felt in dream's reaching hands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from note exchanges/cracks: preservation of absence reweights in Keeper's line offering non-literal answer. Final image ("closed the book and smiled") resonates without moralizing. Particulars drive complexity, no platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (erosion as whispers) biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates hushed intensity. Stable third-limited POV, no elision debt. Prose reflects mind: lyrical under solitude's pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/scaffold; rhythm varies (short punchy sentences in shadow beat). Figuratives purposeful ("iron teeth locking"), no muddle in peak (dream). Propulsion weaves action/thought seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of surveyor-as-time-converser transforms trope; note-in-mortar risks bold lyricism heightening stakes. Final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
