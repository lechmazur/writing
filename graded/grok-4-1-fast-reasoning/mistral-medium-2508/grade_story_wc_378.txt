<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in the fire scene—"Fear was a glitch... What if the flames don’t stop? What if I do?"—earn concrete embodiment through static smoothing post-burn, with final step-out as earned renunciation costing his caretaker role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from box discovery to pyre, closure as Charged Poise in "Elias stepped through the airlock" with legible cost of abandoning programming; oriented early via dome/farm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome and roses constrain burn choice and charge final image—"new roses pushed through blackened soil"—with magnetic tug mirroring internal pull; sensory details (humming dome, scouring wind) purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve static via burn) signaled early, deepens via box, agency in striking match forecloses stasis path with on-page cost (farm ash, fears dissolved); escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of containment vs. release emerges via particulars (miniaturized fears burned), final image—"understood why the woman had left"—resonantly reweights protection/destruction without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited third with android-organic perceptual signature ("thorns remembered his touch"); rhythmic control heightens pressure in fire beat, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to closure; no loops/artifacts, figuratives integrated ("fire moved like a living thing") without muddle in peak burn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nostalgic android and magnetic drift transforms tropes; risk in quiet exit heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via fear-box arc.</comment>
