<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solid interiority via embodied details like calloused fingers tracing prism and breath fogging glass; motivation rooted in daughter's memory anchors endurance. Lacks overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning toward serene observation over crisis-driven tension. Micro-choices like selecting stone reveal values without full safety-hedging flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light/ripple patterns builds to Charged Poise/CR closure where atrium pulses and Elias turns to day, reweighting mundane with felt cost of daughter's absence and daily ritual. Orientation anchored early (Elias at dock, dawn). No causality breaks; ritual constrains final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atrium as micro-setting constrains ritual choices and charges final glow/pulse; sensory details (salt-damp glass, mist curling boots) filtered through glazier's perceptual bias. Vivid evolution with tide/mist; spatial choreography coherent. Environment mirrors internal poise, avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminating mundane via ritual) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through ripple readings foretelling tide/wind and personal breath's steadiness. Agency in stone-throw/communion tightens pressure subtly; cost felt in endurance amid loss. Quiet escalation fits lens but lacks sharper option-narrowing turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (attention reveals slow meaning in mundane) emerges organically from prisms/ripples/daughter's memory, culminating in resonant final pulse answering "is it magic?" via non-literal image. Subtext in fleeting shapes invites ambiguity without confusion. No moralizing; complexity lingers in harbor's forgetfulness vs. Elias's knowing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in light/ripple metaphors ("silent language," "noctilucent reckonings"); rhythmic control modulates contemplative build to charged end. Stable close-third POV with character-specific noticing; purposeful lyric compression legible under lens. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., stone sigh spreads ripples intersecting light); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds. Figures purposeful and consistent (mist as lung, blade through silk), no muddle in peak ripple-reading. Propulsion aligns with scene's quiet intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glazier ritual reading ripples/prisms transforms mundane harbor life into textured mysticism; daughter's blurred world primes non-obvious "paying attention" reweighting. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes of perception without gimmickry. Organic details avoid templates.</comment>
