<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Coachman's motivation to heal the land is embodied in rough hands cradling pods and whispering *Grow*, with endurance shown in returning despite poor sleep; contradictory impulses subtle in knowing no mercy yet whispering old words. Interiority particular via battlefield memories tasting iron. Final persistence earned with felt cost of his eventual quiet bones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density layers from seed-scattering to dreaming of roots in rifle barrels to years-later garden; CR closure in "the garden would remember" reweights healing with conceptual cost of persistent memory. Orientation anchored by ~50 words in jetty/twilight. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Jetty's slick stones and tide constrain scattering, lapping eagerly at dust; recurring birds/reef graveyard filter through coachman's squint, charging final "jetty glowed at twilight" image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to salt/silt under crisis of land's hunger. Evolving details mirror internal states without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of land's hunger for roots signaled early, escalates accumulatively via bird-guided scattering to dream-vengeance tightening options toward persistence; cost in poor sleep and his shadow-bones legible. Agency in micro-choices like mimicking tern. No reversal needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of green vengeance over war emerges from pod-dust drifting to poppies leaning seaward; final CR image "garden would remember" resonantly reweights reclamation without moral. Complexity in land feasting on blood yet needing roots lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature in wind-carved face and bird-mimicry; rhythmic prose modulates from curled syllables to insistent chatter. No head-hopping; diction biased to silt/drowned things. Purposeful compression in shards pays off legibly at CR.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density in lines like "syllables curling from his throat like smoke from damp kindling"; varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density (e.g., broken rib jetty) coherent, no muddle in peak scattering beat. Clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coachman-seed ritual transforming battlefield tropes via bird concord and pod-hum; risk in lyric shards heightens reclamation stakes. Final garden-memory inevitable from pod-whispers. No derivatives; bold narrow-vast tone inflects organically.</comment>
