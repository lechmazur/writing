<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of cool-headed endurance in unflinching actions like leaning into the mouth and voicing silence as command; contradictory grief (daughter's memory) acts simultaneously with resolve, earning final stasis of carrying/releasing her voice without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density rising from restless garden to spike striking hollow mouth and command silencing it; on-page Charged Poise closure ("echo remained... let it bleed") reconfigures meaning with cost in blackened stems and pocketed spike's burn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sound wave garden as micro-setting constrains digging to silent soil and charges final sigh/hum; recurring stems sway/blacken, mirroring internal silencing with tactile specificity like "teeth made of broken echoes."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of banishing false daughter's echo tightens texturally via pattern break (zigzagging stars stutter) to command narrowing options; fisher's agency in driving spike forecloses goddess with visible cost (blackened stems, carried voice).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of selective echoes emerges organically from particulars like goddess mouth whispering name and fisher letting one "drown"; final dock image ("smiled. It smiled back") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting pursuit without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in sonic bias ("voiced silence," "frequencies settling"); rhythmic control modulates from humming tension to held-breath poise, heightening pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figures ("sky bled frequencies," "air split like wet silk") taught early and propelling to climax; zero loops, varied syntax accelerates to "The dark rushed in, hungry and familiar."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic fishing and echo-goddess transforms myth into fisher's lived grief; risk in surreal mouth confrontation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via spike/net tools.</comment>
