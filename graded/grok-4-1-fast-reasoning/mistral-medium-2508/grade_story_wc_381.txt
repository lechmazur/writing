<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solitary summoner's motivation to hush prophecy drives ritual micro-choices like shaping the silence net; embodied contradiction in lunging failure yet earning rest. Interiority concrete via hollow-eyed stare and searing skin. Minor abstraction in final epiphany slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ripples to snap reversal, reconfiguring prophecy from scream to sigh (Charged Poise RR with searing cost). Single scene anchored early by brook/POV. Closure cost legible in "tattered, glowing thing—drifted back... lighter... quiet."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brook constrains key choice (press wing, stills surface) and charges final image (sings secrets, carries shadow). Sensory hierarchy selective: water's hush, moss cheek, moonlight edges. Mirrors internal softening without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush unraveling prophecy) signaled early, tightens via snap/thread escape narrowing to earned stasis. Agency in hands' patterns; cost felt in skin sear and solitude press. Lens escalation: pattern break reweights with lighter wing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of fears hushed via silence emerges organically from wing/net actions; final "hush was hers... perfect" reweights prophecy premise non-literally. Complexity in partial failure lingering as sigh. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in hush/ripple code; rhythmic modulation peaks at snap, compresses in closure poise. Prose texture distinct: "flow, a current of images." No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful hush motif; rhythm varies, propulsion syncs breath/brook. Minor overwriting in repeated "tranquil blaze" but pattern-taught. Closure image clear, no loops obscuring snap/return.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami ritual mapping silence to hush cosmic prophecy; lyric risk heightens stakes in reverse-unfold lattice. Inevitable in hindsight from brook/whispers setup. Bold tonal blaze transforms tropes.</comment>
