<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Courier's jittery traits embodied early in trembling fingers and lingered encounters, compelling the climax rip of the pendant; woman's enigmatic pressure forces relational shift. Internal conflict surfaces in lied excuse vs. hope for key, earning final non-trembling hands. Minor epiphanic summary ("he understood") slightly undercuts prior causality at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pendant thrum to vine-song unraveling aurora, culminating in CR where courier plants seed, reweighting mentor's absence as extension with conceptual cost of self-fade. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coheres with one deepening (woman's demonstration). Closure image of germinating promise charges before/after legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ridgeway's crumbling path and abyss constrain steps and climax weave; aurora's pulse filters through POV urgency, narrowing to vibrations. Frost symbols and wind pebbles integrate tactilely into action. Recurring fade/abyss charges final bridge and seed-planting image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find/coax hum signaled early via mentor's instruction; accumulative escalation via seed-crush to airborne bridge narrows routine into vast weave, forcing stance crystallization. Protagonist agency in ripping pendant and stepping/planting pays cost of dissolution. One tightening sufficient, cost felt in merged shadows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as passed hum emerges from germinating particulars (seeds to stories/bridge), reweighting routine via courier's arc without statement. Final seed-press offers non-literal answer to "find what hums," lingering ambiguity in cycle's promise. Subtext in woman's softening voice and dissolution avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable, perceptual signature in vibrational synesthesia (thrum into bones); voice modulates rhythmically from tense steps to charged poise. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You’re late," "He extended"), distinguishing idioms. Patterned elision (fade motifs) taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (fragments like "It was waiting"); intentional hum/vibrate recurrence pattern-taught without loop. Minor figurative density ("threads of gold," "tremor before the bloom") in climax risks muddle but supports textural lens. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh mythic synthesis: seeds germinate stories, courier dissolves into ridgeway's song, transforming absent-mentor trope via vibrational physics. Risky lyric compression inevitable in hindsight, heightening cycle stakes without gimmick. Bold final curtain-split rewards prior particulars.</comment>
