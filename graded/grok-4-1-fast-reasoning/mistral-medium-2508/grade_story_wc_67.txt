<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in burning the portrait upon "finally understood him too well," earning the cycle endurance with mask's biting cost; interiority particular without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening to chair's stop and powder exhale; Charged Poise closure in "The portrait’s ghost shimmered... She left it there" reconfigures endless weaving with legible cycle cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vanishing point and mask shards constrain illusory creation, charging final ghost; damp plaster and refracted light patterns filter through Liora's bias, mirroring internal fractures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake to crystallize fleeting via destruction deepens when burning due to understanding, narrowing to renunciation; pattern break at chair stop forces stance, with cycle cost felt on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mirage theme emerges organically from ash/powder illusions, answered non-literally in patrons' misrecognition and her departure; no moralizing, complexity in truth-as-unsaid lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature in "fractured patterns... like a code" biases to illusions; rhythm modulates from creak to silence without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm—"powder slipped... like the first snow on a grave"—no loops or muddle; minor reflective abstraction purposeful for lyric texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ash-weaving as anti-preservation transforms artist trope; mask from teacup and vanishing point synthesis feels inevitable, risking cycle closure boldly.</comment>
