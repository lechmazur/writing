<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional Elias particularity via voice-raised whispers tolerance and micro-choices like plucking father's name under pursuit pressure; contradictory belief/drive sustains climb without epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density from whispers to lattice unfolding; CR closure in blue flicker/name pluck legible with "they were coming" door creak cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Jagged reef and lattice constrain climb/unfolding choices; copperlight to blue beam shift charges final image, sensory hierarchy vivid via Elias bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to rewrite story deepens accumulatively from lattice stick to name pluck, forcing grin/renunciation trade-off; creak and turning tide make pursuit cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Father's name amid thief/warden reweights lie/truth cycle premise; final grin "This time, it’s yours" resonates ambiguously without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct poetic signature ("throat of the sea," "parchment-thin truth") biases perception via Elias; sparse whispers carry subtext, stable single-POV under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density propels climb ("hush... between a held note and a scream"); varied rhythm/syntax peaks clean at unfolding without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lattice-name unfolding ingeniously transforms wolf-lie trope into echo-reweaving; risk-taking poetic shards heighten stakes, inevitable in hindsight grin.</comment>
