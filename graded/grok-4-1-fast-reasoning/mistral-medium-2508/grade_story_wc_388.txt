<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's skepticism drives concrete micro-choices like piecing letters and pressing the diamond, earning his final refracted reflection; internal conflict between disbelief and patterns feels embodied without therapy-speak. Minor backstory block early anchors present but briefly slows momentum before pit discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from orchard entry to stillpoint pushback to ground split, landing CR closure in "the stillpoint wasn’t hiding the curse... it was hiding the cure" with Elias's absorption as conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early in wasteland orchard; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard's glowing fruit and glass shards constrain choices (boots crunch, fingers sticky with sap) and charge final fruit on truck; sensory hierarchy sharpens via Elias's goggles-smeared gaze under fallout twilight. Details evolve causally from thriving roots to split ground.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (excavate truth) deepens accumulatively via stillpoint images narrowing skeptic worldview; agency peaks in kneeling to "turn the key," foreclosing debunking path with light-taking cost. One tightening sufficient, pressure coheres to reweight "curse" as cure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of lies as fertilizer emerges organically from orchard images shifting to garden/cure; final heartbeat fruit offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting conspiracies via "every lie he’d ever debunked had been fertilizer."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias (patterns over curses); rhythmic prose modulates from observant entry to laughing tremor, distinct texture in "ozone, maybe, or the ghost of static." Radio voice brief, distorted subtext fits.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels from wind howl to uncoiling green; no loops, but minor figurative density ("unspooling," "refracted") in revelation beat risks slight overwrites without muddle. Clean grammar, strong verbs throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of conspiracy tropes into thriving wasteland garden/cure, with flawed diamond as valve reweighting premise; risk in CR twist inevitable from patterns and stillpoint, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
