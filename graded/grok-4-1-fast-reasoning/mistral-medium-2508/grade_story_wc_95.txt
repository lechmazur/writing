<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (answers vs. destinations) act in the duel, earning the partnership choice; mechanical arm sparks reveal Elias under pressure. Interiority concrete (pulse quickens at coded overture). Final grip meets callouses/brass as visible relational reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: needle card slap → intercept/embed → revelation → center strike unlocks key with partnership DC. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (atrium, sundial, waiting). Closure cost legible in foreclosed rivalry at "partners" turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sundial's half-painted angles and needle shadow constrain fencing choices, charging key reveal. Brook/heron mirror waiting, integrated tactilely (damp earth, crushed mint). Sensory hierarchy fits duel urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (verdict rivalry) tightens via revelation ("I carved the code"), narrowing to partnership agency. Sparks/clash escalation causal under lens; cost in curdled patience felt before key.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (doubt to map/partnership) emerges from sundial code, reweighted in final silhouettes as unfinished argument. No moralizing; resonance from particulars like shadow-split VII/VIII.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable Elias-limited POV with perceptual bias (gears whisper, light paths). Dialogue subtextual ("brook waits"), distinct voices (Elias corrective, Liora laughing blade). Rhythmic control heightens clashes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "needle card spinning like thrown coin embeds exactly"); no loops, varied rhythm. Figurative coherent (shadows as diamonds/maps), no muddle in peak strike.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: philosophical fencing via coded sundial transforms rivalry trope. Risky poetic diction heightens ingenuity without obscurity; inevitable partnership from angles.</comment>
