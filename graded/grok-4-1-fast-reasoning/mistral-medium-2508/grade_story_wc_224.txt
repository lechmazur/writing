<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction between suppressed talent and resurfacing call, embodied in mercury eyes churning to storm; final Keeper choice earned via stone's mirror of past selves. Micro-choices like tracing feather reveal values under pressure. Minor reflection anchors cleanly without flattening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of revelations (glyph map, page-seed) builds to CR closure as Elias writes truth, reweighting buried self with cost of prior suppression legible in "hollows inside him." Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mountain-bookstore constrains search (false wall in Poetics of Silence) and charges final image (shelves trembling, dust as stars); sensory details like warm pulsing stone mirror internal hollows. Vivid, selective, POV-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (address painful buried talent via stone) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as mirror forces embrace; agency in seeding page forecloses hiding with cost felt in mountain's groan and sealed door. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of planting unspoken language/home emerges organically from glyph-seed, Keeper ledger; final image of writing onto shelves reweights prior motifs non-literally, embracing cost of refusal without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (ripples in air, shifting glyphs); stable close third-person POV modulates rhythm to pressure peaks like "mercury turning to storm." Compression taught early, legible payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels (e.g., short punchy actions in climax: "tore the page free, folded it into a seed"); coherent metaphors (mountain throat, feather breath), no loops or artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seer in living-book mountain transforms buried-talent trope via plantable language; glyph-seed turn inevitable from feather-map setup, bold lyric risks heighten stakes coherently.</comment>
