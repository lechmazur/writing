<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's interiority shines in embodied conflict between fixing ("sage of broken things") and releasing, culminating in the earned pulse-sync choice that forecloses his old life with felt cost. Contradictory impulses act on-page as he climbs despite ache, revealing values hierarchy. Minor epiphanic phrasing ("perfect truth") doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from clock spin to turret touch, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure: "he finally matched its rhythm" reconfigures constancy, cost legible in "didn’t try to catch them." Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early ("lunar observatory... thirty years"). No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "silvered domes" and "thin... air" constrain climb and charge final image of "domes now cradling... truth." Sensory hierarchy (hum, wind, shadows) reflects Elias's priorities, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (spinning hand) shapes pivotal touch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix or harness change) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shudders to sync, narrowing options with agency in "reached out... matched." Cost unmistakable in release ("let go") altering his path. One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of constancy-as-motion emerges organically from leaf/star images shifting meaning, resonant CR in final "sky... welcomed him home" reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like cameras capturing time drive arc. Minor near-explicitness ("single, perfect truth") avoided full penalty as image-led.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature: shadows reveal "shape of his own life." Rhythmic prose modulates from groan to "singing," compression purposeful under lyric mode. No head-hopping, elision pays off in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm; metaphors cohere (hand as "question," world "stilled" via sync) without muddle in peak touch beat. Minor paraphrase loops ("spinning hand" reprises) patterned, not templated; no filter stacks or scaffold dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of repairman epiphany via cosmic clock transforms time-trope into "move with it" via observatory logic. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early hand spin to launchpad image. No derivative hedging.</comment>
