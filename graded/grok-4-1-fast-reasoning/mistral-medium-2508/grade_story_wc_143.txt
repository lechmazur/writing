<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in purposeful curiosity drives micro-choices like planting the canister and repeated photos, with embodied ache in chest and fogged helmet revealing internal conflict. Earned endurance in departing with photos forecloses wonder's permanence, scaled to length. Minor slip in reflective summaries like "longing to understand what was lost" borders on unearned epiphany without full contradiction in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of glows, photos, dawn builds to Charged Poise closure in final photograph's shadow and ship lift, reconfiguring era's end with conceptual cost of lost wonder legible in "a lie of permanence." Orientation anchored early in crater summit. Single scene tightens meaningfully without micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moonlit summit as micro-setting constrains via time pressure and dust choreography, charging final image where shadow stretches "toward home." Sensory hierarchy (hush humming, boot crunches, breath fog) reflects inspector's priorities. Earth as recurring jewel guides farewell choice, mirroring internal loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to hoard crater's beauty tightens accumulatively via canister pulses and drone hum, narrowing to renunciation in boarding ship with felt cost of "what it had lost." Agency in timed glows and photos drives escalation. No live antagonist but situational pressure from dawn coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of time's erasure emerges from sand grain, hourglass motif shifting to photos outlasting, reweighting premise in final viewport image without moralizing. Sand's reprise answers "nights did end" with resonant ambiguity on wonder's death. Particulars like bioluminescent question mark avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable with perceptual signature in lunar-biased noticing (dust ghosts, sun's knife-edge). Lyrical rhythm modulates from hush to engine ignition, diction controlled in "universe clearing its throat." No dialogue; voice specificity intact under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "each click was a theft, a defiance, a way to hoard beauty." Rhythmic variety in short punchy photos vs. flowing reflections; no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("ghosts of light," "pale jewel") but pattern-taught and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lunar mining loss via stolen sand grain and timed canister transforms space-age trope into personal defiance. Risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes via hush's hush. Sand-to-photo arc feels inevitable, non-obvious.</comment>
