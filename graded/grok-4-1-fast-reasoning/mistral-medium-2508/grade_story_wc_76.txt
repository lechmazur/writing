<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in clockmaker obsession drives high-stakes choice to step beyond, with embodied exhilaration ("laugh clawed... raw and bleak and exhilarated"); interiority particular but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, missing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from yoyo setup to violet light surge and path reveal; CR closure in "world tilted through" and erased reflection reconfigures fate with conceptual cost (tide swallows path, clocks backward); orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hunger stones constrain choice (carvings deepen into path at low tide) and charge final image (reflection erased); selective sensory details (brass innards rusted, string burns faintly) filtered through clockmaker bias integrate into action; 9+ gate met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unmake future signaled early, tightens via mechanism "sang" and radiance wrapping ankles, forcing step with agency; cost legible in foreclosed shore-bound life and world reconfiguration under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unmaking fate emerges organically from reverse-spin particulars, resonant CR in final reflection of "might have been" erased reweights premise without moral; no thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (gears, spirals, counter-motion); rhythmic control modulates to peak compression ("world tilted—not sideways, but through"); purposeful lyric elision taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure, but figurative density peaks heavily in climax ("light bled... bruised violet of a storm’s underbelly, cold fire") borders coherence strain without muddle; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of yoyo puzzle and counter-clockwise unmaking transforms time trope organically; risk-taking in textural CR heightens stakes, feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
