<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quietly analytic trait drives concrete micro-choices like noting counterclockwise snow and upward shift, earning final renunciation of knowing with embodied cost in tucking notebook beside sister photo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as globe anomalies densify realizations toward CR closure where Liora lets go of needing to know, with legible cost in "sediment" lie and unbroken horizon.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken library and globe micro-setting constrain dive pressure and charge final image, with biolum fish and warped desk selectively mirroring internal thresholds via analytic POV filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding letting go tightens accumulatively through anomaly deepenings that force trade-off renunciation, with agency in noting shifts and lying report viscerally felt as heavier-than-truth sediment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of thresholds' shadow-cost emerges organically from globe/lighthouse shifts and sister parallel, with final sea-quiet image resonantly reweighting pursuit without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature ("noted the way") biases noticing toward physics anomalies, with rhythmic diction modulating from analytic precision to charged poise at "she let go."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors (snow "falling sideways") without loops or drift; ear-test rhythm breathes with reflective escalation to crisp closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh Earhart-quantum-fold synthesis via anomalous globe transforms lost-expedition trope, with risk-taking lyric accumulation heightening letting-go stakes through inevitable physics-melancholy hinge.</comment>
