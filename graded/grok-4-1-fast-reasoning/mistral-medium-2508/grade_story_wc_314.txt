<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in sentimental rigor masking ("the last shred of the girl who had once pressed flowers"), with embodied tremble propelling the ritual choice; final step-through earned by harmonizing impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from crystal/flame to blue pulse and valley door; CR closure legible in "The door sealed shut behind her" with old-world cost as orchard/waterfall dims.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting charges closure: orchard's petals/roots twist causally from flame, yielding to glass trees/ember fruits that sharpen new focus and constrain forward turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonize via ritual) tightens through flame-cadence shift narrowing to transformation; cost felt in lost "girl" and fading old world, agency in tilting crystal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("She smiled... toward the sound") non-literally answers logic/intuition divide, reweighting via blue fire/chord without moral; emerges organically from ritual particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (fire's "hunger," birds' "equations") biases alchemical noticing; rhythmic control peaks in transformation without distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "fire drank the frozen dew, hissing as it swallowed something older"); figurative coherence taught early as voice, no loops/artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical ritual as logic/intuition birds/crystal/flame; risk in lyric CR ("harmony so perfect it hurt") heightens stakes organically.</comment>
