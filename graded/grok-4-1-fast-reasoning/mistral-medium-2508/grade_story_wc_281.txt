<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Affectionate skeptic shines in contradictory impulses—kissing cat yet pressing sliver despite past trauma—earning the closure choice to follow Mira with visible cost in sliver's dissolution. Interiority embodied via twitching fingers and aching teeth; Mira backstory anchors present via light-painting cue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from static hum to walls breathing to painted door as Charged Poise/CR, with cost legible in "sliver had dissolved into her skin" and vastness risk. Single scene oriented early (studio, post-shock by para 1); no penalty, pattern pays off seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Studio as micro-setting constrains via fiber-optic brushes and rigs, charging final door image on walls; sensory hierarchy (ozone, burnt sugar, pulsing light) filters through Lena's painterly bias. Vivid details evolve causally with events, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminate Mira's paths) signaled early, escalates via agency in somatic sequence and painting, narrowing to follow-or-paint trade-off under Accumulative lens. One tightening (Mira's texture voice) forces stance crystallization; cost unmistakable in skin dissolution and "drown in" vastness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of belief-in-what-matters emerges organically from skeptic-to-painter arc, resonant in final "light remembered" image reweighting pathways as seen/fractal without moralizing. Subtext layers via geode reflections and willowglass stroke; ambiguity lingers in door's pulse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in light/color textures ("veins of it, pulsing"); voice modulates rhythm from skeptical twitch to thrum, purposeful compression taught early. No head-hopping; diction biased to painterly idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "walls breathed" advances setting/action/atmosphere); figurative pattern (light veins, fractal edges) taught early without muddle in peak. Minor density in metaphors ("texture, a brushstroke") doesn't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-painting as telepathic map transforms recall trope via geode key; risk in surreal escalation (somatic gestures, breathing walls) heightens stakes organically. Final path "unwound—fractal, precise" feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
