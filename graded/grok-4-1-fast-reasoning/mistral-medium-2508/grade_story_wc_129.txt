<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reed's hands-first memory and bold solo search despite pairs reveal contradictory impulses; final palm-press endurance earns grafting with embodied ache-cost, concretely particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as tags evolve "I was here" to "We are here," tightening density to CR closure; final "ache of recognition" makes conceptual cost legible in obsidian hum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crater's "murmur of lost languages" and obsidian's "trapped starlight" constrain search paths and charge final palm-press; orchard crystals hum to mirror internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake of communal grafting tightens via shared search drawing village into arbor handprints; agency in organizing/reaching Syl forecloses isolation with felt relational cost at dawn constellation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tags accumulatively reweight kinship from individual mark to woven web; final "languages...sounded like an invitation" offers non-literal resonance without moral, embracing slow-weaving complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sculptor's perceptual signature—"hands remembered...before her mind"—sustains lyrical rhythm; sparse dialogue like "You didn’t have to look" carries subtext, stable single-POV under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density in "syllables dissolving before they could form meaning" propels without loops; rhythmic variety peaks clean at "ache of recognition," zero artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Violet tags as kinship breadcrumbs synthesize elusive artist with communal arbor ingeniously; risk of lyric fantasy premise transforms tropes, inevitable in hindsight at handprint constellation.</comment>
