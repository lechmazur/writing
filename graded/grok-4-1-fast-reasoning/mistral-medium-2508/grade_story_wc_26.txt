<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's dusk-noticing trait roots motivation in concrete perception, driving footage comparison to exchange; contradictory half-emptiness impulses act in the palm-offering, earning shadow-loss cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from stone discovery to footage unveiling to RR closure in shadow-merge; cost legible in "her shadow thin but present" reconfiguring options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blooming library constrains choices via protective curator lie and shifting shelves; stone-as-micro-setting charges final glowing image, mirroring internal states through tactile handling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of engaging unbound hope tightens via Liora's half-empty vulnerability recognition; agency in shadow-offer forecloses wholeness under Accumulative lens with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hope's vessel emerges implicitly via poet's line and shadow trade; final settled shadow offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting prior longing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with dusk-biased perceptual signature ("day surrendered to night"); rhythmic modulation peaks in hushed "library sighed," no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (stone "pressed to her chest, feeling its pulse"); minor reflective overwriting avoids loops, propelling to clear closure rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Post-dream shadows unbound transforms detachment trope via library eternity; shadow-exchange synthesis feels inevitable, risking quiet closure payoff without gimmick.</comment>
