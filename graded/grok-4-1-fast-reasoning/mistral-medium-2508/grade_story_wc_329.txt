<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via micro-choices like pressing shell to chest, revealing internal alignment with orchard's rebirth; earned change in her "own chest" breaking free. Minor lack of shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density building to RR closure (orchard exhales, statues melt into soil) with felt cost in fraying sky-bridge and her waiting. Orientation anchored immediately in sky-bridge/orchard; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via patrolling statues sensing vibrations and brass roots strangling life, charging final blooming image; sensory hierarchy (wept sap vs. oil, groaning branches) reflects POV urgency. Recurrent oldest tree anchors evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken beauty vs. mechanical chokehold) tightens via shell-signaled density increase, forcing statues' falter; agency in playing louder forecloses routine with cost in their "wound" memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming wild pulse emerges organically from particulars like locust escape to locusts' flight; final crimson petal and new song reweight mechanical premise non-literally with rebirth cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (vibrations, pulses, melodies); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, peaking in "gap between knowing and understanding" without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "locust shell...pulsed faintly in time with her heartbeat"); purposeful lyric repetition like "resonantly soft" taught early avoids loops, though minor figurative density in climax slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of violin-heart signaling and statue-melting rebirth transforms tarnished wonder trope; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes, inevitable in locust flight finale.</comment>
