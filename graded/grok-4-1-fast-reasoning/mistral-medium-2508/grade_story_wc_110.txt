<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lena's motivation rooted in past box office mistrust drives micro-choices like pressing the lens and drawing the ticket; embodied emotions via warped skin lines show contradiction thawing. Couple's minimal presence applies pressure without depth, but her earned change forecloses isolation with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from quiet lobby to ticket slide and final drawings, landing Charged Poise closure where lens/tickets reconfigure mistrust with conceptual cost of past habits seen plainly in "doodles weren’t cryptic anymore."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt's acoustics enable eavesdropping and light-trickling constrains perception, charging final image; lens as micro-setting tool warps skin early, reprises in pocket with reweighted meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thaw mistrust) signaled early, tightens via doodle intervention narrowing verbal failure into visual transparency; agency in sliding ticket forecloses inaction with felt relational cost legible in couple's "Us."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of non-verbal honesty emerges organically from lens-warped truths and evolving doodles; final image of luminous tickets answers central question of mistrust's thaw without moralizing, reweighting prior concert ticket motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (noticing hand-truths, light bends); rhythmic prose modulates from expectant hush to resonant clarity, dialogue sparse but subtextual in couple's clipped exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm and varied syntax propel accumulative texture; minor figurative density in ending fragments ("shape of truth") borders overwriting but stays legible without loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of salvaged lens as truth-warper transforms eavesdropping trope into doodle-mediated thaw; risk in lyric hush heightens emotional specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
