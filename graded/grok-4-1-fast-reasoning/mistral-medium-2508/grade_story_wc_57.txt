<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's infinite patience and philosophical bent shine in concrete actions like decoding knots patiently in the cold, with embodied emotion in trembling hands from revelation, not chill. Interiority particular, revealing worldview through object-stories; final splicing earns change with commitment cost. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits exceptional tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via knot decodings to fulgurite voices, culminating in Conceptual Repricing as Elias splices seed pod, reweighting rope as living archive. Orientation anchored early (dock, harbor, winter). Closure cost legible in impossible bell buoy toll and his stepping into fog as "past his only destination."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details selective and purposeful: frost on rope, breath-ghost, fog swallowing dock constrain his quick work and charge final image. Dock's groan under snow mirrors settling earth post-knot; recurring rope/fiber integrates setting into action. POV bias filters through collector's eye, noticing patterns others ignore.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode/preserve histories escalates accumulatively: hitches to fulgurite sounds narrow to preservation realization, forcing splicing agency. One tightening via voices trapped in glass changes knowledge/options; cost felt in tending commitment as fog dissolves normal paths. Enters high band via trade-off legibility at "archives meant to be tended."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of threading past into present emerges organically via knots/seeds/glass, with final "knots began to sing" offering resonant non-literal answer to preservation question. Subtext in secret weavers' breadcrumb reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Complexity lingers in Elias joining their ambiguous garden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in pattern-seeing (e.g., "braided ledger of tides"); rhythm modulates from patient decoding to quick splicing urgency. Prose texture distinct—poetic diction like "fibers grown around it like roots"—fits collector's mind without leakage. No dialogue; elisions purposeful for mystery payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "loop within a loop, a cipher" advances plot/atmosphere/theme); rhythm varies for ear, syntax propels revelation. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("whisper not of wind, but of voices, layered like rings") during fulgurite beat slightly muddles but doesn't touch closure. No loops; closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knots trapping storm-sounds/time via fulgurite transforms relic-hunting trope into singing archive. Risky lyric fantasy realism inevitable in hindsight from seed/ropes parallels; bold CR heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
