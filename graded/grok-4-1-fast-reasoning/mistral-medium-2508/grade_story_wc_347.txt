<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reluctant caretaker Liora shows contradictory impulses—refusing pleas lifelong yet aiding the girl with a nut—earning her final commitment to impressions and fixing the blueprint. Interiority embodied in warm nut and tracing lines; flaws like isolation compound without hedging. Final micro-choice hierarchy reveals values with ongoing orchard cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: backstory shards build density to Charged Poise closure where Liora presses the last nut and traces blueprint, reconfiguring labyrinth from trap to guide with felt isolation cost. Orientation anchored early in orchard/labyrinth; one tightening via girl's plea narrows to her resolve. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in "she didn’t look back."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cliffside orchard, violet fruit, brass birds constrain choices—routes learned, frost stiffens joints—charging final frost image over hut/blueprint. Sensory selective: whirring wings, glistening fruit reflect POV priorities. Micro-setting (nut in dirt) guides action without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to guide vs. curse burden signaled early, tightens accumulatively via girl to Liora's nut/resolve, narrowing isolation path. Agency in precise impressions forecloses refusal with orchard endurance cost. Pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of guidance amid curse emerges via particulars: jammed gears, nut impressions shift to "labyrinth would remember," reweighting premise without moral. Final blueprint trace offers non-literal answer to trap-or-guide question. Resonance from flawed endurance, no tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in precise images like "indents in the earth, offhandedly exact." Rhythmic control modulates to frost poise; brief "Please" natural/subtextual. No head-hopping; compression taught early, paid in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm—no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figs in peak (nut press/blueprint trace). Selective telling anchors reflection; read-aloud ear flows with scene breath. Zero artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory fruit, nut guides, jammed guide-labyrinth transforms tropes via "offhandedly exact" impressions and bird routes. Risky accumulative lyricism heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight in frost-locked birds vs. free traveler.</comment>
