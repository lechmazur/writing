<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between observational calm and interventionist action act vividly in the scene, earning the final choice to "step onto the ice with her"; shadow-laced trait reveals through dulled conflicts and fragment recognition without labels. Interiority concrete via pulsing fragment and curling breath. Final renunciation of passivity shows with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as visions and mirror ripples build density to Charged Poise closure: Elias touches fragment and shadow, smiles, steps forward amid groaning ice and shattering mirrors, reconfiguring observer to actor with legible cost of foolishness on thinning ice. Orientation anchors by para 2. One tightening via descent and mirror adjustment suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lighthouse orchard and ice floes constrain via swaying branches, groaning floes, and cliff-edge positioning that force descent to wait; mirrors as micro-setting enable glimpses and charge shattering finale. Sensory selection (wax/wool smell, clicking bones) filters through intuitive POV bias. Environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save anomaly girl from ice) signaled early via visions; textural escalation accumulates via pulsing fragment, whispering mirrors, restless ice to agency crystallization in stepping forward, foreclosing safe observation with on-page cost of personal risk. No reversals needed; pressure coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of empathy-to-action emerges implicitly via fragment's "map empathy onto action" shift, answered non-literally in mirrors shattering as "glimpses finally whole," reweighting isolation of courage. Subtext in shadow hesitation and ice hunger invites ambiguity without morals. Resonance from particulars like outstretched hands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of intuitive omens (light hesitating, trees swaying without wind); rhythmic prose modulates from slow spins to sharp stars and eager groans under rising pressure. Diction controlled, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping or leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs (short sentences at "The ice groaned again, closer now, eager"); high density packs sensory/action in lines like "He adjusted the mirrors one last time, angling them toward the cliff’s edge." Minor figurative density in opening risks slight overwrite but patterns purposefully without muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow-laced peacekeeper glimpsing via warped mirrors to intervene on haunted ice transforms tropes organically; risk of lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via fragment-mirror-ice motif constraining choice. No derivatives; bold premise commits fully.</comment>
