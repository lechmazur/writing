<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via scars as compass, with internal conflict in past mistakes vs. present heeding; final readiness earned through micro-choices like pressing clipping to wrist. Minor slip: poetic interiority occasionally abstracts emotion ("dreams that clawed at her ribs") without full contradiction in peak bridge run.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from glade whispers to chasm bridge to unfolding tapestry, with Charged Poise closure in silver leaf sprout reweighting covenant as waiting. Orientation anchored early ("cobalt glade," Liora kneeling); cost legible in sealed chasm and transmuted pain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (damp earth, crushed violets, sap-weeping scars) constrains choices, as maze paths respond to scars and glade "screams" at dais. Final image charged by cobalt hues deepening and glade exhaling, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uneclipse covenant via intersection) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through scar-guided maze tightening and bridge run forcing endurance; agency in heeding surges pressure. Cost visible in rooted shadows freed, though climax relies more on visionary density than sharp trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of heeding echoes/scars emerges organically from particulars (scars blooming, tapestry of moments); final "covenant was never broken... waiting" reweights premise without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on readiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with visionary perceptual signature ("scars burned... pulling her"); sparse dialogue distinct ("You’re early") carries subtext. Rhythmic control modulates intensity, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but figurative overload in climax ("bridge of woven roots... nautilus shell," "wind that carried... old promises") muddles coherence slightly in maze/bridge beats, docking from 9-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic maze/vision quest via scars-as-loom and future-self intersection; transforms tropes organically, with bold poetic risk heightening closure image without gimmickry.</comment>
