<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, like breath hitching at the vibrating arrow and diving into the fracture; interiority concrete via pilot-specific perceptions. Limited shown internal contradiction reduces from 9-band; forward drive dominates without simultaneous impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via sensory buildup (tremors to hum) holds to CR closure: seed's song reconfigures resilience with conceptual cost in moss-spread and arrow's crumble. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene causality tightens via inversion-ending pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating arches and upward river constrain glider navigation and landing, charging final harmony image; bioluminescent moss pulses with urgency, filtering through pilot bias. Sensory hierarchy vivid under crisis, narrowing to hum and sap.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mentor’s mystery to resilience source) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via moss cluster to mouth-dive and seed-grab amid inversion clock; agency in reach forecloses flight path with time cost. One tightening sufficient, reweighting knowledge at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grown resilience emerges organically from seed-pulse to sapling-song realization, reweighting inversions as beginnings without statement; final chorus image answers non-literally, lingering via transformed Veyra.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with pilot perceptual signature (currents, moss acceleration); voice texture modulates rhythmically from hum to shout-ready poise, purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fracture wasn’t a crack—it was a mouth" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies, no loops, but minor figurative density in peak (whirling silence) nudges below 9. Clean propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inverting orchard planet and echo-instructions transforms survival tropes via moss/seed logic; risk in lyric silence-to-chorus arc heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
