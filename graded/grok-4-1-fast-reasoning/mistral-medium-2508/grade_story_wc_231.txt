<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to decode the boutonnière roots in his gap-observing trait, culminating in an earned choice to pass the memory with isolation's cost felt in the final pinning. Interiority particular via trembling hands and preserved jars; embodied emotion in saltwater steeping. Minor slip: internal conflict more reflective than simultaneous impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds to CR closure in "let the light do the rest," reweighting memories as tidal passage with vessel-cost legible in crumbling boutonnière. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no shards, single scene coherent. Cost proof: final exhale curls into cold air, memory freed yet persistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Opal dock, slick planks, lavender nets constrain investigation and mirror isolation; nautical twilight narrows to beam's arc charging final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: gaps over details. Recurring boutonnière as micro-setting handled tactilely, evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode/return memory—deepens accumulatively via steeping revelation, narrowing to endurance as vessel; agency in climbing/adjusting forecloses keeping with felt cost. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres to Charged Poise. Minor abstractness in stakes before fragments surface.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of passed memories emerges from particulars (gouged piling, 1902 log, unfurling petals), resonating in final image reweighting isolation without moral. Subtext in silences, implications; ambiguity lingers in "borrowed goodbyes." Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct: gap-noticing signature ("tide hesitated," "pupils dilated"); rhythm modulates from mist-dream compression to beam-arc poise. Stable close third-person POV; flashback whisper natural/subtextual. Experimental texture taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multilayer (e.g., "planks slick with the breath of the sea" advances setting/atmosphere/action). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative coherent (driftwood voice, vein of bone). Propulsion peaks in steeping-to-climb cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: borrowed memories via lighthouse vessels transforms isolation trope, inevitable in hindsight from Edelweiss log to tidal release. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes; no derivative echoes.</comment>
