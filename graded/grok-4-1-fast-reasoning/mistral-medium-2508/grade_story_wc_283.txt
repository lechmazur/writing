<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation roots in prophecy fragments and embodied ache (ribs), driving micro-choices like threading the needle; contradictory belief vs. suspicion peaks in the well's retrieval, earning the final renunciation with personal cost. Interiority particular via calloused hands and ledger code. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via motif density (amber, buttons, echoes) holds to CR closure: pattern snaps on button's face reveal, reweighting prophecy as choice with "we break" cost in backward sand image. Orientation anchors by para 2; one tightening via echo-to-well suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber-veined walls and slick well constrain path/retrieval, charging final button-on-rim image; sensory hierarchy (glowing resin, iron water) POV-filtered via Elias's trade. Micro-setting (jar, needle) evolves tactilely without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hourglass/cliffs vs. unraveling truth) signaled in ledger, deepens accumulatively via confession echo and trapped face narrowing to renunciation; agency in threading/pulling forecloses completion path with legible personal cost. No reversals needed; pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rewoven fate emerges via button pattern without statement; final "threads to pull" reconfigures prophecy non-literally, resonant with ambiguity (cliffs steady "for now"). No moralizing; irony in traveler's face charges CR.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited third with perceptual signature (time as threads/burden, amber glows); rhythmic control modulates from quiet warehouse to howling wind, compression under stress legible. No dialogue or slips; prose as character via turner's deliberate syntax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "echo slithered free" multisensory advance); zero loops, varied rhythm, purposeful figures (trapped sunlight) cohere without muddle in peak well beat. Clean mechanics, specificity over generics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy trope via buttons as pivots and amber echoes; fresh synthesis of hourglass/time-weaving feels inevitable in ledger snap and backward sand. Bold risk in CR closure heightens without gimmick.</comment>
