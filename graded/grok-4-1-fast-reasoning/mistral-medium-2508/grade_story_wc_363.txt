<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Spinner's motivation rooted in grief drives ritualistic choices with embodied precision ("fingers moving with the desperate precision"); earned endurance via sacrifice, but minimal on-page contradictory impulses limit to very strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density to Charged Poise closure ("He sat down... and began to weave his own thread"); cost legible in "the sender must stay" and bones-into-roots image; mosaic shards coherent with legible transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard/bamboo/apple tree constrain choices (bead found "half-buried in the loam", tapestry hung "from the apple tree’s lowest branch") and charge final image; sensory details selective and POV-biased, vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging distance) signaled early, escalates texturally through ritual beats to sacrificial tightening; agency in weaving forecloses path with felt cost, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial connection emerges organically from weaving/silence particulars; final image ("a loom began to hum") offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature ("raveling silence that coiled like smoke"); stable mosaic focalization despite late shift, rhythmic control modulates intensity purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel (e.g., short punchy sentences in dissolution beat); figurative language coherent and pattern-taught, but slight overwriting density in mid-weaving without added pressure dings peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic weaving across silence/distance feels inevitable; bold mosaic risk heightens resonance without gimmickry, transforming tropes via specific ritual logic.</comment>
