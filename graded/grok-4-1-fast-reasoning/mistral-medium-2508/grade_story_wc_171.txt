<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Kael's blade twitch versus signing and Veyra's steady hands masking pulse tremor; final notch-carving earns change through prior memory anchor. Relationship crucible forces Kael's human unraveling. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like hollow promises complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual density builds to Charged Poise in signature drying and "Probably," reconfiguring peace with felt cost of inevitable breakage. Orientation anchored early (terrace, Veyra/Kael). Single scene coherent; persistent clipboard constraint shapes tactics/final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring terrace (cracked mosaic, vines, lavender/gunpowder) and clipboard constrain ritual choices and charge final notch/grip image. Sensory hierarchy POV-filtered (Veyra notes notches' grief). No white-room; evolving shadows/sun mirror internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace vs endless war) signaled early, tightens via past-notch memory deepening Kael's hitch to signature agency. Cost legible in shaking hand and "another grave." Accumulative pressure coheres to foreclosed violence path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Redemption's price emerges organically via notches/installments, culminating in non-literal final image of "gold—the color of surrender, the color of beginning again." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "Probably" without tidy resolution. Reweights prior hollow treaties through flawed hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature (ritual objects as "polished grief"); dialogue subtextual ("stronger ink") pursues goals distinctly. Rhythmic prose modulates tension (short exhales vs longer cosmic indifference). No head-hopping; elision of war backstory interleaves cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "ink made from the ashes... olive branch" advances ritual/atmosphere). Varied rhythm propels without loops; figurative consistency voice-motivated, coherent in peak signing beat. Zero scaffold; final "stars kept dancing" recharges opener.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clipboard notches transform treaty trope into tactile redemption ledger; risky lyric accumulative risks poetic overwriting but pays off in charged closure. Non-obvious synthesis of ritual/grief feels inevitable. Bold voice/ritual frame heightens flawed-peace stakes.</comment>
