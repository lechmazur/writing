<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's "heuristically gentle" trait anchors specific micro-choices like flagstone replanting and crumb-planting, driving higher-stakes baking/distribution with earned endurance; contradictory noticing/refusal reveals hierarchy of values without safety-hedging. Final hand-leading into wheat forecloses adjustment path with relational cost. Voice-specific perception persists under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density from warm bread to midnight shoot to city-wide wheat/loaves reconfigures "adjustment" premise (CR) with conceptual cost of prior wounds uncloaking. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (Liora, tea house, frost). One tightening at wheat riot narrows options toward refusal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Overgrown courtyard/wheat constrains planting/baking choices and charges final image where fountain stood; sensory hierarchy (steam/scent/earth) reflects Liora's biased noticing. Details evolve causally (cold oven roars). Palace vines curling toward moon subtly tensions tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (refuse creeping normality) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via shoot→wheat→guards kneeling, forcing stance crystallization; agency in guerrilla crumb-planting forecloses passive adjustment. Visible cost: guards abandon posts, prince mud-caked. Coheres under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of sacred-in-ordinary emerges organically via bread→wheat→loaves callbacks, reweighting "adjustment as absolution"; final "coins felt like enough" offers non-literal CR without moralizing. Particulars like locket/locket recognition resist binaries, inviting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable with perceptual signature ("ordinary tilted askew"); rhythmic syntax modulates from observation to charged poise at "took his hand into wheat." Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual; diction biased to Liora's noticing avoids omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density: lines like "steam rising in gray dawn as she broke it open" propel via multi-job imagery/rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent (flour like snow); openings vary, read-aloud ear perfect. No artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: guerrilla bread-gardening transforms vanishing-bakery trope into uncloaking ritual, risking lyric accumulative structure that heightens conceptual stakes; bakery sign reappearance inevitable from Liora's noticing pattern (+0.3 risk). No template echoes.</comment>
