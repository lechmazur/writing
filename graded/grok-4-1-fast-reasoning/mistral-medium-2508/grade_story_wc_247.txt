<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Characters vividly distinct through actions—Elias's signing persists amid danger, revealing endurance; Liora's lunge toward the threat embodies her charisma as blade-in-velvet. Contradictory impulses shine in Elias signing *no*, *yes*, *now*. Minor flaw: interiority poetic but occasionally abstracts emotion without deeper embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from silence-mapping to luminous waves crashing with color, culminating in Charged Poise RR where harbor hums alive post-unraveling. Closure cost legible in Liora's shaking hands and heavier camera. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Harbor micro-setting constrains climax—waves rise answering signs, moonlight fractures into notes charging final image of alive silence. Sensory hierarchy (salt, creak, color) selective via Elias/Liora priorities. No white-room; evolves causally with tide shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (steal back forgotten songs) signaled early, escalates via textural density to pattern break (faceless hunger) forcing stance crystallization in lunge/signing. Agency-driven tightening: camera flash reveals foe, waves resolve under lens. Cost unmistakable in unraveling wail and post-shake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of remembering forgotten emerges via particulars—silence-to-music, empty camera drinking light—reweighting premise in final harbor hum without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer: "the forgotten began to sing," charging image with joyful sorrow. No tidy binary; ambiguity in secret-keeping lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature biased to silence/light (e.g., "signs for sounds that had no voice"). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short sentences in climax. Dialogue sparse, subtextual, goal-driven ("You don’t get to keep them"). No head-hopping; elision purposeful for mystery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "framing him... to disrupt" advances plot/character). Rhythm varies, read-aloud flows; metaphors coherent (ink in water). Minor deduction for dense figuratives bordering overwrite in climax ("sapphire, emerald, gold"), but pattern-taught and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sign language maps silence to conjure waves against faceless hunger, transforming tropes via camera-as-shield and color-crash resolution. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes; inevitable in hindsight from opening signs. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
