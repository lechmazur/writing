<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira's curiosity drives consistent micro-choices like testing the chain and drawing the map, earning her shift to teacher; Kael's skepticism applies pressure and resolves via tactile lesson. Interiority concrete via hands tracing maps and chain's feel. Voice distinct in dialogue; final endurance of elders' resistance shows cost without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images of chain, light refraction, map build density to CR closure where final Spire image reconfigures horizons as openings with conceptual cost of prior blindness. Orientation anchored early in Veythar/Spire; time shards legible via "next morning" and "by the time." One tightening via Kael's acceptance narrows to collective shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Chain link as micro-setting constrains choices (pivot, refract) and charges final image as "bridge, lever, promise." Sensory details (bioluminescent glow on rust, currents honing Spire) filtered through Elira's navigational bias integrate into action. Atmosphere of somber marvel coheres without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn star navigation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via lesson flicker/path revelation forcing Kael's wavering to plotting courses. Agency in Elira's refracting chain and map-drawing forecloses blind navigation. Felt cost in shallow breath/fear of dark, charging poise at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of unfolding from dark emerges via chain/map/starlight images shifting from end to beginning, resonant in final "rise" without statement. Subtext in Kael's "not meant to go" invites ambiguity on destiny. No moralizing; irony in surface relic enabling abyssal sky.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person Elira POV with perceptual signature (geometric noticing: grooves, edges, pivots). Voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm from deliberate to flickering path. Dialogue subtextual (stubborn pupil yields via "feel how it wants"); natural distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety (short flickers amid flowing sentences) propels; high density layers sensory/ideational jobs per line. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—unfolding motif consistent/physical. Final line recharges chain without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh benthic aliens unfolding from trenches teach star geometry via surface chain, transforming tropes organically. Risky lyric accumulation heightens conceptual stakes; irreplaceable synthesis in horizon-spiral reweighting feels inevitable.</comment>
