<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (listening vs. interjecting into void) act simultaneously when flake warns "Interject now, or it collapses," earning the hand-plunge choice with flake's dissolution as felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as whisper density builds to chorus and mandala shift; CR closure lands on-page in "mist swallowed the first line hungrily," reweighting unlearning with conceptual cost of embracing void.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist, tiles, and sands constrain choices (ear to flake, hand into mandala) and charge final image where mist "curls in like a question" and "swallow[s] the first line hungrily."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning in mess vs. unlearning) signaled early tightens via one accumulative deepening when mandala splits, forcing interjection with visible cost (flake dissolves, patterns shift).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "mess is the map" emerges organically from particulars like flake's phrase and chorus of doubts; final image of drawing the void offers resonant, non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature in artist-biased noticing ("lines blurrier than he intended, as if the air itself resisted"); rhythmic control heightens under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; no loops or artifacts dull closure, as "mist curled in like a question" lands crisp and image-charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of whispering stone, emergent hush, and unlearning ritual transformed through artist's tactile patterns; risk-taking in void-drawing heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
