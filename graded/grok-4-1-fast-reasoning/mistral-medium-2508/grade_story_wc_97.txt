<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of patient waiting versus bold action culminate in earned reunion; "strategically creative" trait shown concretely in splicing film, compelling the final piano encore with visible cost of years lost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as motifs (clock, compasses, film) tighten to reveal path; closure as Charged Poise in reunion and clock chiming reconfigures time's stasis with felt cost of lateness pinpointed in "You're late."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal arbor constrains via bark-door and mist-staircase, charging final image of arbor holding them suspended; sensory details like "wind hummed through the leaves" and "ozone and old paper" integrate purposefully through Lena's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reunion tightens accumulatively as compasses lock and clock warms, narrowing to door; agency in threading projector forces trade-off of burning bulb, with cost legible in endured wait crystallized at reunion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of defying temporal endings emerges organically from clock/film motifs shifting to "encore neither dared imagine"; final image of music carried forward reweights longing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in music/time metaphors like "notes stretching behind her like a wake"; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual, modulating rhythm under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds; rhythmic variety peaks in "film stuttered to life, images bleeding," propelling to closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of film-spliced magic in arbor transforms waiting-lover trope; risk in magical progression feels inevitable from compass study to refuge reunion.</comment>
