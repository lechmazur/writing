<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora's drive for beauty in unfinished compels engaging the girl over solitude, earning shared endurance; embodied in calloused fingers and ghost-notes. Girl's pressure reveals values hierarchy via new melody choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: hush-music density builds from solo play to collaborative shapes, tightening via girl's "doesn't stop in my head"; Charged Poise closure in "first note of tomorrow" with dawn-choice cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse/shipwrecks constrain rustle-hid approach and acoustic hush, mirroring internal silence; final "greenhouse sighed... shipwrecks settled" charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hush-vs-beauty stake signaled early, deepens accumulatively via girl's arrival and stick-drawings forcing melodic response; cost in low fire, sleeping girl, felt dawn trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Unfinished melody shifts via collaboration to answer beauty-in-hush without moral; "quiet certainty that beauty didn’t need endings" emerges from particulars, reweighting prior solitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with acoustic perceptual bias ("note so pure it seemed to suspend the damp air"); dialogue natural/subtextual, girl's whisper distinct from Liora's ping-tap.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion varies with hush-breaks, high density integrates senses without loops; figurative coherence in "ribs of forgotten beasts" supports without muddling peak collaboration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh post-fire orchard-cathedral with stick-violin duet transforms ruin trope; irreplaceable hush-unbinding synthesis inevitable from setup.</comment>
