<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied aches and micro-choices like whispering to the resistant gear, revealing contradictory impulses (knowing the prophecy yet misreading dawn) that earn the final reach-in; motivation rooted in sister's loss intensifies to compel the hand into the mirror with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density builds from gear-sighing to mirror-hum and child-reflection, landing Charged Poise closure in "the watch warm against her ribs" and door-swing with legible conceptual cost of mended absence; orientation anchors crisply by second paragraph, pattern holds seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen library's ice-encased shelves and frostbitten water-mirror constrain choices (tools scattered on ice, palm-ripples) and charge final image (mirrors weep silver); sensory selection (breath as old ink, oil of burnt sugar) reflects locksmith's mechanical priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend clock for sister) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via gear-resistance ("gummed with...memories") and child accusing "you're late," narrowing to reach-in agency with visible cost (hall shudders); one tightening suffices, pressure coheres to reweight options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mending time's absence emerges organically from gears, prophecy, and watch's "shape of time’s absence," offering resonant non-literal answer in final image without moralizing; subtext in child-dissolving ripples reweights prior loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (mechanisms as prophecy-cracks, breath as ink) with rhythmic control modulating from hush to shudder-click; stable third-limited POV biases toward tactile repair, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("ripples spread like cracks in a prophecy") and varied rhythm; figurative language pattern-taught early pays off without muddle in peak gear-slotting, zero loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-broken-clock and water-mirror child transforms time-repair tropes; risk in elliptical CR ("she felt like the key") heightens stakes organically from prior particulars.</comment>
