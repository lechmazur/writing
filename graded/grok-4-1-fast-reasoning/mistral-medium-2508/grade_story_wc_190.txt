<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's micro-choices like dipping the spoon and adjusting the dial reveal a hierarchy of values under the passenger's unspoken pressure, earning her recalibration as Earned Stasis. Passenger's embodiment through damp gloves and flinching shoulders shows contradiction without therapy-speak. Interiority particular via "language of stillness"; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from vial's crystals to passenger's exhale catalyzing prism tremble, culminating in Charged Poise RR where terrace hums holding sorrow—cost legible in "not lighter, but better distributed." Orientation anchored early (Elias on drifting terrace post-train). One tightening via child's laughter complication suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prism terrace and vial constrain choices (bending sound, absorbing noise) and charge final image of humming hush. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: Elias notes absence via dial, water lappets mirror internal rhythms. Details tactile, integrated (spoon dip), no white-room; micro-setting as "setting" excels.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching silence to carry sorrow) signaled early; textural escalation via deepening density—exhale triggers vial darkening recognition, laughter forces dial-turn softening, narrowing to recalibrated weight. Agency in Elias's murmurs/actions forecloses accusation path with felt distribution cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (silence carries unmoored sorrow) emerges organically from vial/prism events, vial's glow as resonant non-literal answer reweighting transit without moralizing. Subtext in gesture/silence; passenger's palm-press ties particulars to ambiguity-lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-close Elias with perceptual signature: biased to hush's pulse, rhythmic syntax ("vaulting hush so deep it hummed in the bones"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, advances ("gives it somewhere to go"); no head-hopping, voice modulates intensity purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm/syntax mirroring quiet pulse; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—figurative language (prisms fracturing dusk) pattern-taught early, coherent under pressure. Read-aloud ear-perfect; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: silence-as-catalyst operator on prism terrace transforms transit trope via vial's evolving logic, inevitable hindsight in hush's carrying work. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative echoes.</comment>
