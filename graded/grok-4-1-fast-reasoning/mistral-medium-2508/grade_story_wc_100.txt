<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's weariness embodied in cracked hands and salt-sorrow drives stubborn choice to climb despite knowing he "should have tossed it," earning final endurance with cost of adding his own name. Minor epiphanic phrasing in "rest wasn’t the absence" slightly abstracts, but impulses contradict in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from blurring ledger to lens flare's stillness, delivering Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as dead rise/sink completed and lens crumbles—cost legible in "crumbled in his hands, its warmth gone."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Library-morgue and lighthouse ribcage constrain climb/swim and charge final cleared-water image; anemones' flicker/steady mirrors stakes. Sensory hierarchy (bioluminescent pulse, bone-vibration) selective and POV-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dead's rest) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via restless ink to forehead-press agency foreclosing ignorance; cost felt in currents' insistence and lens destruction, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of rest as "you are here" emerges organically via lens warmth/voices to final sinking with completion; resonant non-literal answer in ledger closing, reweighting prior blurring without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (sea's guilt, older warmth); rhythmic modulation peaks at "exhaled. The lens flared"—diction controlled, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short punchy sentences at flare); figurative coherence in breath/holding motifs purposeful, no loops—minor density in swim paragraph nudges below 9.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underwater library-ledger and signal-rest transforms tropes; risk in lens's bone-call inevitability heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
