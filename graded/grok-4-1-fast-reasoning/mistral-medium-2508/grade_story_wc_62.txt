<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Carver's shift from etching names to hollowing space earned via chisel slip and spectral adjustment; embodied grief in unvoiced scream and twitching fingers reveals contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with butterfly density and poem addition reconfiguring grief-carving; closure CR in "hollows until they become a shape we can all live in" lands with conceptual cost of accepting absence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse and butterflies constrain carving choice and charge lantern projection climax; dusk glass and wet soil filter through carver's tactile priorities, evolving with migration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to carve collective grief tightens accumulatively via crack-spectral-guidance sequence narrowing to hollows; agency in ribbon unspooling and poem addition forecloses old method with felt endurance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grief-as-hollows/door theme emerges organically from carving shift and butterfly trade; final table scene offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting poems and specters.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (stained-glass wings, starlight veins) consistent under stress; spectral dialogue subtextual and distinct, modulating to charged poise at dinner.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to thunder vibration; purposeful metaphors like "river of wings" enhance closure image without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship via chisel hollows and butterfly trade transforms grief trope into fresh, inevitable synthesis; risk in lyric migration pattern heightens closure stakes.</comment>
