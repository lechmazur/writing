<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's numb arm embodies internal conflict between silence and returning pain/music, culminating in earned choice to stay and hand over the bolt. Contradictory impulses act in scene via hesitation before giving the bolt. Pianist applies pressure through silent recognition. Final renunciation of silence feels compelled by prior discoveries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (bolt, discoloration, vibration, pianist) build density to Charged Poise closure where Elias hands bolt and fortress answers. Cost legible in "pain was returning in flickers, like distant music." Orientation anchored early (fortress, bellhop role). Single upward scene fits scope with one tightening via pianist reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bolt as recurring object constrains choice (pocketed, warms, handed over) and charges final image. Sensory details (molars thrum, snow like notes) selective via Elias's bias. Spatial choreography clear (staircase to fifth floor). Cobalt bruise color mirrors internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence vs. sound/safety) signaled early, escalates via pattern break (teacup shatters, fortress groans) under Accumulative lens, narrowing to endurance choice. Agency in tracing path and handing bolt forecloses silence with cost (pain returns). One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (safety as chosen silence) emerges organically via sewn lips, unpardonable sequence, numb arm; final hum/note reweights without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like "remaining was its own kind of sound." Invites ambiguity on guests' ignorance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (secrets like glass, pain as music). Voice texture (seraphically mundane) modulates rhythmically to swell in "note shook the walls." Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: lines layer action/atmosphere (e.g., "flakes hitting... like notes on a broken scale"). No loops, artifacts, or muddled metaphors; rhythm varies for propulsion. Zero scaffold in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bolt as piano key transforms haunted musician trope via silence-as-safety premise. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes without opacity. Inevitable hindsight in "bolt wasn’t part of the piano... key to rebuilding."</comment>
