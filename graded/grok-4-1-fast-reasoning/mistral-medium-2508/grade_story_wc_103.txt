<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied details like "clenched the halo fragment until her bones ached" and contradictory pull to run "sideways," earning the final renunciation of the center with visible cost in shaking hands; no unearned epiphanies, flaws drive struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup (fading photos to corridor screams) to cadence shift in hurling fragment, yielding CR closure ("texture...to survive") with legible cost in ragged breath and trembling arch; orientation anchored early in garden/maze, pattern taught without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory weave (ozone/crushed lavender, pulsing vines) filters through Liora's designer bias (fractal thorns, hyperbolic paths), constraining choices like "sideways" run and charging final "grain of time" image under palm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (endure time's texture) tightens accumulatively to woman's "trapped in when" warning, forcing agency in hurl/renunciation with felt cost (shaking hands, foreclosed trap); one decisive deepening suffices, pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of surviving texture emerges organically from photo-unfolding and rewoven filaments, resonant in non-literal final step "beside" the maze without moralizing; reweights premise via trapped woman's echo, ambiguity lingers in new edges.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in geometric/textural noticing ("hyperbolic curve," "grain of time"); rhythmic modulation peaks in terse climax ("She climbed," "She turned and ran"), woman's dialogue subtextual and distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "vines recoiled, then surged" advances action/atmosphere); consistent texture metaphors avoid muddle, varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops/artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic maze/time-fabric with halo's hunger transforms tropes (time loop, artifact); bold "sideways" turn from particulars risks poetic structure that heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
