<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism as shield cracks organically through embodied cues like the amber fly warming and father's shaking hands recalled at the terminal, compelling her hand-taking with visible cost of departure. Contradictory impulses (science vs. invitation) act in scene via micro-choices like tracing grooves and whispering the answer. Final choice earned by prior causality, no unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via patterned revelations (footprints to terminal to hologram), holding to CR closure where touching the galaxy reconfigures her belonging with cost (tower trembles, lab dusts). Orientation anchored early at tower base; no lens ambiguity. Cost legible in "Most never come back" line shaping her smile as promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sculptures' wrong order and dusty footprints constrain path-following choice; amber fly as micro-setting charges final image of remade glow. Sensory details (ozone/old paper, breath fogging metal) selective via Elara's priorities. Rainwashed tower evolves causally to rearranged path up.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (skepticism vs. cosmic invitation) signaled early, deepens accumulatively at terminal's "What do you miss?" forcing answer that narrows options. Agency in whispering truth and touching galaxy forecloses Earth path; cost felt in figure's warning and her defiant smile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of science as faith's language emerges via particulars: equation + (memory), stars remembering hands reweights premise without statement. Final image non-literally answers universe's homesickness, charging CR with ambiguity (promise vs. warning).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (e.g., "sculptures were wrong... in order"); rhythmic modulation peaks at trembling tower. Figure's dialogue ("rain on bronze") subtextual, goal-pursuing; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "amber fly pulsed faintly... answering"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful/consistent in lyric mode, propels to closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pilgrimage as receivable signal-key, transformed via amber inheritance and rearranging sculptures; hindsight-inevitable in "E=mc²… + (memory)". Bold risk in quiet CR heightens cosmic intimacy.</comment>
