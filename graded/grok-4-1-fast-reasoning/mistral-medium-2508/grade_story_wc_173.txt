<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied defiance in micro-choices like untangling threads without trembling, earning the final laugh; motivation to defy conformity roots actions consistently. Minor slip: "chaste" trait ornamental, not constraining choices with cost. Internal conflict subtle but present in smiles amid voices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from threads to echo absorption, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("snow melted where she stood") with conceptual cost of internalized voices. Orientation anchored early ("silver courtyard"); one tightening at gates opening suffices. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism dome and threads constrain untangling choices; snow/cold heighten bare feet stakes, charging final melting image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (frost traced by fingertips). Purposeful integration mirrors internal freedom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy conformity) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via thread resistances/voices narrowing to absorption; agency in letting echoes touch forecloses silence path. Cost legible in "humming with the weight of a thousand unstilled voices." Tightens once meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of defiance vs. conformity emerges organically from thread voices and final laugh; ending image ("snow melted where she stood") reweights lullaby premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like poet's sigh, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (poetic synesthesia: breath fogging, light as blades); rhythmic control modulates tension, compression under echo pressure purposeful. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (short peak sentences like "Her hands did not tremble"). Minor figurative density ("shards of light," "dying star") in climax but voice-consistent, no muddle or loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chaste courtesan harvesting echoes transforms defiance trope; prism threads as lives enable bold lyric risk that heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight from early "between sigh and smile."</comment>
