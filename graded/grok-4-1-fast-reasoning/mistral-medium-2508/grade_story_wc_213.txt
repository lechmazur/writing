<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to "favor listening" drives concrete micro-choices like rewoving bindings with slack, embodied in pulse quickening at aftertone warp; internal conflict with abbot's "credibly curious" caution yields earned adjustment without tidy epiphany. Minor reflection on backstory anchors to present (abbot's confession cues calculations) but slightly dilutes peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup (wind tremors to gales) narrows options to deliberate slack; Charged Poise closure in bell tolling "on its own" with felt risk of recklessness, cost legible in "the abbot would call it reckless." Orientation anchors early (climbing stairs to belfry).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Wind, rope, and spire constrain choices (wind steals resonance, forces slack); final image of churning clouds vs. balanced toll charges closure. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (microclimate shifts, bell hum in palm); no white-room, evolved with storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (true bell for valley) signaled early, tightens via aftertone detection forcing trade-off slack vs. tight bindings; agency in swift un/knotting narrows options under textural lens. Cost visible in deliberate risk amid gales; minor abstract valley salvation slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of listening over noise emerges from particulars (spaces between wails, clean note stitching storm); final lamp-lit wait reconfigures premise without moral, resonant via bell's blade-like cut. No overt statements; ambiguity in abbot's incomprehension lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (vibrations into marrow, wind's pitch); rhythmic modulation peaks in "note cutting through the gale like a blade," compression under stress purposeful. Distinct texture in syntax (short pulls amid lyric flow) heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm (short pulls in testing beats); metaphors coherent (clouds as restless sea mirrors internal balance). Minor figurative density in opening (breath curling, shroud hush) borders overwrite but patterns to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of siren-testing as listening craft in alpine sanctuary transforms storm trope; risk in unorthodox slack heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from microclimate method to self-tolling bell; no derivative echoes.</comment>
