<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied via cicada's warmth and ripple-watching; micro-choice of gifting cicada earns change with felt relational cost. Fisherman's grief applies crucible pressure without headcount blur. Minor slip in abstract "texture of time" summary slightly untethers from pivotal insight moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup in sensory layers to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "sleeve was damp, as if the cicada had wept." Orientation anchored by ~50 words in grotto/chronicler setup. Single-scene shards cohere without transition drag.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto drip and "moonlight pooled like spilled ink" constrain insight and charge hermit crab reprise; sensory hierarchy POV-filtered via chronicler's tidal bias. Stars and damp earth evolve with emotional cadence. Micro-setting (cicada/sleeve) indispensable to final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture/transitions amid grief) signaled early, tightens texturally as cicada warms and "shape of it" insight forecloses verbal explanation. Agency in tangential listening/gifting narrows to Charged Poise with lingering cost. Minor abstractness softens peak pressure legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of layered transitions emerges organically via ripple/cracked shell/damp sleeve images reweighting grief's premise without moralizing. Final "some textures were meant to linger" offers non-literal resonance to central question. Counter-readings (softening vs. submergence) add complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("ripples expand, then fade") biases toward textural noticing; rhythmic compression heightens grotto pause without elision opacity. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in "You don’t have to say it." Stable close-third POV with voice modulation under insight pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "cicada grew warm... like the air before a summer storm" advances sensation/stakes); varied syntax/paragraphs propel accumulatively. Purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle or loops. Zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal chronicler/cicada as textural oracle transforms grief trope via elliptical layering; risk in dream-submergence payoff heightens stakes organically. Cicada reprise feels inevitable in hindsight, committing to lyric premise without retreat.</comment>
