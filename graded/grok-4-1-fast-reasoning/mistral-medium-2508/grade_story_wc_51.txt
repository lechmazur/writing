<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to collect burdens roots deeply in her fractal weaver trait, with embodied interiority (patterns branching through bones, weights in ribs) and contradictory impulses peaking when child's fear lingers against her murmur. Final acceptance as the loom earns through prior causality, foreclosing escape with vanishing cost. Flawless single-POV execution elevates to exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building density of weights, hush, and flame interactions, tightening at grotto's exhale of its own burden into swirling embers. CR closure lands cleanly in "She was not the weaver. She was the loom," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of eternal merger, felt in her vanishing and eternal lamp.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bronze grotto's shingled plates, damp earth, and starlight fissures constrain choices (flame alignment with cracks, walls groaning back) and charge final image (pressing forehead to metal, breathed in). Sensory hierarchy (hum like struck bell, ice fracturing) mirrors internal hush perfectly. Micro-setting as pivotal tool anchors 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of calcifying burdens without self-dissolution escalates accumulatively: partial successes (grief/rage crumble) deepen to grotto's counter-push, narrowing options via swirling embers. Agency in tilting/singing forces realization trade-off; cost unmistakable in shadow walking beside her then eternal vanishing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of burdens as inescapable self/world emerges organically from particulars (kelp-thick grief, moth-wing fear calcifying then returning). Final image of hill-singing reconfigures collector/loom dialectic non-literally, embracing ambiguity without moralizing. Exceptional resonance from flawed acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (fractal branching, shingled hush) modulates rhythmically under pressure, stable third-close POV. Poetic diction taught early pays off legibly at closure without head-hopping or withholding. Rare prose-character fusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short fracture sounds amid longer reveries), zero loops/scaffolds; metaphors cohere (whalebone harp vibration) without muddle in peak beats like grotto shudder. Propulsion peaks in flame-twist sequence. Minor overwriting elsewhere doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh fractal-weaver premise transforms burden tropes into inevitable loom realization, with bold lyric risks (hush calcification) heightening stakes organically. Non-obvious synthesis of emotional weights and bronze ecology feels singular and hindsight-inevitable.</comment>
