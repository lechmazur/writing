<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in "question coiled in her ribs" and micro-choices like gathering cards reveal contradictory cling vs. unmake impulses, earning shift to canvas; minor diagnostic pullback in "This was how you painted truth" slightly undercuts raw contradiction at pivot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of walls/library pressure builds to CR closure—"fragments didn’t shatter. They floated"—with legible conceptual cost of self-unmaking; oriented early via tarot box cracks; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Recurring tarot box and walls constrain redesign choice and charge final floating image; sensory hierarchy (salt/parchment to ozone/ink) mirrors artist POV narrowing to fractures; evolving environment pressures without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unmake/enter dark tightens accumulatively via redesign turning collapse to doorway, agency in "hands moved without thought" foreclosing painter identity with cost in "lighthouse exhaled... swallowed it entirely."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of remaking fractures emerges organically via tarot shifts (Tower doorway, Hanged Man key) to resonant CR—"luminescent ache... world finally seen whole"—reweighting cling to surrender without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in fracture/thread metaphors sustains stable close-third POV; rhythmic modulation accelerates in redesign ("rhythm older than her"); purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "Tower’s collapse became a doorway"; figurative pattern (break/unmake) coherent and taught, but dense metaphors in peak redesign slightly risk muddle without full sparsity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tarot redesign as fracture-map transforms lighthouse trope into self-becoming; risk-taking lyric unmaking inevitable from early cracks to floating payoff, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
