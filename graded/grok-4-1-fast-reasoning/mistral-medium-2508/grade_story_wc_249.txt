<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's embodied rebellion—twitching fingers to frantic water-slapping—earns her mind's reclamation, with prior sabotages grounding the shift from theft to birth; contradictory impulses (drown vs. shape) act in the climax drumming.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensory density builds from lagoon ripples to memory release, culminating in Charged Poise CR where stars fracture and her mind clears, cost legible in "heart finally quiet" after unspooling prayer.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden reeds and lagoon constrain release—resonator bends time via frequencies—and charge final image of grief-free sky reflection; sensory hierarchy (inaudible hums, churning gold/violet) mirrors Lira's priorities under crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free mind from entangled sorrow) tightens via drumming frenzy coiling vines, forcing release trade-off; agency in hands-on water patterns forecloses drowning, cost felt in gasping memories dissolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of stolen dreams reclaiming wildness emerges via memory fish gasping free, resonant non-literal answer in lagoon cradling unbroken memory without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable, perceptual signature biased to synesthetic frequencies and watery glow; rhythmic modulation peaks in climax frenzy, compression taught early via humming reeds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels but figurative overload in climax ("gasping fish," "vines," "unspools") slightly muddles without pattern break; minor paraphrase in drumming motif, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic sci-fi memory-theft transformed by hands-drumming release, risk in lyric hush paying off in universe-breath CR; inevitable hindsight from garden resonator premise.</comment>
