<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's interior conflict—mending vs. letting unravel—manifests in embodied micro-choices like calloused fingers tracing knots and the needle hovering, culminating in an earned renunciation with cost (wearing threads as bracelets). Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the final beat, fulfilling 9+ test. Voice coherent and particular through silence accumulation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from weaving silence into net gaps to pattern break at knot unraveling ("The knot unraveled itself"), delivering RR/CR closure with legible cost in prisms shattering and spirits' laughter. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early ("prism sanctuary hummed... Elias knelt"). No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary constrains via splintered rainbows/whispers and trembling under gust, charging final shatter; starlight pools like blood in closure image, fulfilling 9+ test. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (salt-stiff net, kelp stench). Details evolve causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hold spirits via net pretense vs. release) tightens accumulatively to needle drop/unraveling, narrowing options with agency and on-page cost (door unlatched mirrors, prisms shatter). Escalation via density reweights pretense as lie; cost unmistakable in final gust/breath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of futile mending vs. authentic release emerges organically from net-as-lie particulars, resonant in final image ("shadow stretching... unbroken") reweighting wholeness without moralizing, fulfilling 9+ test. Subtext in woman's voice shift from warning to affirmation layers ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in biased noticing (silk as "spider’s patience," silence as mist); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure to closure. Woman's voice natural/subtextual. Distinct texture purposeful, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm supports ear test, but minor figurative density ("light bled... pooling like blood") borders overwriting without muddle in peak (knot unravel). No loops/artifacts; opening anchors stakes, final line recharges motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms restorer/spirits tropes via net pretense and "door" reconfiguration, risking lyric accumulation that heightens stakes organically. Bold voice commits to premise without retreat, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
