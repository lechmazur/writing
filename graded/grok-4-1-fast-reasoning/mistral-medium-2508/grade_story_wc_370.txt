<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in "pulse quickened—not from fear, but recognition," compelling the climb and door-locking choice with visible cost of ending recluse life; interiority particular via phantom limbs of unread books. Flawless arc under pressure integrates empathy as curse driving guilt to wisdom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via patterned paradox density to CR closure: "she locked the library door for the first time," reweighting hiding as threshold with conceptual cost of exposure. Orientation anchored early in stacks; no shards violate coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mirrors reflecting "endless libraries, each with a different Lena" constrain ascent choice and charge final image of street paradox; bakery/taxidermist frame filters through recluse bias. Sensory ozone/parchment nestles into action seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unearthing mistake wisdom tightens accumulatively to Voss confrontation and thesis annotation, narrowing hiding option with legible relational cost. Protagonist agency in pressing bookcase and locking door drives escalation without reversal excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of "wisest mistake is the one you refuse to bury" emerges via nested images (invitation loops, labyrinth cover) reweighting premise in final "turning of a page" without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in return promise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature via paradox-noticing ("sanctuary hidden in plain sight"); Voss dialogue subtextual ("You thought you were hiding") advances irony. Rhythmic modulation peaks in charged poise without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density in "ink bleeding as if the writer had hesitated"; syntax varies propulsion to closure image. Figurative purpose (phantom limbs) integrates without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-threshold transforms haunted trope via Voss reflection paradox and "nest inside the egg"; risk in mirror fragmentation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
