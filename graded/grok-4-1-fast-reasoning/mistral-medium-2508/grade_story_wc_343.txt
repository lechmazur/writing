<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's curiosity drives consistent micro-choices like sketching the board and tracing the map, earning the captain's trust; embodied reactions ("hums in her ribs," pulse jumps) reveal character under pressure without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density builds from phrasebook to board glow to ship alignment; closure RR lands cleanly in "the stranded luminance flared—then snapped into alignment" with weeks-adrift cost felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hopscotch board as micro-setting constrains the climactic jump choice and charges the final horizon image; sensory details like "trapped starlight" filter through Liora's pattern bias, evolving with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape loop) signaled early tightens accumulatively via Liora's discoveries narrowing to the jump; agency in leading the crew forecloses skepticism with on-page engine roar, though cost leans conceptual over visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of light/patterns in chaos emerges organically from board glow shifting to "the horizon was golden," reweighting strandedness as luminous beginning without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tight third-person POV stable with perceptual signature (patterns in starlings/clouds); sparse dialogue natural and advancing ("Show me how to jump"), distinguishing voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythmic prose propels via varied syntax and integrated imagery ("starling murmurations casting shifting shadows"); minor paraphrase of glow/luminance in late beats but purposeful for accumulative charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hopscotch board as magical pattern-breaker transforms airship trope ingeniously, synthesizing with starlings/light for inevitable closure; bold risk in lyric pattern payoff heightens stakes.</comment>
