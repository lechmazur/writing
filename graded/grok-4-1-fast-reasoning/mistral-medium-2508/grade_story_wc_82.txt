<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in folding grief yet letting basilica unfold; earned renunciation when "she let go," compelled by embodied pain rewriting her.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening to CR closure ("isle... rising... into the place where dreams are kept"); cost legible in "gem bit down" transforming her.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tea garden constrains as "stones shifted... tilting like a ship," charges final bloom; floating isle anchors early and reweights via unfolding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete basilica for daughter's voice) deepens via gem press under lens; agency in reaching through pane forecloses self with bite's cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief's unfolding emerges via cranes/paper/dreams; resonant CR reweights premise without moral, as basilica "breathes."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("facets catching... breath held too long") stable in single POV; rhythm modulates to charged poise at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Purposeful density in peak ("pain... rewrote"); minor metaphor pile-up in descent beat slightly muddles but pattern-taught lyric sustains propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-recording basilica unfolding isle; risk in lyric compression inevitable in hindsight via cranes' flight.</comment>
