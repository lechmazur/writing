<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied interiority peaks when gear turns against skin, compelling micro-choice to reach for shadow; earned renunciation of wandering shows contradictory impulses resolving with cost. Minor abstraction in epiphanic summaries slightly tempers peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup to CR closure ("frontier wasn’t out there"); cost legible in shedding edges and leaving gear, with pattern taught early in wind/method. One tightening enters fractal clearing, reweighting stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest constrains method (ironwoods/copper ferns trigger threads) and charges final image (forest stands with him); selective sensory bias (binary rustles, ozone scent) mirrors internal wildness without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to unravel hum tightens texturally via wind thread to clearing shadows, narrowing to internal endurance; agency in listening/press gear, cost felt in path foreclosure ("no longer needed to wander"). Minor abstractness in "probable miracles" slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mind's wild frontier emerges implicitly via gear/forest fusion, resonant CR in walking "with it" reweights premise without moral; returning hum/shadow images shift meaning organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (taste shape of ideas, bones as tuning forks) biases noticing mechanically; rhythmic modulation accelerates in clearing beat, stable close third-person with purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density in sensory propulsion, varied rhythm passes ear test; overwriting in stacked metaphors ("vines coiled around brass trunks... binary rustles") during opening slightly dulls momentum, but pattern coheres without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Steampunk-philosophical synthesis transforms tropes via fractal trees/geared bird; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight when gear left "winking" recharges motif organically.</comment>
