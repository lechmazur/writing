<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's micro-choices under pressure, like waiting for eyes to adjust and using the mainspring barrel, reveal a hierarchy of values tied to his observant, ghost-seeing nature. Internal consistency shines in his shift from tracing cracks to unmaking the mechanism, earned by prior revelations. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously prevents 9+; no deep embodied hesitation mid-unmaking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns build to crack revelation, mechanism exposure, and unmaking for CR closure with legible cost in "Silence rushed in, thick and final." Single scene anchors who/where/when by para 2; no orientation debt. One tightening suffices as density reweights the paused circus premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust accumulation and cracks as micro-setting constrain choices, charging the final image where "The cracks in the ceiling were just cracks now." Sensory details (popcorn smell, pulsing fractures) filter through Elias's priorities, evolving causally. Recurring dust/plaster guides action without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ceiling secrets) signaled early tightens accumulatively via dust analysis to barrel-click to unmaking, narrowing options with shaking hands as felt cost. Agency in "loosened the gears’ anchor bolts" forecloses restart path. One deepening suffices; ghosts' tension adds pressure without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of performance's weightless burden emerges organically from paused mechanism and ghosts' entrapment, reweighted in pendulum's shattering laugh and fading relief. Final image answers via CR without moralizing: burden unwound. Particulars like child's laugh avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in ghosts' freedom cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature: horologist's eye on dust/gears, modulating rhythm under stress (short sentences at unmaking). Whispered dialogue natural, subtextual ("They forgot to wind it down"). No head-hopping; diction biased to Elias's trade.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances via image-action fusion, like "pressed the barrel’s cool metal... listened. The building exhaled." Varied rhythm passes ear test; purposeful metaphors (dust as language) taught early, no muddle or loops in peak beats. Zero scaffold; opening/final lines recharge motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost circus powered by eternal mechanism, unwound via repairman's tools, transforms abandonment trope into time-trapped performance. Risky lyric compression pays off in charged closure; irreplaceable mainspring reprise heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
