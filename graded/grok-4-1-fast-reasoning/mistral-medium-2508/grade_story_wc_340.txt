<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like throat tightening at the child's sketch; final realization earned by prior curiosity with visible cost of accepting cold. Contradictory impulses (despair vs. hope) act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: diary revelations deepen across elevator beats, culminating in on-page CR ("ice didn’t just glint—it burned") with conceptual cost of cold as clarity's price. Orientation anchored immediately; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Spire's icebound details constrain climb and charge final image (fractured stars on parapets); sensory selection POV-biased toward light/scattering, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (joy beneath anguish) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via diary to stance crystallization; agency in sustained attention forecloses prison view with felt cost, though lacks sharper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (numbers as joy metrics, spire as lens); final image resonantly reweights premise without moralizing, embracing complexity of cold's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (light refraction, breath fogging); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, prose-as-character reflects inquisitive mind without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (e.g., "light like broken promises") integrated into action; no loops, varied rhythm propels ascent, zero artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data-chasing joy in frozen isolation, spire-as-lens twist inevitable from particulars; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
