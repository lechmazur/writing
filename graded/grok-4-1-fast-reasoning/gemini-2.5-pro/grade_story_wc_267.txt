<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (silence as vocation vs accusation) act simultaneously on the stair; final bolt delivery earned by endured deliveries to 313 and pocket-worrying, with relational cost legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silence/stain/bolt motifs tightens to Charged Poise closure in tray placement/knock; cost felt in "fragile...thaw" against prior frostbite endurance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Spiral staircase stain/discoloration anchors and constrains reflective pause on nineteenth step; bolt as recurring micro-object charges final door image with tactile contrast to white linen.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safety's cost via silence) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through stair endurance to agency in bolt-leaving, foreclosing evasion with vulnerability cost in "warmer" lungs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silence-as-safety theme emerges organically from omission flashback, stair ghost-stain, and bolt "question mark"; final thaw reweights premise without statement, embracing ambiguity of her response.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in "seraphically mundane" movements and "phantom tingle" embodiment; rhythmic control modulates from muffled percussion to "sure and even" steps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (e.g., "rust-colored smear" triggers splintering memory without summary); varied syntax propels to crisp closure image, no loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ex-countertenor bellhop's bolt-guilt in fortress transforms guilt/healing tropes; stair stain as memory snag and final bolt delivery risk charged poise without gimmick.</comment>
