<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority rooted in father's legacy drives micro-choices like peering through the scuff and breaking the seal, with embodied emotion in "fingers over the wood." Contradictory impulses (truth vs. disbelief) act in scene, earning final renunciation of doubt. Minor abstract phrasing like "thread this labyrinth" slightly dilutes embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from whispers to peering revelation (DC via impossible sight), culminating in CR closure when narrator breaks seal, reweighting legacy with cost of disbelief ("they will hear only the echoes of my father’s fictions"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening suffices. Cost legible in final claim: "the hush is mine now."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "copperlight repose" and "shadows held their breath" filter through POV urgency, with lattice and door constraining peering choice and charging tableau image. Setting evolves causally to heap of bones; micro-object (scratch) shapes inciting sight. No white-room; jagged reef isolates stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (own true story vs. liar's son) signaled early, tightens via impossible witness forcing seal-break agency; Accumulative deepening reweights options with disbelief cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise in "Let them have their doubts." Minor: no internal-external weave, but single-POV fits scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of real vs. invented monsters emerges organically from tableau vs. father's fictions, with final CR image ("lighthouse will remember") resonantly reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in betrayal trinity mirrors narrator's inheritance. Complexity lingers in plausible disbelief counter-reading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct first-person voice with perceptual signature ("salt air failed to erode certain sorrows") modulates rhythmically under revelation pressure; POV stable, no leakage. Poetic compression taught early pays off in charged closure image. No dialogue; elision of exact break serves CR legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image-packed sentences; opening "copperlight repose" anchors voice. Minor paraphrase loop in "narrow door left ajar for decades" (repeated phrasing) dulls one beat (−0.4); no filter stacks or muddled metaphors touch closure. Propulsion clear to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: frozen murder tableau in confessional lattice transforms haunted prison trope via physics anomaly, with bold CR closure risking disbelief for truth-claim. Irreplaceable "trinity of deceit" image heightens thematic risk; no derivative echoes.</comment>
