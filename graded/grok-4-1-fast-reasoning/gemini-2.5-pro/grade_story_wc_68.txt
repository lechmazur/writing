<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silas's interiority shines in embodied agony ("cold weight settling in his gut") and contradictory impulses (convert vs. preserve), earning the final renunciation as memory-keeper with isolation's cost. Blind spots in Sun-Kissed ignorance drive his dispassionate resolve without safety-hedging. Girl's reaction tests but reinforces his stance, revealing character through micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from haul to cog discovery, agony, intrusion, Charged Poise closure as he boxes the cog, reconfiguring mission from conversion to pure preservation with legible resignation cost in final image. Single scene, orientation anchored early ("main junction of the sewer system"). No causality breaks; persistent constraint of sewer isolation shapes all.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sewer gallery vividly tactile (rhythmic drip, sedimentary muck layers), constraining choices (cold ache as sacrifice) and charging closure (quiet dark as memory's domain). POV-biased details (strata as truth) mirror internal states without overt symbolism. Sunken ruins pressure via contrast to Sun-Kissed world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve genius vs. futility) signaled early, deepens via girl's rejection narrowing options to endurance. Agency in renunciation forecloses teaching path with felt isolation cost. Accumulative pressure coheres to Charged Poise; one tightening sufficient, legible in pivot from imagined seed-planting to stubborn memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Competing narratives emerge organically from cog's precision vs. ghost-sickness myth, resonating in final box image reweighting premise (truth's erasure cost). Subtext in girl's retreat and Silas's brittle laugh invites ambiguity without tidy moral. Theme inextricable from endurance arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (rational layers over myths) with rhythmic diction modulating to calm resolve. Dialogue subtextual and distinct (Silas's flat dryness vs. girl's whisper), advancing pressure. No head-hopping; voice biases noticing (cog's fine pitch as genius).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm mirroring reflective poise to final cadence; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures. Opening anchors stakes; final line recharges cog motif through precise image. Concrete over generic throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sewer archivist's rational rebellion transforms post-apoc trope via cog's longitude genius vs. myths, with bold quiet stasis risking minimalism but earning hindsight inevitability. Voice/setting cohere as singular vision; no hedging.</comment>
