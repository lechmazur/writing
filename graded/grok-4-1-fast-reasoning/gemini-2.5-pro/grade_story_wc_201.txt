<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Proprioceptively enhanced interiority yields concrete, contradictory impulses ("displaced rooted"); final purposeful grip on strap earns renunciation of escape with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as trauma-memories densify to CR at tree: "prove us wrong. Find its logic, or perish"; conceptual cost ("perish in the static") reconfigures premise on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>UV light's "weight, pressure" and soil hum constrain brace action; bone-white tree as focal point charges final image, sensory hierarchy POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (mercy's math vs. perish) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via body triggers to agency in bracing/understanding; cost legible in foreclosed escape, purposeful search.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Forest-as-crucible reweights "cold equations" premise through particulars; final image non-literally answers via charged poise, ambiguity lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in "crystalline awareness," "micro-gram accuracy"; rhythmic control heightens pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (e.g., "symphony of self-knowledge" advances body/atmosphere); varied rhythm propels to closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Proprioceptively enhanced" survivor and "ultraviolet penance" transform interrogation trope into mercy-quest crucible; synthesis inevitable, risk heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
