<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in noticing decay compels gardening and confrontation; contradictory impulses (hoarding vs. planting) act in scene. Patrolman applies pressure via memory share. Final endurance earned with cost in fragile seeing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: decay details build to gardening beat, confrontation tightens, closure as charged poise in nod and green specks with tenuous cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Courtyard fissures constrain planting choices; ivy/moss mirror decay vs. life, charging closure image of specks from stone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defiance vs. erasure) signaled early, tightens at patrolman arrival forcing uncloak; cost felt in foreclosed punishment and fragile peace under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacred in ordinary emerges via seeds/bread, resonates in final dirt-under-nails image reweighting loss without moral state.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in decay noticing; dialogue natural/subtextual via Miller's ghost, distinct voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel momentum; minor opening metaphor density supports textural lens without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh guerrilla gardening defiance transforms decay trope; bread/memory turn inevitable from particulars.</comment>
