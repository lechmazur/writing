<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to salvage purity drives consistent micro-choices like deepening trance and weaving dream-images, with embodied sorrow in the melted globe. Boy's silent clutching and final smile reveal character through action, not labels. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak weave (no visible hesitation) prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dream-cameos build density to shared dreamscape, resolving in CR via boy's smile and globe-shake reweighting sorrow to lightness with conceptual cost of exposed truth. Orientation anchors early (shrine, vigil). Closure image ("profound lightness") makes before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glacier shrine constrains trance (candle dips, air heavy), charging final pick-up of globe; dream-ocean/outpost tethers psychic action. Sensory bias (blue ice, weeping walls) reflects Elara's perceptual signature. Recurring ice/globe motif mirrors internal release without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvage boy's truth) signaled early, escalates via trance-deepening and image-weaving under accumulative lens, narrowing to expose man's lie with cost (facade dissolution). Boy's smile crystallizes release. No reversal, but single deepening suffices; abstract "lie solidified" slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging purity emerges via globe's shift from prison to memorial, boy's smile repricing wreckage without moralizing. Subtext in man's eclipse and Elara's whisper builds irony from dream-fragments. Final image ("borrowed starlight feels... her own") resonates non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (dreams as ocean, ice as history-weeping); rhythmic prose modulates from vigilant to heavy in trance. Voice texture distinct (poetic diction like "breath-hollowed space"). Phantom dialogue sparse, subtextual ("It was an accident").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "melted snow globe... epicenter of the sorrow"); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("human eclipse," "smoke") risks coherence in peak weave, but no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Read-aloud flows clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dream-cameos as collective unconscious signals transform ghost story into psychic salvage op. Risky trance-theater payoff feels inevitable from globe-signal setup. No derivative echoes; bold dream-outpost pivot heightens ingenuity.</comment>
