<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in preserving wonder drives all actions consistently, embodied in "quiet, burning thing" and final satisfaction. Interiority concrete via physical sensations like "thrumming faintly against his palms." Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, keeping it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: process builds density to wind's arrival and symphony. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in "beautiful, deliberate self-destruction," releasing truth at ice's cost. Orientation anchored early; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "keening wind" and "frozen blues of millennia" filter through Elian's resonant perception. Bluff and updraft constrain sculpture's activation, charging final glistening image. Environment shapes climax without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to release fading truth tightens via wind's rare updraft, forcing crescendo with self-destruction cost. Accumulative escalation reweights via density increase; agency in precise carving enables payoff. Entry to 8.8+ via visible price in melting ice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth as resonance emerges organically from ice's song to collective renewal, reweighted in final "echo of its truth." No moralizing; resonant non-literal close in horizon gaze. Final image answers preservation question with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of sonic embodiment ("resonance felt in the bones"). Rhythmic prose modulates from "muted vigor" to crescendo's flow. Distinct texture purposeful, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies naturally, accelerating to "symphony grew." No loops, artifacts, or muddled metaphors; purposeful figures like "frozen tears" enhance without overwriting. Propulsion clear through closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ice-as-memory, post-verbal world, and kinetic truth-release transforms craftsman trope. Risk in self-destructing sculpture heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from particulars; bold without gimmickry.</comment>
