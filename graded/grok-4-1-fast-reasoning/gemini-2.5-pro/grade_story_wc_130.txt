<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in "empty space beside him in bed, the silence where her humming should be"; micro-choices like tracing fissures reveal hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses in pain smoothed by memories dovetail into earned peace. Final endurance of loss with cost (void framed, not erased) satisfies 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tending to ritual invitation, pattern break in hum/glow, cadence shift to fading lattice reconfigures grief. On-page RR (Charged Poise) with cost in "vast, dark polygon" made legible. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mosaic stone depressions constrain placement of eyes, charging final lattice image. Sensory hierarchy (wet limestone, dripping stalactites) reflects inventive POV bias. Micro-setting (chipped cobalt tiles) guides choice, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quantify ambiguous loss) signaled early, tightens via ritual deepening that narrows to interlocking patterns. Agency in "quiet invitation" forecloses formless grief with felt cost in projection. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens; 9+ test met in lattice's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief's geometry emerges from lattice image reweighting absence/presence without statement. Final "seedling in the dark, fertile ground" offers non-literal resonant answer. Particulars (Lyra's fingerprints in grout) build complexity, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in "language of light and stone." Rhythmic control modulates from patient description to peak intensity in glow; no head-hopping. Diction biased toward mathematical invention, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with lines like "jagged edges... smoothed by swirling lines" doing triple duty (action, image, theme). Varied rhythm passes ear test; minor figurative density in projection beat but purposeful, no loops or artifacts touching closure. Satisfies 9+ test narrowly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxidermy eyes, mosaic math-magic, and grief geometry feels inevitable in lattice theorem. Risk in abstract-concrete fusion heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming loss trope. +0.3 for bold premise commitment.</comment>
