<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through scent cataloging and draining psychometry; final renunciation earned by accumulated revelations, with embodied cost in "her own breath misting." Contradictory impulses subtle in resisting vial impulse at lagoon.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via scent density and pattern breaks (factory silence to hinged door); closure as Charged Poise RR/CR lands on-page with legible cost in leaving compass ("finally at rest") and carrying "resonant hush," reconfiguring purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy via petrichor bias constrains choices (fissure breath pulls her); limestone tools/hinge and glowing lagoon charge final image, mirroring internal shift from "ephemeral" to "resonant hush."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (explanation-failing scent) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via psychometry deepening (drains her, narrows path); agency in pressing wall forecloses capture option with on-page cost at lagoon edge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of impossibility emerges organically from particulars (starlight petrichor, expedition remnants); final image non-literally reweights collecting premise via compass-leaving, with conceptual cost of uncageable "ghost."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in olfactory texture ("petrichor unlike any"); rhythmic control modulates from catalog hush to lagoon vastness, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "stone pivoted inward on a natural, water-worn fulcrum"); zero loops, varied syntax accelerates to closure image without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of petrichor profession and geologic hinge transforms cave trope; "starlight and stone" scent and compass psychometry feel inevitable, risking lyric mode for resonant payoff.</comment>
