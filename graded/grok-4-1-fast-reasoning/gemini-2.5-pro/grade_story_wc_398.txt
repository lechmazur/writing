Contradictory impulses act in fire memory recall versus present tending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase in reflective beats tightening to CR closure ("something within him had shifted"); cost legible in pocket slip and wind-rustled alignment.
