<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Motivation to trace origins intensifies through concrete micro-choices like prying the drawer; earned CR closure via solitary re-indexing commitment with felt cost of quiet correction; contradictory calm amid ugly truth shown in "profound sense of peace" after theft confirmation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from blackout stillness to stamp match; on-page CR closure reconfigures history's premise with conceptual cost of erasure admitted; orientation anchored early in Athenaeum amid drip and biolamps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Phosphorescent moss constrains discovery by forcing posture readjustment, charging final clutched-stamp image; sensory details like "saline-treated paper" and "drip of condensation" filter through indexer POV; setting evolves causally from lumens failure to reclaimed quiet.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of honest origins deepens via hypothesis-to-match tightening under accumulative lens, narrowing to theft realization; agency in retrieving/using stamp forecloses sanitized history path; cost legible in "long, slow work" of solitary reclamation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth amid erasure emerges organically from frond-mark reveal without statement; final "silent partner in his meticulous, solitary reclamation" offers resonant CR reweighting histories' nobility; ambiguity in calm acceptance lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature of tranquil noticing (e.g., "faint symmetry"); rhythmic control modulates from hum's death to ending poise; diction like "dappled gloom" biases toward clarifying calm without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with lines like "shape was too deliberate, too organic" advancing image and hypothesis; varied rhythm propels from shriek of wood to clutched texture; no loops or artifacts, purposeful elevated diction fits indexer voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh sunken-library premise transformed via coral stamp's maker-mark twist on acquisition logs; risk in quiet CR ending heightens thematic stakes of erasure; synthesis of hydrospheric details feels inevitable to indexer's perceptual world.</comment>
