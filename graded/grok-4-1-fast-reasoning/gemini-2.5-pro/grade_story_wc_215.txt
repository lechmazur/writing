<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—guarding silence vs. releasing it—act in the fumbling with the latch and opening, earning the final gaze with visible cost of ended vigil. Interiority concrete and particular, embodied in weathered hands and reverence-as-trespass. No unearned epiphanies; change stems from contextual pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observations (Lyra's pointing, ghost swirls) builds to RR closure in box-opening and nod, reconfiguring silence with shared cost legible in dissolving ghosts and "weight...now shared." Orientation anchored in para 1; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring box and wasteland (hives, lavender husks) constrain unearth/open choices and charge final image of luminescence/phanto spring. Sensory hierarchy (visual haze, honey scent) POV-biased to recluse's calm; evolves causally from dust-buried to light-spilling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve unspoken words) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via clues to box-opening agency, narrowing options with deepening knowledge of shared anchor. Cost unmistakable in "perpetual shock" yielding to bearable weight, foreclosing isolation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence's weight emerges organically from honeycomb souls and gaze "that held entire conversations," offering resonant non-literal answer in nod/release without moralizing. Final image reweights covenant via shared light, embracing ambiguity of enduring ache.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature of tranquil observation; rhythmic diction ("silence of ghosts, shimmering in the heat haze") modulates to charged poise at climax. No head-hopping; elisions (past fire) anchor to present cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to closure without loops; no scaffold or filter stacks dull peak (latch-click to luminescence clean). Minor figurative density ("curdled into perpetual shock") purposeful, voice-motivated for tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Honeycomb souls as vessel for unspoken words transforms ghost trope into fresh synthesis of apiary loss/silence, inevitable in hindsight via early afterimages → release. Bold lyric risk (mute communication) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
