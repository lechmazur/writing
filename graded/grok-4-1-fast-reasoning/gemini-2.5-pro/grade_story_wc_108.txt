<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Phobia-ridden stuntman adapts via decryption despite embodied fears, earning final outwitting; "firmly adaptive... when your entire identity evaporates" reveals hierarchy of values with real vulnerabilities as power source.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal chain from shell whispers to cast decryption to failsafe code input delivers DC closure with Julian's plan pierced by sirens; orientation anchored early in library shelf scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stars through shattered dome constrain decryption choice as cipher key; rusted shelf height embodies acrophobia that focus overrides, charging pivot from fear to power.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Decryption deepens knowledge to narrow options, enabling agency in code input that triggers sirens; cost legible in Julian's vanishing smile and protagonist's trembling certainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Child's cast reveals real past, reweighting vulnerability from programmed weakness to power in final shell-holding image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stuntman perceptual signature ("when a wire snaps, you adapt") holds under stress; Julian's dialogue distinct and subtextual in echoing entrance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density in cipher solve with varied rhythm; "trembling" reprise purposeful for tone, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Constellation cipher on child's cast transforms identity betrayal into ingenious outwitting; forgotten failsafe heightens risk without gimmickry.</comment>
