<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied via geode's warmth and knuckles whitening; motivation intensifies grief into cosmic hunt with earned final trajectory. Contradictory impulses subtle in bleak exhilaration, fueling micro-choices like refining equations under duress. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("unfiltered awakening") slightly abstracts peak resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of grief/data builds to CR closure in "cascading solution solidified... a single, piercing spike." Orientation anchored early in observatory post-strike; cost legible in breaker reset threatening cache as she stares unmoving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory micro-setting constrains via ticking capacitor and cooling breakers, charging final thump-click; geode as recurring object mirrors internal states and reflects coordinates. Sensory hierarchy (visual Earth lie, tactile console) reflects scientific/grieving POV. Body/tool integration tightens choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate potential reservoir) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via chime and breaker reset narrowing window; agency in equation refinements forecloses paths with felt cost in unstable cache. Escalation driven by her endurance under time pressure to discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic theft emerges organically from perturbation ripples and unused potential's hum, resonating in final geode/coordinates image reweighting loss without moralizing. Subtext in grief as "tangible force" layers complexity; no tidy resolution, ambiguity lingers in ongoing hunt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature blending physics/grief bias; voice texture poetic yet precise, modulating rhythm in peak ("fingers flew... cascading solution"). No head-hopping or withholding; diction reflects stressed focalizer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but overwrought metaphors ("needle in her soul," "cold, dense star") cluster in discovery beat, slightly muddling propulsion; minor paraphrase on grief echo. Strong verbs and image propulsion overall; closure line clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone grief and quantum perturbation hunt transforms sci-fi tropes; conceptual ingenuity in "resonance of a life that should have been" feels inevitable, risking bold CR closure without gimmick.</comment>
