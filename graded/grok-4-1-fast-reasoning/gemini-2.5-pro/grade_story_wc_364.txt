<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's quietly determined spirit shows in contradictory impulses—terror of the silk's power yet deliberate descent—culminating in earned barter with felt memory loss. Interiority embodied via lost sensory memories ("sharp, sweet burst"). Final endurance forecloses personal past for planetary gain, scaled perfectly to length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: texture builds from surface decay to cavern pulse to sky arch stabilization as Charged Poise RR. Orientation anchored early (blacksmith, failing orchards, shafts). Closure cost legible in "hollowed out" emergence and stabilized arch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Floating arches and shafts constrain path (ignores main roads, wounds for healing); geode as micro-setting charges climax. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (stone scent, geothermal pulse). Final arch lines reweight decay with blue energy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax resilience) signaled early, tightens via barter deepening—personal memories for planetary pulse—with visible cost altering Elian. Accumulative pressure coheres to Charged Poise; no coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice-for-resilience emerges organically via barter images, reweighted in final arch (whisper against roar). Protagonist arc inextricable; ending image answers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (hope as "stubborn material," silk as "captured twilight"). Rhythmic control modulates from measured calm to humming pitch rise under ritual stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy descent lines to humming cadence); no loops or artifacts. Propulsion peaks in "azure light bloomed... heartbeat," charging closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-barter fantasy with quiet defiance transforms tropes (magician's curse healed via personal loss). Risky lyric closure inevitable from early silk intuition.</comment>
