<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frugal traits shown concretely through "not a single grain of dust or drop of water was wasted," compelling the ritual's precision; interiority particular without epiphanies. Minor slip: internal conflict mostly serene devotion, lacking contradictory impulses in peak kneel moment, but micro-choices earn closure endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as preparations densify to hum and nebula bloom; orientation anchored by para 1 (Kavi, ziggurat, interregnum). Closure as Charged Poise/CR: nebula reveal reconfigures devotion with conceptual cost ("piece of his soul") legible in "shared secret" image; persistent thrift constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian dust circle and chalk-water lines constrain ritual choices, charging dismantling image; sensory selection (hum "perceived, like the universe breathing") POV-biased to astronomer. Ziggurat "clawed at the violet sky" mirrors devotion without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reveal cosmic secret) signaled early, tightens via alignment mirroring ("star-patterns... perfectly mirror his schematic"); agency in schematic transpositions forecloses failure path. Accumulative deepening reweights with nebula pulse, but cost mostly conceptual, slightly abstract vs. visceral in peak reveal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of thrifty devotion yielding cosmic reward emerges from particulars (magic square to star-cloud); final dismantling image resonantly reweights "conservation" without moral. Ambiguity in "empirically ironic" miracle invites reflection, inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature ("hoarded silence and starlight"); rhythmic modulation builds to thickened starlight in climax. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at CR closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "frugality of his movements was hypnotic" advances char/atmos); varied rhythm, no loops. Minor figurative density in setup ("bled from the horizon") borders overwriting but pattern-taught for dusky tone, not obscuring nebula peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Babylonian math ritual unveiling nebula transforms tropes organically; risk in "schematic prayer" heightens stakes via empirical devotion. Inevitable hindsight from thrift buildup to mind-vault treasure.</comment>
