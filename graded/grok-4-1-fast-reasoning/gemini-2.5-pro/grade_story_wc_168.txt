<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to enlighten via vulnerability is embodied in scar-tracing and box-handling, earning Kaelen's realization; internal conflict in past "stupid choice" shows contradictory impulses. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "bargained innocence" whispered feels slightly unearned mid-reflection. Final micro-choice of offering box reveals values hierarchy with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setting to backstory reveal, culminating in CR closure via Kaelen's tracing mirroring Elias, reweighting innocence with scar/box cost legible in "fractured relic." Single scene anchored early (ridge, moon by para 1). No orientation debt; lens taught implicitly via reflective progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge and Perseids constrain reflective intimacy, charging box fissures under "pale light"; pines and smoke filter through firefighter POV bias. Recurring celestial "slow dance" mirrors final understanding, evolving with emotional cadence. Body/scar as micro-setting enables "gently skilled" touch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating fire's cost escalates accumulatively via deepening backstory reveal, narrowing to vulnerability choice; Kaelen's grasp forecloses naivety with felt scar cost. Agency in Elias's sharing forces stance crystallization. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of traded perfection emerges organically from box rescue and scars, resonating in final trace without moralizing; "bargained innocence" echoes concept but dramatized via past choice. Counter-reading in girl's refusal adds ambiguity. Final image reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV focalized on Elias with perceptual signature in fire imagery ("house screaming"); dialogue distinct—Elias's rumble vs. Kaelen's hesitant. Rhythmic control modulates from distant rumble to quiet trace. No head-hopping; subtext in silences advances.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., scar-trace embodies emotion/action); rhythm varies, read-aloud strong without loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("granite spine") fits voice but risks elevation in peak reflection. Propulsion peaks at closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mentorship via porcelain relic from inferno transforms firefighter trope; box's shift from girl's to Elias's inevitable in hindsight. Risk in quiet CR ending heightens scar stakes organically, no hedging.</comment>
