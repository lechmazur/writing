<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between truth compulsion and protecting Lena's memory act in the attunement beat; final partial answer to neighbor earns change via prior causal buildup with trade-off cost of truffles and storm risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal chain from affliction to relic attunement to neighbor test delivers on-page Decisive Change with felt cost (stopped compulsion pressure); lens holds tightly, orientation anchored by orchard/ravine in first paragraph, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ravine orchard and storm constrain attunement choice (environmental turmoil required) and charge final image of "battered but beautiful canopy"; sensory details (wind scream, rain hammer) filtered through forager's symbiotic lens mirror internal fractured grace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of psychological safety tightens via attunement agency under causal lens, narrowing truth-compulsion options; cost legible in on-page test where words "stopped" after pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as bastion against chaos emerges organically from relic occlusion and final partial truth; "silent, cerulean guardian" reweights truth-virus premise with non-literal resonance on prior orchard/storm particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (rational symbiosis in "oak roots and Tuber melanosporum"); rhythmic modulation peaks in attunement whisper, brief neighbor dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with no loops/artifacts, varied syntax accelerates storm beat ("Wind screamed, and sheets of rain hammered"); concrete images propel without overwriting, closure image crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-virus truth affliction, truffle-forager logic, and glass-eye relic transforms isolation trope; risky ravine setting heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
