<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as logical dreamer compels precise micro-choices like adjusting the pattern post-failure; interiority embodied in breath catching at gauge dip. Contradictory caution from prior "violent spike" acts alongside bold trial, earning closure endurance. Final mind-turn to next pattern reveals hierarchy of values with ongoing cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern setup densifies to tide catalyst, gauge dip-rise as cadence shift reconfigures timeline vitality. Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost in "plunging towards zero" then stable ascent. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto's phosphorescence, drip, hum constrain observation and catalyze via tide submerging pattern. Sensory hierarchy (tactile damp sand, visual blaze) narrows with urgency at gauge climax. Final scattered shells charge image, mirroring spent equation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (timeline vitality) signaled early, tightens via dip reversal forcing trade-off before stable rise under accumulative lens. Agency in pattern creation drives escalation; cost legible in miscalculation fear and inert remnants.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hope as puzzle emerges via failed revolution to resilient pattern, final "new stanza in its song" reweights premise non-literally. Resonance from particulars like whelk spirals avoids platitudes; quiet complexity lingers in "not final victory."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with lucid perceptual signature (interdimensional hum only she perceives); diction/rhythm modulates serene to charged at tide apex. Prose texture distinct in recursive phrasing echoing fractals.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to gauge settlement; no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in setup ("tidal breath") purposeful without muddling peak dip-rise clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quantum shells in grotto transform gauge into timeline meter organically; fresh synthesis of math-hope via tide ritual risks serene fantasy without gimmick. Closure reweighting feels inevitable from prior failure reference.</comment>
