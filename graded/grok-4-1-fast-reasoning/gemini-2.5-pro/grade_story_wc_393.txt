<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Arthur's interior conflict between faith and fact is embodied in his "leaden" heart and final peace washing over guilt; Elias applies crucible pressure via insight. Earned change in Arthur's nod and resolve forecloses repairman self-view with felt cost. Distinct voices in dialogue; no diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via clockwork exam and light metaphor to CR closure where Arthur's realization reconfigures his role ("pointing out the cracks") with undeniable emotional cost in the "warming his weary spirit" line. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via Elias's lockbox reveal suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunlight piercing clouds charges final image, constraining Arthur's realization and mirroring theme without overt symbolism. Shop details (dust motes, brass) tactile and selective via chaplain's expectant quiet bias. Spatial choreography coherent; weather evolves causally to payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mechanics of despair) signaled early, deepens via Elias's lever point and light image narrowing Arthur's options from fixer to guide. Agency in presenting heart and leaving it; cost legible in reframed guilt. Lens-appropriate cadence shift at sunlight spear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unearned forgiveness emerges organically via lockbox/heart and impartial light, reweighting premise in final "cracks in the clouds" image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; Elias's thumb on seam ties subtext to action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited on Arthur with perceptual signature (quiet as "louder"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven (Elias's "that's not how it works"). Rhythmic control modulates from hush to vibrant hush; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines multi-job (e.g., "felt hammers" evokes voice and shop). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (light/hush). Zero artifacts in peak realization beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clockwork soul as "lockbox" transforms redemption trope via repairshop logic; fresh synthesis of chaplain/prisoner dynamic in light's impartiality. Risk in quiet CR payoff heightens stakes organically; no derivative echoes.</comment>
