<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between duty and saturation act in scene via swan-folding choice; earned stasis of temporary renewal compelled by Aeridor's looped screams; no unearned epiphanies, embodied in ghosts and whispers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echoes breaks via burrowing to Charged Poise closure by river; cost legible in "would eventually have to trace its folds again," foreclosing permanence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge and starlight river constrain renewal and charge final image; sensory details (ozone shift, yielding water) mirror internal scrubbing of echoes through POV-biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of saturation tightens accumulatively to burrow-deepening; agency in folding swan forces trade-off of temporary stasis; cost felt in cycle's inevitability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final river-watch reweights history's weight with non-literal renewal amid noise; theme emerges organically from swan-burrow particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "ghosts... frantic whispers"; rhythmic prose modulates from warping shelves to settling breath; stable first-person with surreal compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (e.g., "stretched and bent, their rigid lines becoming fluid"); no loops or artifacts dull closure image of swan in palm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Origami-burrow to obsidian silence synthesizes surreal history-escape freshly; risk of lyric non-space pays off in charged poise without gimmickry.</comment>
