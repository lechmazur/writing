<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in ascent battle against instinct to curl, earning final endurance where panic yields to carried silence; doll's shift from relic to pilgrim embodies reconfiguration with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silence density breaks from gilded hush to ozone crispness, landing RR closure in final doll placement and breath-stretch image with undeniable perspective cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Trellis lattice constrains boot-purchase and grips during ascent, charging final internalized horizon; mist's emotional weight mirrors expanding silence particular to Elian's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of silence-collection tightens via agency-driven ascent endurance, foreclosing curl-instinct with muscle-spirit cost; descent internalization reweights phobia under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Doll's meaning-shift from confinement fragment to pilgrim reconfigures exposure thesis non-literally, resonating prior father-son dynamic without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature of silence "flavors" (ozone/nascent starlight) biases noticing consistently; rhythmic prose modulates inversion's lightness without distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in ascent; minor metaphor density ("tendril unfurling") coherent but slightly thickens peak without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gravity inversion synthesizes claustrophobia and infinite-safety in fresh silence-collection arc; trellis ascent transforms openness phobia organically.</comment>
