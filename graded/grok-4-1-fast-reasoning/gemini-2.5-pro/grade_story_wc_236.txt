<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied emotions like hand tremor align with motives, revealing contradictory peace amid loss; final endurance earned via prior object readings, with micro-choices under pressure showing value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shop drips to screw's rhythms; closure CR in "extraordinary weight of what remained" reconfigures loss with conceptual cost legible in final breath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog-to-sun evolution mirrors internal shift, constraining tactile reading; clepsydra and screw as micro-settings charge climax and image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (humanize screw) signaled early, deepens via her agency in fingertip translation; cost felt in man's tears and her reweighted void.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Screw's "tension... release" reweights mechanics-to-music premise organically; final image answers loss-as-void without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with sensory-occluded signature ("read the air itself"); diction modulates calmly to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density in "liquid heartbeats" and varied rhythm propel without loops or muddle; clean under ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of anosmia-forged psychometry transforms mundane screw into birth conduit; quiet CR risks bold emotional specificity.</comment>
