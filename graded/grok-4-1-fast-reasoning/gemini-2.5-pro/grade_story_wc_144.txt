<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "decode feedback into direction" roots her calm competence, embodied in fingertip readings of basins; micro-choices like bracing the strut reveal values under time pressure. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously slightly tempers from 9+, but endurance earns closure cost. Harbormaster applies brief pressure without diluting her drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vibration patterns build from dissonance to "flawless, concentric circles," tightening via horn blasts to Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "time was thinning" and final basin stillness reconfiguring her success. Single scene anchors orientation early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist-coated depot and basins constrain choices—fog demands drone, water translates light for blind diagnosis—and charge final image of still water. Sensory hierarchy tactile/auditory reflects Elara's bias; details evolve with repair. Micro-setting (basins) indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (timely repair) signaled early, escalates via "insistent horn blast" forcing unhurried precision; agency in tactile patching narrows options with felt time cost. Under Accumulative lens, density reweights to harmonious hum; cost unmistakable in thunderous final blast.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of decoding chaos emerges organically from dissonance to "perfect note," reweighted in final listening image without moralizing. Subtext in blindness-as-sight invites ambiguity; resonance from particulars like ripples, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with tactile perceptual signature ("fingertips on the cool, wet rims"); rhythmic prose modulates from thrum to pure tone under pressure. Minimal dialogue natural; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer action, vibration, urgency without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies from "shaky, tethered hover" to "single, perfect note." Figuratives purposeful (e.g., "jewel waiting for its fire"), no muddle in peak repair.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind artisan decoding via water refraction transforms repair trope; risk in magnetic calm amid horns heightens stakes. Inevitable hindsight from vibrations to stillness; no derivatives.</comment>
