<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between psychic noise and silenced creativity acts vividly in scene; final sketching renunciation of instrument earned by tracing causality, with cost of long seclusion felt in bones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from routine etching to meteor's "impossible brightness," landing CR closure as Elara pushes instrument aside, reweighting noise with cosmic cost legible in final harmony.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora "draped the stone in ghostly fire" and brass instrument constrain choices, charging final sketching on "clean, smooth stone"; sensory hierarchy (hum over visual) mirrors POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free creativity from noise) deepens via meteor insight under Accumulative lens, narrowing to transformed perception; cost unmistakable as "crushing weight... transformed" forecloses old torment without erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of stardust lament emerges implicitly from particulars like "grinding friction of unspoken resentments," final image reweights premise as "verses of her new and wondrous song" without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("silent hum of anxiety," "brittle fear") biases noticing toward psychic/cosmic; stable close-third POV modulates rhythm with intensity, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies propulsively ("fingers... turned the fine-toothed gears"); high density in meteor beat avoids loops, though minor overwriting in "shadowed rapture" nears purple without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychic affliction as "cries of celestial matter trapped in flesh" transforms trope organically; risk in lyric CR heightens cosmic stakes inevitably.</comment>
