<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular in tapping obsession; contradictory impulses in routine failure vs desperate reconstruction peak at symbol insight, earning final purpose shift with felt solitude cost. Minor early reflective summary anchored but borders BRR limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds through rhythmic trials to alarm-triggered pattern break and CR closure via vision's brief bloom fading to desolation, reweighting premise with undeniable transience cost pinpointed in "The vision held for only a minute before fading."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Station console and viewport constrain choices (tapping site, revelation frame); bleached reef evolves to vibrant memory via resonance, charging final image while mirroring internal shift from ghost to touched eternity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Lena's mystery) tightens accumulatively via failed sequences to symbol-deepening reversal, forcing agency in final tap; cost legible in repeated defeats and vision's fade, though minor abstractness in early stake signal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resonant memory emerges organically from tapping particulars, culminating in non-literal CR: "he had not been trying to find a path to a place... summon the place itself," reweighting disappearance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with oceanic/rhythmic perceptual signature; syntax modulates from drifting cadence to thrum-vibrant intensity at climax, heightening pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in climax taps/vision; minor overwriting in "sun bled... days bled" simile string touches non-closure but risks template feel; closure lines crisp, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eco-grief, rhythmic summoning, and periodic eternity transforms lost-love trope; risk in "harmonize with ocean's memory" pays off inevitably at viewport CR without gimmick.</comment>
