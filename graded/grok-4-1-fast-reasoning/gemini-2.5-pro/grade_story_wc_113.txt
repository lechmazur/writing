<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in obsession intensifies convincingly to the dipping action; interiority embodied in "heart hammering" and micro-choice reveals character under pressure, though archetypal ghost-seeker slightly tempers peak nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to on-page RR closure ("chill dissipated... conversation reached its end"); legible cost in ruined program transforming to music, orientation anchored early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Flooded hall and water constrain pivotal choice (dipping program), lanterns charge atmosphere; sensory details (damp velvet, glassy surface) mirror internal shift and evolve causally, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel code) tightens via agency-driven insight to disrupt; water action forecloses passive study with felt cost (artifact ruined), lens escalation via deepening density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of voiceless past finding expression emerges organically from water-reveal and silence-to-song arc; final image ("hush... gave way to... symphony") offers resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with musician's perceptual signature (unstruck chords, wraiths); rhythmic prose modulates tension, diction biased toward sonic decay, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in peak ("frantic, beautiful, and heartbreaking melody unspooled... unshed tear") risks figurative muddle without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of water damage as musical code transforms ghost trope; flooded opera premise feels inevitable, risk in poetic conceit heightens stakes organically.</comment>
