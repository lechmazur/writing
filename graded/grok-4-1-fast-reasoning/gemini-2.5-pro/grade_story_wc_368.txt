<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>New heart's embodied rhythm compels shift from pigments to people, rooting motivation in concrete micro-choices like sun tracking; final realization earned via accumulated perception without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from curiosity to sun trails to dialogue, landing CR closure in "they are the prisms through which the stories, and the light, must pass"; conceptual cost of reconfigured worldview legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sun trails and morpho wing as micro-settings constrain observation and charge final image; tea house's eastern window and chalk arcs filter through dyer's bias, evolving with light's hesitation around her.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stake to decode her story-magnetism deepens accumulatively via bent light arcs, forcing approach; protagonist agency in tracking narrows options, with cost felt in heart's anticipatory beat resolved quietly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism revelation reweights light/stories premise non-literally, emerging from wing study and sun experiments; woman's "he saw the world that way too" ties donor heart to theme without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dyer's perceptual signature—hues to refractions—stable in first-person; dialogue sparse, subtextual in recognition smile; rhythmic modulation peaks in "quietly explosive knowledge."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varying rhythm propels to closure; coherent light/refraction metaphors avoid muddle, no loops or scaffolds; sun trail arcs exemplify propulsion without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Donor heart transferring prism-perception ingeniously fuses dye craft, optics, and stories; sun trails transform passive curiosity into fresh tactic, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
