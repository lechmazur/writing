<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in "tremor of resistance... He pushed past the fear," earning surrender and transformation with embodied cost of human erasure. Interiority particular via scent-tied memories; steady hands reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds to RR closure in "bond snapped... shared existence," with legible cost in "iridescent plumage that drank the moonlight." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard's moonlight and moss constrain ritual kneeling/grinding; animals' gaze charges witness to final "eternal, steady glow." Sensory specifics (ozone, burnt sugar) filter through POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforge bond) tightens via fear tremor under Accumulative lens, forcing surrender that forecloses human form with on-page cost in changed hands. Agency in persistent grinding narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of bonds reforged emerges implicitly from fortune, scales, and scent; final "cosmic intimacy made manifest" reweights loss into charged presence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with scent-biased perceptual signature ("impossible smell of Lyra’s presence"); rhythmic modulation accelerates to climax cry, compression purposeful in peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated action/metaphor (e.g., "scent... weaving through moonbeams"); minor figurative density in opening slips slightly but pattern pays off without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scent-conjuring and fortune-cookie prophecy synthesize fresh alchemy of grief/transformation; risk of lyric metamorphosis heightens stakes organically to inevitable bond-reforge.</comment>
