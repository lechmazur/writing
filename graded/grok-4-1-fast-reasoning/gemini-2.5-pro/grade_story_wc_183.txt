<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in memory overlays (carousel horse: her glamour vs. his strength), compelling the final renunciation with embodied cost in snapping-back memories. Interiority particular and embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: swatch uses build density to CR closure where final 'Ocean’s Heart' realization reweights premise with conceptual cost in the void-echoing aftermath. Orientation anchored immediately; no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fog's salt/rust taste and corroded gate constrain progression while charging final bridge image overlooking endless grey. Sensory details selective and POV-biased, mirroring internal dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture brother via Garden) tightens accumulatively as timeframe accelerates memories into watercolor bleed, forcing endurance with legible cost in brittle post-climax focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of muted swatches and fog reconfigures trapped freedom into keeper-of-potential stasis, emerging organically from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (memories as narrative threads/weaving) modulates rhythmically; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels through pressure; metaphors cohere (watercolor memories bleeding) without muddle, even in peak console beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Chimera twin premise and swatch-memory mechanics synthesize boldly into inevitable CR; risk-taking in color-as-narrative transforms ghost story tropes organically.</comment>
