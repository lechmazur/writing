<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's steadily curious nature drives feverish building and testing with embodied awe ("a laugh of irreverent awe bubbling"); final yell "Grip!" reveals hierarchy of values, earning closure change with isolation cost legible in "couldn't tell a soul."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: observation of glyph ("finally understood it") therefore builds wing therefore tests with fall-to-grip DC; orientation anchored instantly (workshop on acid sea); closure cost in acid risk undeniable at "fuming acid sea rushed up."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Acid sea pressures launch and charges final suspension ("churning like a monstrous stomach"); workshop's corroded platform and arrow-tip kaleidoscope constrain observation and invention, mirroring internal yearning through selective, POV-filtered detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (implement algorithm) tightens via glyph realization narrowing to "instinct, grease, and faith," forcing test; agency in actuator pull yields grip reversal with visceral cost ("falling," then "holding"); coherent causal escalation to Charged Poise laugh.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of solitary cosmic yearning emerges via glyph-to-wing arc, reweighted in unheard "bell" peal laugh; final image resonates non-literally (gripping "a fold in the air") without moralizing, embracing lonely innovation's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (patterns "sang with faint energy"); voice rhythmic and irreverent ("beautiful disaster," "sacrilegious joy"); sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven ("Grip!") advances climax without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("shimmering patterns bloomed and collapsed"); no loops/artifacts; rhythm accelerates to quiet climax ("world went quiet"), charging closure image without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of yearning algorithm and non-Euclidean grip transforms inventor trope; risk in impossible wing heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight from arrow-tip seed to paradoxical flight.</comment>
