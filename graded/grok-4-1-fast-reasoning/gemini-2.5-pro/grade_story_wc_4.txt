<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to transmute pain is clear and consistent, shown through gentle actions and micro-choices in arranging photos. Perceptively calm demeanor enables the work but lacks shown internal contradiction or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final completion feels earned with felt closure cost, but no pivotal flaws complicate peak choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: photo fragments build density to spiral CR closure, with vines as persistent constraint reweighting time toward completion. Orientation anchored early in lavender field and factory ruins. Final image of packed case delivers Charged Poise with legible cost of fulfilled transience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (lavender scent as balm, vines climbing rust) filter through Elias's priorities and mirror healing arc without overt symbolism. Vines and field constrain time and charge final spiral image. Spatial choreography of plank, photos, and case tracks cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transmuting pain signaled early; accumulative density tightens via seasonal returns to final photo placement, narrowing to release. Agency in lingering and aligning arcs forecloses incomplete mosaic with cost of leaving it packed. No reversal needed; pressure coheres texturally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Collective healing emerges organically from photo arcs shifting pain to recovery, culminating in spiral image as resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in light/shadow language invites reflection via ambiguity of unseen town impact. No moralizing; complexity in quiet endurance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices arcs and contours others miss. Prose texture modulates rhythmically from calm description to charged final image. No head-hopping; compression of seasons taught early and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; sentences advance image and process without loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in photo descriptions risks slight overwrites but integrates without muddling closure. Clean grammar, strong verbs propel to final packing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh premise of photo mosaic as puzzle archivism transforms factory loss trope into ingenious healing ritual. Vines-as-time and arc alignments feel inevitable synthesis; earnest whimsy risks boldly without gimmick.</comment>
