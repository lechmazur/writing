<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Puppet head as concrete emotional anchor grounds interiority and contradictory impulses of arrogance/awe, earning final essence-pouring with embodied cost in slumped exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds from setup through density increase in weaving to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "last of his energy, his very essence, poured into the pattern" reconfiguring peace across time.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal pane and puppet constrain choices (placement at base) and charge final image (thumb on smile amid dissolving motes); sensory thrum "between atoms" narrows to tactile coolness under climax pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of granting peace tightens via thrum onset and fractal weaving agency, culminating in essence cost that unmistakably forecloses survival in final slump against crystal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unknown benediction emerges organically from lullaby fractal rippling backward; final puppet hold reweights prior lifetimes with resonant non-literal peace, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature of hush/ripples/fractals; rhythmic modulation peaks in "filigrees of soft, golden light pulsed" without head-hopping or withhold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density in every line (e.g., "nested patterns... infinitely complex tapestry"); varied rhythm propels to serene closure image without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms doomsday trope via lullaby-weaving surgery on causality; fresh synthesis of puppet relic and crystal pane feels inevitable in hindsight, risking lyric closure payoff.</comment>
