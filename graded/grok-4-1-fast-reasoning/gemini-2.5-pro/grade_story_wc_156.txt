<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's methodical playfulness drives micro-choices like the systematic survey and sequenced flicks, earning the final worldview shift from certainty to curiosity with embodied conflict in initial panic yielding to exhilaration. Internal traits constrain actions without labels. Apprentice adds minimal pressure but doesn't dilute; single-POV interiority specific and contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: awakenings build density via patterned shifts, taught early with first flick dissolving the garden. Closure as Charged Poise/CR in scaffold return and nickel mirror reconfigures existence layers with conceptual cost of traded certainty, legible in "smile of a man who had traded a single world for multitudes."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garden's crystalline structures constrain choices (angle off blue spire yields geometry), evolving sensory details (humming turf to bioluminescent pulses, rain smell) mirror internal shifts. Nickel as micro-setting charges final image, reflecting eye. POV-filtered hierarchy sharpens under urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solve layers vs. embrace) tightens accumulatively: flick experiments narrow options from escape to orchestration, culminating in self-converging tones with felt cost of foreclosed return. Final choice crystallizes stance with agency and trade-off legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of certainty-for-curiosity emerges organically via nickel evolutions and awakenings; final "something that rings" reweights mural as finite canvas against echo-multitudes without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in cataloging ("shift in harmony from minor to major"); rhythmic prose modulates from poised brush to cascading tones. Minimal dialogue natural, subtext in apprentice's pull-back. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: vivid specifics like "crystalline structures like glass ferns" integrate action without loops or scaffolds. Varied rhythm breathes with intensity; metaphors coherent (world "bewitch itself"). No artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hobo nickel's evolving carvings synthesize sound-garden premise into fresh nested realities; transforms dream-trope via physics-made-tactile, risking bold time-compression that heightens stakes in pause's infinity. Inevitable hindsight from restorer-as-unfolder.</comment>
