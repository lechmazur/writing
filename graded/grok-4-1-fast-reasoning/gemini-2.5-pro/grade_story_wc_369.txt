<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in "quantified sorrow" and tree-witnessing need intensifies compellingly through meter spike and tree's final fall memory. Interiority concrete via steady hand and mesmerized watching, with micro-choices like gentle collection aligning under pressure. Minor lack of contradictory impulses limits to very strong; no deep internal conflict disrupts serene competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as shard analysis builds density to lightning coalescence and archival closure (RR/Charged Poise). On-page cost legible in shard's "jagged edges" smoothing to "serene acceptance," reconfiguring grief. Orientation anchored early in tower/labyrinth; single scene tightens meaningfully at meter spike.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moonlight and storm constrain choices, charging final image where "shaft of pure moonlight" heals shard. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: dust motes as "colleagues," tink's precision amid thunder. Micro-setting (sextant, slate) guides deconstruction; weather evolves causally, mirroring internal process.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shard origin via tree sorrow) signaled early, tightens texturally at meter spike and lightning, narrowing to acceptance. Agency in patient process forecloses oblivion path with felt cost in tree's "dizzying fall." Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, though subtle for 8.8+ entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow's home emerges organically from tree visions to archival mosaic, final image reweighting "mundane miracle" without moral. Resonance from particulars like "crystallized despair" to pearlescent glow. Invites reflection on trees as "silent archivists" via earned insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: "dust motes dancing... only real colleagues." Prose texture distinct in syntax/rhythm, modulating from quiet hum to crescendo spike. No head-hopping; diction reflects craft-specific lexicon like "emotional resonance."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "tink" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful (phantasmagoria blooms), no muddle in peak lightning beat. Propulsion peaks crisply at "jagged edges... serene acceptance."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy craft ("quantified sorrow" via sextant) transforms tree grief trope into inevitable archival poise. Risky quiet fantasy risks stasis but heightens via textual density. Non-obvious tree-archivist angle feels organic, charging closure hindsight.</comment>
