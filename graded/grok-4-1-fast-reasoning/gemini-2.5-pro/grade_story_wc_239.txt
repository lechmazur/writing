<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong consistent motivation rooted in unification, intensifying through spiral walk to earned dissolution of self; interiority concrete in warped dictionary and thinning boundary, but minor abstraction in epiphanies lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak center moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase via layered realizations and path convergence to on-page CR closure; book drop and self-unraveling at center deliver legible conceptual cost of individuality in final lines, with persistent path constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Polished obsidian, curving shelves, and plenum hush vividly constrain spiral path and charge dais finale; sensory hush mirrors internal unification, filtering through Witness's archivist bias without tourist catalog; recurring dictionary tethers choices to final fall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unraveling illusions deepens accumulatively via dictionary pause and center arrival, narrowing to renunciation with cost of self-dissolution; path pressure forces endurance to unify, legible in thinning boundary before book drop.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of conflictless cosmic resolution emerges organically from spiral path mimicking arbitration, reweighted in final unification image without moralizing; dictionary reprise shifts from key to fading tether, offering resonant non-literal answer to illusion premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in silence-as-plenum and warped words; rhythmic prose modulates from wandering texture to compressed finale, prose-as-character reflecting dissolving mind without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via integrated images like "gravitational dance"; no loops or scaffolds, purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle in peak center beat, though minor elevated diction risks slight register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dictionary as cosmic key and spiral arbitration transforms end-of-history trope into inevitable unification; risk-taking in lyric CR heightens stakes via path constraint, feeling organic and non-derivative.</comment>
