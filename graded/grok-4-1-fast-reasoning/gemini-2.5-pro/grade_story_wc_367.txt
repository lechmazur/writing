<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in grand purpose drives micro-choices like lever adjustments; embodied emotions via manic laughter escalating to trembling exhaustion feel particular. Final realization of reciprocal shaping earns a subtle endurance with felt cost in quiet chuckle. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses limits from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from beam activation to storm integration; clear orientation in opening lines. Conceptual Repricing closure lands cleanly in final realization ("the dawn was beginning to shape him too") with conceptual cost of lost unilateral control. No causality breaks or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystalline apparatus and glass wick constrain choices (levers/dials alter facets); sensory details like emerald beam "stabbing" and tower shudder filter through Kaelan's shadowed glee. Final dawn's "unfamiliar quality" charges closure image, mirroring unintended prophecy. Vivid, purposeful integration elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape dawn via storm) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via wick's white-hot strain and tower resonance, narrowing to fulfillment with exhaustion cost. Agency in hands-on adjustments drives tightening; unintended prophetic consequence adds conceptual price legible in dawn's shape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of creation via destruction emerges organically from glyphs as "celestial graffiti" misinterpreted as prophecy, reweighted in mutual shaping. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity in Kaelan's unawareness avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (cosmic shadows, manic lens on chaos); rhythmic modulation peaks in "laughter became a gale, competing with the ethereal shriek." Lyrical compression taught early pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm accelerates from setup to climax shudder; no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("symphony of chaos," "contained nova") borders overwriting in peak but remains legible and voice-motivated, not harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse optics steering cosmic storms via internal reflection transforms tropes into accidental prophecy. Risky shadowed elation tone heightens stakes organically; core premise feels inevitable in hindsight via glyph patterns.</comment>
