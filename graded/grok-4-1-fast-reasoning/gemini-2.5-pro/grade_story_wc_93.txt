<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in ignoring eels' distress to use Elara's forbidden star dust, earning the final slump as visible cost; interiority particular via mathematical obsession under curse pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via vision → rock placement → star dust pour → wave split DC; orientation anchored in first paragraph's boots/sea/aurora; closure cost legible in "Kael slumped to his knees."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bluff constrains via magnetic boots groaning under surge, aurora channels energy into keystone; selective sensory hierarchy (sliding sea, warped air) filters through precog POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save patterns/nexus from certain vision) tightens via last-resort dust pour as wave crests, agency forecloses powerless path with bodily cost; causal escalation narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of bending curse via patterns emerges implicitly from rock circuit harnessing aurora; final image reweights aurora from "borrowed" to "tool," resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (fractals, sigils, cosmic math); rhythmic prose modulates from fluid economy to hum/vibration under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates figuration (e.g., "thimbleful of night") into action without muddle; varied syntax propels to closure, no loops or scaffolds dulling wave-split peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh frictionless world synthesizes precog curse, math rocks, and star-dust anchor into inevitable climax; risk-taking in sci-fant hybrid heightens cosmic stakes organically.</comment>
