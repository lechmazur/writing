<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to spin prophecy into possibility roots deeply in traits like monastic painstakingness, compelling the final renunciation; contradictory impulses between duty and belief act in scene via cataloging versus ignoring the hourglass. Interiority concrete via button histories revealing character under unraveling pressure. Final choice earned by prior causality with visible cost of forsaking duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: button density and whisper clarification build to pattern break and CR closure where prophecy reconfigures from doom to crossroads, cost legible in on-page refusal to turn hourglass and step into unknown. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph. Single scene coherent, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amber warehouse's grimy resin windows, thick air, and hourglass constrain choices via fading time, charging final image of walking past it to doors; selective sensory details (sand trickle, whisper flood) filtered through Kaelen's priorities mirror internal unraveling. Micro-setting of buttons table guides cataloging action purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel prophecy before sand runs out) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via button placements tightening whispers into coherent stories, narrowing options to crossroads realization; agency in final renunciation forecloses duty path with felt cost of uncertain dawn. One decisive deepening suffices, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of prophecy as choice tapestry emerges organically from button histories and jar synthesis, culminating in resonant CR where final voice reweights premise without moralizing; lingering ambiguity of new clause invites reflection via particulars like fire-warden's toggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in button-specific observations and whisper perceptions; prose texture distinct in rhythmic, incantatory phrasing ("tiny, discarded decision") modulating with intensity, no head-hopping or elision issues. Voice embodies Kaelen's quiet inspiration without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., buttons log history while unscrambling voices); rhythm varies naturally, syntax propels from quiet cataloging to charged silence, no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—figurative language purposeful and sparse in peak beats. Zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hourglass prophecy with button cataloging as unraveling method transforms tropes into inevitable reconfiguration; risk in quiet, accumulative closure heightens stakes via irreplaceable particulars like scarred toggle, feeling organic and bold without gimmickry.</comment>
