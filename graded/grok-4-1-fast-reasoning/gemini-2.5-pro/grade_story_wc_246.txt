<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in simultaneous impulses to edit vs. face consequences, embodied in hunched body and frantic dance; final renunciation earned via cascade failures. "Confidently uncertain" borders diagnostic label-speak but shown through posture without derailing. Flawless pivotal shift from editor to commentator with felt cost in self-erasure fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from signal chirp through failed edits to CR closure in footnote transmission, reweighting history-editing premise with conceptual cost of unchangeable self. Orientation anchored by ~50 words in station anomaly. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in "obliterate the man who had learned... discard the chaff and the grain together."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Anomaly and pen as micro-settings constrain choices and charge final image: warping enables temporal crease, pen reweights from "useless monument" to "testament." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (signal hums, skin pressure). Environment mirrors internal unbending in "soothing embrace."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix Proxima error) tightens via cascade disasters narrowing options, forcing agency in renunciation; escalation accumulates texturally with each edit's new blight/flare. Cost unmistakable in foreclosed path and "immense pressure" embodiment. Protagonist drives under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of understanding over undoing emerges organically from pen's reprise and signal quieting; final image non-literally answers "fix or thresh?" via eulogy transmission. Pen shifts from failure symbol to harvest emblem without moralizing. Resonance reweights prior cascades with ambiguity of unchangeable growth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: interpreter's warped noticing (signal waveforms, spacetime pressure). Rhythmic control modulates from frantic to stillness, prose as mind in "dance... contingent relationships." No head-hopping; elision of backstory anchors present choices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density propels via varied syntax mirroring tension release (short frantic sentences to flowing finale). "Thresh meaning... harvest" metaphors cohere without muddle. Closure image crisp: pen catching light as testament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal anomaly folding time for history-editing with cascade consequences transforms trope; risk in solo internal arc heightens stakes via unfixable universe. Pen's meteoritic nib and footnote tactic feel inevitable. Bold CR ending avoids tidy undo.</comment>
