<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the tug-of-war with the cloth, embodying "master of the material world but a novice in the geography of his own heart"; final placement of the cloth as "evidence" earns change with emotional cost. Minor label-speak in "confidently uncertain" doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as object-handling density builds to Resonant Reconfiguration; closure lands cleanly in folding/placing cloth with felt cost of integrating regret. Orientation anchored early in trailer/workbench; single scene fits defaults perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring objects (shoebox, cloth, recorder) constrain choices and charge final image; quarry pit evolves from "wound" to "echo valley" mirroring internal shift via dawn light. Sensory hierarchy (hum, scraping knuckles, ozone memory) filters through appraiser's eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (purpose after loss) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative density in cloth-wresting triggering memory flood, narrowing to endurance of past with cost in crumbling "fortress of facts." Agency in physical struggle forces reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of value in remnants emerges organically from cloth as "anchor to the shipwreck" reweighted to "evidence"; final image offers resonant answer without moralizing, lingering on complexity of applause's aftermath.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in appraiser's precise details ("mid-90s Marshall, salt-and-pepper basketweave"); rhythmic control modulates from detached facts to charged memory without distance slips. POV stable and biased toward tactile facts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances via integrated action/image; varied rhythm peaks in "final, ripping sound" without loops or artifacts. Figuratives like "echo valley" purposeful, charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie/appraiser parallels (ear for feedback, eye for fakes) transforms failure trope; risk in lyric reflection heightens quiet closure's inevitability without gimmickry.</comment>
