<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—stoic exterior masking flinching sensitivity—act in scene via failed experiments; final surrender earned by mounting failures with cost of crozier's destruction. Interiority concrete and particular, avoiding labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: successive approximations build density to pattern break ("penny drops") and Charged Poise closure in flower's emergence, with legible cost of total dissolution. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ember nexus and dying ley lines constrain choices (embers heat attempts, fading mirror failures) and charge final image (flower over ashes). Sensory details selective via alchemical POV, purposeful without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape mediocrity via vivification) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through 72 failures narrowing to final fragment; surrender agency forecloses command path with crozier's dissolution cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of release via unmaking emerges organically from particulars; final frozen bloom offers resonant reconfiguration of "creative destruction," reweighting prior failures without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (alchemical sensitivity to essences); rhythmic control heightens pressure in dissolution beat, diction biased and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion; varied rhythm breathes with scene, no loops. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("mask of stoic resignation") but purposeful, not muddling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy as surrender-born magic; crozier-to-bloom transformation inevitable from particulars, bold risk in quiet closure heightens thematic stakes.</comment>
