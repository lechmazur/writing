<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via translator analogies and embodied sorrow (dirt under nails); motivation intensifies from haunted to illuminated via earned waveform realization; final endurance of distance with anticipation shows contradictory impulses acting in ritual planting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from observation to seed-planting and sprout CR; orientation anchored in first paragraph (arbor, garden, Kael's cycles); closure costs distance persisting as "space between two connected points."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor's hum and field lines constrain planting site at central node and charge final pulsing sprout; sensory details (thrum like heartbeat, silver vines) filtered through translator's perceptual bias; micro-setting of soil bed evolves with hum shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode transition) signaled early and deepens via analogy to waveform, forcing planting agency; Accumulative escalation in ritual waiting and sprout tightens to Charged Poise; cost legible in softened torment yielding anticipation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of translation/information persistence emerges organically from particulars like cuneiform and waveform analogy; final luminescent sprout reweights absence as encoded presence without moralizing; resonance in "not erased; encoded differently."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of analogical patterns (life as waveform); rhythmic control modulates from sorrowful thrum to anticipatory semitone climb; diction purposeful and biased toward syntax/physics metaphors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "hands...moved with a kindly methodical grace as she tended"); varied rhythm supports propulsion, no loops or muddled metaphors; closure image of pulsing filament clean and propulsive.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform translation and quantum waveform grief in sci-fi arbor; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative build to CR sprout pays off stakes; waveform analogy transforms trope of loss into inevitable physics of connection.</comment>
