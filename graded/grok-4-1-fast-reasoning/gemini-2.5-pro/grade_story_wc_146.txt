<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's infinite patience embodied in hours of deliberate footfalls compels the circuit's completion, earning the revival's first layer; minimal internal conflict limits contradictory impulses to mere competence without deeper struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as footsteps layer echoes into nascent heartbeats; Charged Poise closure lands cleanly with the final hum anchoring potential, cost felt in ongoing daily returns ("He would be back tomorrow").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobblestones constrain the core method, channeling rhythms into awakening; baker's outline shimmers as setting mirrors internal tuning, charging the archway bookend.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to restore the town's note tightens via growing echoes that narrow silence to promise; protagonist agency in rhythmic walking drives density increase, but single deepening lacks a sharper trade-off beyond patience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of balance as maintained rhythm emerges implicitly from footsteps summoning life; final anchor image reweights dissonance with conceptual cost of perpetual upkeep, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature fixates on sonic texture ("hum that vibrated through the soles"); rhythmic prose modulates with patient intensity, no head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in layered percussion; varied rhythm passes ear test, minor poetic elevation consistent without muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic revival via footsteps transforms ghost town trope organically; risk in abstract tuning premise heightens stakes through lived particularity, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
