<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through spatial gift perceiving "lattice of forces" and phantom hand, with contradictory grief (hold vs. release) driving micro-choice of resonator aim; final renunciation earned with embodied exhaustion costing the "quiet wildfire." Blind spots in obsession balance competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of distortions and field pressure builds to button-click RR (Charged Poise in permeable opening); closure cost legible in "profound exhaustion" and solidified boundary, with orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent Fae Caps constrain choice by generating "dimensional friction" field, charging final image as "blue-green haze dissolving"; sensory hierarchy (ozone, damp earth) reflects POV urgency, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (build better door) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative density to agency in "thumb depressed... click," foreclosing reunion with felt cost in receding smile and chest wildfire extinguished.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of "physics of letting go" emerges organically from permeable act and final finch echo reweighting premise (wall to door); resonant non-literal closure avoids moralizing, with ambiguity in her "smile of release."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third with perceptual signature ("symphony of pressures and vacuums"); rhythmic control modulates to stillness at "holding his breath," no head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies (short click sentence amid longer builds), purposeful figures like "quiet wildfire" cohere without muddle in climax beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mycelial fields and salvaged laser button transforms ghost trope into dimensional release; risk in quiet climax heightens emotional stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
