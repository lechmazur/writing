<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation to illuminate assumptions intensifies through layered probing, earning Elara's return with felt exhaustion; micro-choices like pedal taps reveal values under pressure. Limited contradictory impulses keep it from 9+; competence dominates over genuine struggle in climax questions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound layers densify, glitch breaks pattern, collapsing to CR closure where entity's philosophy fractures with conceptual cost in palette's fall. One tightening via stuttering loop suffices; orientation anchored early in cube room.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Loop pedal and palette constrain choices (taps layer sound, gesture deploys gray) and charge final image (clatter reveals "just a color"). Sensory hierarchy (bone-felt hum, dry rustle) reflects urgency; silence as texture guides exorcism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exorcise before completion) signaled early, escalates via deepening questions narrowing entity's logic to stammer, forcing agency in switch collapse with visible cost (shudder, gasp). Accumulative cadence shift reweights monochrome to infinite complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of perspective refuting limitation emerges via unraveling gray/stillness, final image repricing palette non-literally without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like looped "truth" echoing lie; invites ambiguity in "arguments with ourselves."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (silence-carved air, sonic textures); voice modulates from hum to whisper, diction purposeful. Dialogue subtextual ("synonym for limitation"), goal-driven; rhythm distinct without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short stutters mirror glitch); no loops, metaphors coherent (sound as "texture within" quiet). Minor overwriting in openings integrated, propels to vacuum collapse without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of loop pedal/rhetoric exorcism transforms possession trope; risk in sonic philosophy unraveling heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from "manufactured imperfection" to retreat; no derivative echoes.</comment>
