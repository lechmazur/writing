<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in "quiet obsession that hummed beneath her ribs" intensifies to compel climax choice; embodied ache as "water-smoothed wood" and final "driftwood nostalgia" joined by harmony earn change with felt emotional cost. Minimal shown contradictory impulses during key action slightly limits peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via prophecy fragments to causal climax; on-page Decisive Change at "gear... slid into the crescent lock... Orrery shuddered" with legible cost in persistent ache reconfigured by fulfillment. Orientation anchors early ("frozen library above the clouds"); lens holds cleanly to charged closure image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains pivotal choice—"to look at [Orrery] directly was to be blinded"—forcing shadow tactic; micro-setting of vial and gears charges final golden light shift. Sensory details (frost crackling, meshing sigh) integrate purposefully through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair Orrery) signaled early, tightens via revelation—"perfect, circular shadow... Revealed... a keyhole"—driven by agency under Accumulative lens; cost felt in averted gaze trade-off and ache's endurance. One decisive deepening suffices and coheres pressure to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of shadowed repair emerges organically from prophecy scraps to Orrery pulse; final image ("mirrors... dissolving into one... warm and golden") offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Particulars like crescent lock avoid platitudes, lingering ambiguity in nostalgia's persistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature biases to mechanisms ("toothed disc... meshing metal") and shadows; rhythmic prose modulates from hushed buildup to "low groan... rhythmic pulse." Stable third-limited POV with no leakage or withholding; elisions taught via prophecy pay off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but dense figuratives ("drink the light... shed skin") in climax beat verge on overwriting without full pattern restraint (-0.4). No loops or scaffolds; clean syntax supports propulsion to "sound of healing."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eclipse locksmith crafting shadow-void key transforms prophecy tropes; "liquid shadow" vial and crescent lock feel inevitable from established lineage. Bold fantasy risks heighten stakes without gimmickry, charging closure organically.</comment>
