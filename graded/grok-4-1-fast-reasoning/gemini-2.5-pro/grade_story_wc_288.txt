<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied memories like "tasting salt on a primeval wind" and contradictory fear/coexistence impulses; earned change from cage to reservoir via desperation. Minor label-speak in "brittle awakenings" slightly abstracts peak strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with memory density building to floor immersion then reconfiguration; on-page CR closure in "He was a reservoir" reweights isolation with felt cost of slammed cage held by hum. Orientation anchored early in library/home.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atomically reflective floor constrains climax by mirroring menagerie, charging final image; tidal library's mist/starlight/sea of clouds filters POV selectively, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation to independence) signaled early, escalates via awakening density to immersion reversal under lens; agency in stone focus forecloses forgetting with legible cost in hitched breath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preservation over conquest emerges organically from sundial/stones/memories; final image of extinct parade offers resonant CR answer to isolation question, reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (ethereal/memory-tinged noticing); rhythmic prose modulates from quiet tracing to immersive hum, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyricism like "swirling script of a nebula-bound codex"; minor overwriting in stacked figures ("mist and starlight," "sea of forgotten clouds") risks muddle but supports texture without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinct memories in reflective floor via hum ritual transforms isolation trope; risk-taking in lyric fantasy frame feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening closure.</comment>
