<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to "turn questions into destinations" roots actions like decoding needles and fencing shadows; mechanical arm's "grace that belied its construction" embodies competence with struggle. Internal focus on "every moment... a proposition to be tested" shows character-specific perception under puzzle pressure. No strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits 9+; closure choice earned but lacks deeper flaw-cost friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: needle reflections → coded angles → fencing sequence → precise strike as Decisive Change unlocking scroll with timing cost from shortening shadow. Single scene, orientation anchored early via atrium and sundial. Closure cost legible in "exact instant the shadow’s edge touched the final painted marker"; persistent shadow constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sundial as micro-setting constrains every fencing choice, gnomon shadow charges final image; glass atrium light enables needle reflections while brook provides auditory baseline. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: light/shadow prioritized over visuals, whirring arm tactile. Details evolve causally with sun climb; body (mechanical arm) and tool (rapier) navigated lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solve Elara's puzzle for debate advance) signaled early, tightens causally via shadow shortening forcing precise sequence; agency in "needle card dictated" moves forecloses error path with timing cost. Final disengage narrows to seam, reweighting options; pressure coheres under Causal lens to Charged Poise in scroll reveal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of agency vs. predetermination emerges via sundial's half-painted fate conquered by action, scroll's "map" non-literal answer reconfiguring query into journey. Particulars like shadow accusation and coded needles build resonance without statement; final image charges philosophical maze into tangible destination. Complexity in "insult and invitation" avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: philosopher's lens turns physics poetic ("fluid syllogism executed in tempered steel"). Rhythmic control modulates from patient circling to "whirlwind of dignified chaos"; diction precise, syntax reflects mechanical precision. No dialogue; purposeful compression in fencing beats heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., arm's whirring harmonizes blade song); rhythm varies from long contemplative opens to short strike propulsion. Minor figurative density in fencing ("dance of light," "physical meditation") purposeful without muddle or loop; closure chime/image clean. Slight scaffold in opening motivation tell nudges from 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dueling as philosophical proof via needle-coded shadow fencing transforms duel trope organically. Risky conceit (rapier vs. time-puzzle) inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes without gimmick; no derivative echoes, voice commits to steampunk-philosopher vision.</comment>
