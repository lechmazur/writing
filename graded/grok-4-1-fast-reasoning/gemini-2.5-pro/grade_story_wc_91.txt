<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to understand transformation drives micro-choices like the shell detour and bug release, embodied in bare feet sinking and final palm on sand. Interiority concrete via curiosity's pivot, revealing philanthropic traits without stock epiphanies. No strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits to very strong band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup from beach hush to alcove glyphs and bug release culminates in CR closure via mountain's sigh and Kael's felt heartbeat, with cost in empty bottles and dispersal. Single scene, orientation anchored early ("black sand beach at the foot of Iona"). Lens taught by midpoint, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Volcanic specifics (obsidian grains, basaltic circle, tidal pool glyphs) constrain detour path and charge final warm sand image. Sensory hierarchy (hiss, thrum in bones, bioluminescent steam) mirrors internal quest, integrated into action. Evolving environment (intensifying planetary glow) supports textural drive without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of transformation) signaled early, tightens texturally via detour to prophesied alcove and release triggering sigh. Agency in unstopping bottles forecloses simple plan with accidental cost. One deepening sufficient under Accumulative lens, but low overt opposition caps below 9.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of accidental transformation emerges organically from light motifs shifting to verdant plume and final heartbeat realization, reweighting quest without moralizing. Closing image non-literally answers central question, resonant via cosmic-terrestrial interplay. Complexity in unwitting prophecy fulfillment invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature attuned to lights, silences, changes ("texture of transformation"). Rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, diction purposeful (e.g., "philanthropist of moments"). No elision or head-hopping; voice distinguishes serene curiosity under cosmic pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., bug glow illuminating glyphs advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Purposeful figuratives build texture without muddle in peak release/sigh. Minor elevated diction fits voice but risks slight drift in quieter beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireflies-soothing-volcano via accidental prophecy transforms wanderer trope through textural hush and celestial pivot. Risky lyric closure inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes via unwitting fulfillment. No derivative echoes; bold quiet ending charges meaning.</comment>
