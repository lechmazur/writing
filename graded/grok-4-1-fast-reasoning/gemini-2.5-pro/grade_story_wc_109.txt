<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kaelen's obsession drives precise ritual actions like tracing the glyph, earning stasis in the final sated endurance; embodied in calloused finger and inward focus on silences. Minor abstraction in "cartographer’s dream turned metaphysical nightmare" but does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silences densify to ambered hush and absolute night; on-page Conceptual Repricing in closing the booklet with "dying embers" on fingertips makes endless task's cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Storm's "blade sharpening itself" and stone slit's star constrain ritual timing, charging final hush holding him; sensory selectivity (saline silence, wind's howls) mirrors perceptual narrowing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping endless night escalates texturally via deepening silences and star's dissolution, forcing endurance; cost felt in infinite puzzle's piece-by-piece isolation at close.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of eternity via silence emerges organically, resonant in glyph capturing "texture of this specific darkness" without moralizing; final image reweights obsession's quiet sufficiency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature on silence qualities ("heavy and saline") stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in purposeful silence metaphors without muddle or loops; propulsion peaks in "tight spiral represented the vortex of stillness," varying rhythm to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle mapping night via silence transforms cartographic trope; risk in textural accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes through ritual isolation.</comment>
