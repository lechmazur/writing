<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through economical actions to preserve wisdom, with embodied calm (mask cool against cheek) under zeal's pressure; strangely honest trait enables inciting speech but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal consecration. Internal conflict subtle, shown via peripheral awareness rather than raw struggle. Competence dominates without blind-spot mistakes compounding visibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pavilion distortion accumulates to ritual deepening, closing with on-page RR (sphere pulses, seals echo) and legible mental cost ("offering of staggering mental weight"). Single shard sequence coherent, orientation anchored early (pavilion post-prophet). No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (sand shivers, obsidian glows, cool darkness) filters through Kael's priorities, constraining ritual (marker paces spiral) and charging closure (dune seals seamlessly). Desert sea mirrors internal whisperfield calm without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (leviathan rib) guides key choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve fading wisdom) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via distortion catalyst to consecration tightening, narrowing distortion risk with mental cost felt on-page. Agency in peripheral focus forecloses misinterpretation path. Pressure coheres without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of pure truth amid distortion emerges organically from pavilion zeal to sealed clearing, with final image (pavilion hum irrelevant) offering resonant CR reweighting debates. Complexity lingers in fragile echo's isolation without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from preservation question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (peripheral awareness of air, gaze) and rhythmic prose modulating to ritual cadence; diction purposeful (whisperfield calm). No head-hopping; voice biased to Kael's honest serenity. Brief dialogue natural, goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short ritual steps to pulsing climax); metaphors coherent and purposeful (loom of sound, salt in water) without muddle in peak beats. Zero loops, scaffold, or template cadence; propulsion weaves image and action seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of line walker ritual and psychic machine transforms preservation trope into peripheral-awareness mechanic, with risk-taking in lyric fantasy world risking opacity but succeeding via taught pattern. Closure image inevitable from dune access onward; no derivative echoes.</comment>
