<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in sacred duty drives all micro-choices, like sifting chaos for joy memory; interiority concrete via "lucidly watchful" state and narrowing focus. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the infusion beat, but competence balanced by fraying soul's fragility yields credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to sifting, infusion as RR (Charged Poise) with cost in soul's dissolution and aurora's softening. Orientation anchored early ("grotto of crystalline rock adrift... cosmic veils"); closure image of locket reconfigures options legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora as recurring micro-setting constrains choice (source of static) and charges final image ("aurora... gentling into a slow, respectful waltz"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (vibrations felt in consciousness); details integrated via goal-directed sifting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture spark) signaled early, tightens via narrowing focus in chaos ("pouring all of her will"); agency in intuitive method forecloses dissolution path with felt cost (soul gone). Under lens, cadence shift in infusion reweights stake without reversal excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of preserving life's sparks against oblivion emerges via particulars (joy memory in gem); final locket image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting alcove's "preserved beauty." Subtext in ritual honors memory without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("patterns in static where others would perceive only random flux"); rhythmic control modulates (short precise sentences in infusion). Lyrical diction voice-motivated, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "liquid light, a current of warmth and gold" does image+momentum); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful in peak sifting beat without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mortician artistry and cosmic soul-capture; premise transformed via pattern-sifting method and gem memorials. Risky lyric poise heightens eternal preservation stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
