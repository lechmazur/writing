<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between capture and forgetting act in scene, culminating in earned micro-choice of imperfect circle that forecloses possession with embodied cost (dust on fingertips, receding hum).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening to Charged Poise closure; dissolving chalk circle delivers legible conceptual cost, pattern of markers taught early anchors orientation cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Damp basalt slab and fog constrain final choice and charge closure image; recurring driftwood and mist mirror internal erasure through tactile action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture sound signaled early, tightens accumulatively via sigil loss forcing renunciation; agency in circle-drawing forecloses path with visible price on damp stone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of blurring circle offers non-literal resonant answer to possession vs. presence, reweighting echo motif with thematic cost of transience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct sonic-tactile perceptual signature; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure to closure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to peak, coherent metaphors (e.g., "tidal longing") avoid muddle; minor hum-thrum synonym churn purposeful but caps perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Surreal premise of sonic aging synthesized originally through chalk sigil failure, risk-taking in lyric texture heightens stakes to inevitable closure reconfiguration.</comment>
