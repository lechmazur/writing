<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with motivation intensifying through embodied chill of fear/exhilaration; final change from thief of past to custodian of future earned by jar's vibration, foreclosing prior passion with portraits rendered inert.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from floral code to jar's contents; CR closure lands on-page in "portraits...seemed flat" with conceptual cost of shifted worldview reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emerald panes casting "spectral, watery green glow" constrain heist (midnight access via hatch) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy reflects POV's light obsession, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture destiny's hints) signaled early, tightens via reinterpretation forcing pilgrimage over heist; cost legible in "weight both negligible and immense," charging final poise under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of past echoes vs. future whispers emerges organically from portraits-to-jar progression; final image of "universe dream in a bottle" offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting prior pursuits.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with luminous perceptual signature ("honeyed light," "liquid silver threads"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in approach beat, elision of mechanics taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in approach echo silence); no loops or muddle, figurative coherence peaks in "swirling, liquid silver threads" without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis transforms portrait heist into moonbeam pilgrimage; risk of esoteric prize pays off in inevitable-feeling CR, heightening stakes through irreplaceable jar logic.</comment>
