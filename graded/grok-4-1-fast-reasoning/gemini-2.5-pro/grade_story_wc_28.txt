<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's interior contradiction—his own "constant, low thrum" of absorbed pain versus delivering mercy—acts simultaneously during the renaming, earning the closure choice with embodied cost in the "hollow ache."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from tessera placement to renaming climax, landing Charged Poise closure in the man's "clear, calm, and empty" eyes and Kaelen's resolve, with cost legible in his "ghost’s departure" ache; orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mosaic stepping stone as circuit constrains the core choice (tessera pressed into fissure activates hum), charging final fade of light; shattered sky and ash integrate tactilely via "tasting of static," mirroring internal tyranny without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mercy via identity edit) signaled early tightens in "silent battle" behind eyes, driven by Kaelen's agency; cost unmistakable in his post-act "hollow ache," foreclosing unburdened future under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aberrant mercy emerges organically from renaming act to resonant final image of "cold, clean peace" versus Kaelen's thrum, reweighting memory-as-tyrant premise without moralizing; counter-reading lingers in his "sad smile."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (fire echoes as personal thrum); voice texture modulates poetically yet controlled, e.g., "warm coldness" in murmured line, natural sparse dialogue advances without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated action-image (tessera to hum trace); minor overwriting in dense metaphors like "cradle empathy in arms of steel" (repeated phrasing) dulls peak slightly but rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops touch closure.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mosaic-as-circuit premise synthesizes fresh post-fire mercy via renaming, transforming identity tropes; risk in "editor, excising... corrupted text" feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
