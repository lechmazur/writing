<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo's motivation to discover ceiling secrets roots consistently in traits like upward gaze and spectral observation, compelling the pivotal ladder climb; interiority embodied via chill and steady heart under ghost pressure. Micro-choices reveal values with cost in ignoring safe exit. Minor lack of deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously slightly limits 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from routine smudges to ghost's vivid gesture and dust anomaly, tightening to retrieval and ghost fade as Resonant Reconfiguration with legible conceptual cost (tether broken). Orientation anchored early in job/site/POV; single scene causality clear without slips. Closure image of fading ghost reconfigures veil crack with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dust patterns on tiles constrain choice, charging final retrieval; circus office details (clown fissures, popcorn phantom) selectively mirror cracks theme via Leo's observant POV. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under power-cut silence. Environment guides ascent, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover ceiling secret) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ghost gesture and dust disturbance forcing engagement choice with felt chill cost. One deepening reversal at anomaly narrows options; agency in climb yields ghost release but forecloses detachment path. Minor abstractness in initial stake slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cracks in façade emerges organically from clown fissures, dust edges, and spectral veil repair via particulars; final brass catch reweights hidden burdens without moralizing. Subtext in ghost's calm implies incomplete task's toll. Resonance lingers in mended veil image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in upward sweeps and dust scrutiny; diction/rhythm modulates from methodical to charged in silence shift. No head-hopping; voice biases toward liminal observation. Clean free indirect without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence lengths; no loops or scaffolds, vivid verbs propel (e.g., "screech...echoing like a shout"). Minor cliché in "silence crashed" and occasional purple edge ("pure information") in vision beat dull propulsion slightly at climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator tech/ghost-seer in circus decay transforms tropes via dust forensics and mainspring tether; risk in quiet spectral release heightens conceptual stakes. Premise commits to ceiling secrets logic without retreat.</comment>
