<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's luminous skepticism drives consistent motivation and culminates in an earned conceptual shift with humbling cost ("profoundly illuminated, given a new and humbling scale"). Interiority shines through embodied taste and ring-twisting micro-choices; no deep contradictory impulses act simultaneously in pivotal convergence, limiting peak to strong rather than exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds sensory density to closure CR: storms merge into aurora pulse, tastes clear to clean night, reweighting skepticism with legible conceptual cost in final image ("lost coordinates finding their harbor"). Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early, lens holds flawlessly through payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy (taste primacy, lavender/ozone) filters via POV urgency, constraining detection; aurora/body (skin luminescence) charges closure image as active participant ("ribbons tightening, descending"). Lavender bluff nexus guides convergence without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proof of weather-carriers) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via intensifying tastes/carriers to cadence shift (aurora absorption), narrowing to humbling repricing. Protagonist agency observational but embodied (sensing boots/ring); cost felt in realization without overt trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mechanistic proof vs. organic convergence emerges organically via sensory particulars and CR final image ("not about fixing people, but about learning to read a map written in lightning and rain"), reweighting premise without moralizing. Resonance from hypothesis friction yields lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (taste gradients, light/skin bias); rhythmic lyric texture modulates from skeptical precision to awe-charged closure. No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion without loops; figurative layer ("ships into phantom harbor") coherent and pattern-taught, varying rhythm accelerates to closure pulse. Minor density in opener build risks slight overwrite but pays off without muddling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taste-detection sci-fi and emergent biology transforms weather tropes into inevitable CR harbor image; bold lyric risk (taste/compass as dual compass) heightens stakes organically, no hedging.</comment>
