<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to defy conformity roots in consistent chastity trait, intensifying through embodied dance of echoes; contradictory burden/release impulses act in the rite's final knot. Final smile earns renunciation with visible cost of decade's harvest. No safety-hedging flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via thread-unwinding to Charged Poise closure in prism flash and smile, reconfiguring city with undeniable conceptual cost of returned truths. Orientation anchored early in courtyard/snow; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silver courtyard snow and prism constrain rite's delicacy, charging final image; sensory (frigid air, pulsing light) filters through Elara's serene POV, mirroring internal release. Evolving frost/echoes evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete echo-release) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through knot-dance tightening to final judge's thread; agency in bodily untangling forecloses conformity path with felt burden-cost in sigh. Coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of subtle rebellion via buried humanity emerges organically from rite particulars; final light-wave/ smile offers resonant non-literal answer to conformity's lullaby, reweighting masters' truths without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature ("bodily poetic," psychic threads) stable in single close-POV; rhythmic lyric compression taught early, modulates to peak clarity in rite without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful poetic rhythm; minor overwriting in sustained metaphors (e.g., "knotted cord, tangled skein") across rite but pattern-taught, no loops obscuring closure flash. Propulsion clear to smile.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chaste courtesan harvesting psychic echoes for whisper-rebellion transforms tropes via dance-rite; prism climax inevitable from particulars, bold lyric risk heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
