<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to nurture wonder is embodied in his adaptive playing and cautious thrill, earning Lena's shift; contradictory grief/love impulses act in her sob-to-smile arc. Interiority particular without labels. Final hand-guiding choice forecloses despair with emotional cost legible in tremor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: music loops build density to eclipse convergence, delivering Charged Poise closure in Lena's smile and tender grip amid corona glow. Orientation anchored early (Sage Ridge, session). Cost felt in "tremor of her grief" reconfiguring to harmony.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sagebrush, dusty blanket, and eclipse (sharp-edged sun to shimmering corona, chill) constrain ritual via earth contact and charge final image. Sensory hierarchy (shadows, hum, sob) reflects Elias's priorities. Eclipse evolution mirrors internal shift without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bind grief to wonder) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via box-opening reversal and hand-on-earth deepening, forcing stance crystallization. Agency in Elias's guidance; cost in grief's vibration paid via hopeful note. No abstract stakes; eclipse pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of loss-as-proof-of-love emerges organically via curl-to-earth link, reweighting sorrow in corona moment without statement. Final image ("fragile but genuine" smile) answers via non-literal beauty/wonder resonance. Complexity in enduring ache lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with Elias's perceptual bias (music as "hush of dreaming roots"); voice rhythmic, modulating from low hum to soaring. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Now, Lena," advances goal). No head-hopping; elision of backstory anchors present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (kalimba tines "coax the quiet"); rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in eclipse chill). Minor overwriting in metaphors ("bruised twilight") purposeful for textural lens, not obscuring peak. No loops; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eclipse as grief crucible with kalimba/orange magic transforms therapy trope organically. Risky quiet closure via curl reprise feels inevitable. No templates; particular details (lacquered box, spun gold comma) anchor ingenuity.</comment>
