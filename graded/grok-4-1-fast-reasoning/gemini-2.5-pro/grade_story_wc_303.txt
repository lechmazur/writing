<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously—prestige from violin vs vine's resilience—and final choice to cut/propagate is earned via vine memory and coffee prophecy with treasonous cost. Embodied emotion particular (mulberry ache as sorrow/fertility). No flaws touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vine touch → glacial memory → coffee fissures → cutting/writing DC with legible cost (career/empire traded). Single scene, orientation anchored early ("observatory's viewing port"). Closure reconfigures destiny with leaf image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (refrigerated air vs coffee warmth; Cyphandra vine coils constrain choice). Recurring vine/pedestal charges final cut. Midsummer contrast mirrors internal thaw, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (authenticate lie vs reveal truth) signaled early, accumulates via telepathy/coffee deepening knowledge/options. Agency forecloses empire path with on-page cost (treason report). Pressure coherent under lens, cost unmistakable in "trading an empire for a single green stem."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of authentic breathing world vs sterile empire emerges organically from vine/violin contrast, coffee leaf reweights imagery. Final propagation image answers non-literally with fertile ache. No moralizing; ambiguity in ache lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sensory ghosts, coffee dregs as truth vs stars). Lyrical rhythm modulates with intensity, stable limited POV. Perceptual bias (flora memory over scrolls) character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm/syntax propel without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful (e.g., "tear frozen into music") integrates action. Closure line ("precious cutting safe in his hand") clean, propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: plant telepathy + coffee prophecy subverts imperial star-charts into perforated leaf destiny. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, transforms provenance trope via vine cut.</comment>
