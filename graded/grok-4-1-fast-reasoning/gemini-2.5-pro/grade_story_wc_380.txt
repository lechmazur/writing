<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to reclaim Elara's memories drives consistent micro-choices like the coffee ritual and reaching into gravity, embodied in "pull in the marrow of his bones." Internal endurance against loss culminates in earned hope without tidy epiphany. Minor flaw: backstory on Elara slightly abstracts conflict before anchoring in flowers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from dusk pilgrimage to chamber hum and memory fragment; orientation anchors by para 2 (Silas, docks, post-whale). Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in "a single, brilliant fragment... proof," reweighting displacement premise with felt cost of slip-away. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Salt crystal chamber constrains ritual via "thick, resisting" air and "chilling pressure," charging climax touch; sensory hierarchy (brine drip, fractured lantern stars) filters through Silas's unseen attunement. Whale's gravity pockets evolve causally with decay, mirroring internal shift. POV bias shapes notice of "pockets... tethered to the great creature’s decay."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve memory via anchor) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through coffee spiral map to fragment grasp, narrowing to proof amid loss. Agency in ritual pushes past pressure, foreclosing total retrieval with "ghost... fading" cost legible on page. No coincidence resolution; pressure coheres to hope reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of displaced-not-destroyed memories emerges from particulars like wildflowers and gravity eddies, reweighted in final "one memory at a time" without moralizing. Subtext in ritual failure charges hope's ambiguity. Closing image answers "where deleted memories go" via fragment, lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature ("attuned to the unseen") biases toward gravity hum and salt resonance; voice modulates rhythmically from dusk quiet to climax storm. Lyrical diction ("curdling from peace," "shivering stars") purposeful, no filter excess. Compression in ritual peak heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short gasps at "Then it was gone"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak ("storm of sensation... perfect, stolen afternoon"). Reread ear confirms natural rhythm; closure image clean, evocative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of beached whale warping gravity for memory eddies, coffee divination in salt chamber transforms tropes organically. Risky conceptual frame (displaced memories) follows implications to proof/hope without retreat. Ingenuity peaks in "fingers brushing... pushing past the chilling pressure."</comment>
