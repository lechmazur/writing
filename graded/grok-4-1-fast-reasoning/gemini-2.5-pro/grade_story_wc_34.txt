<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional single-POV interiority with embodied calm under pressure ("driftingly alert calm, his senses attuned not to threat, but to opportunity"); micro-choices like slotting the plate and painting glyphs reveal values with felt sorrow at potential failure ("familiar sorrow of failure began to prick at Elian’s throat"). Final endurance against her decay earns closure smile with visible cost. Contradictory haste in "focused haste" amid deliberate dance satisfies 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density builds from setup to painting fractals, climaxing in golden glyphs and spectral reply as Charged Poise RR with legible conceptual cost ("communion was temporary, a fleeting grace note"). Orientation anchors immediately ("sky-courtyard’s seldom-heard balladeer... suspended above a sea of clouds"). One tightening via timeframe suffices; no slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Misty courtyard constrains choices (slick stones silent boots, mist coils/tastes/swirls into flower) and charges final image (mist coalesces to Silver-Whorl). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (ozone/blossoms for botanist tie); weather (lightning/thunder) drives action. Micro-setting (plinth/beam) integrates purposefully, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (articulate her loneliness) signaled early, escalates via timeframe density ("air grew heavy, pregnant with unshed sound") to agency-driven encoding; fear of failure tests commitment with "heart-stopping second." Cost unmistakable in temporary reply foreclosing full restoration. Protagonist agency under Accumulative lens drives decisive cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection amid entropy emerges organically from glyphs for her "low-frequency ache" to resonant flower/melody dissolve; final "weary smile... it was enough" reweights premise without moralizing, satisfying 9+ test. Subtext in relic's warmth implies ongoing decay cost. Particulars avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (e.g., "tasting of ozone and wild... blossoms"); rhythmic control modulates from calm ("slow, deliberate dance") to tension ("pressure growing"). No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at spectral reply. Perceptual bias ties to Lyra's botany.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pitted and old, made of brass, its six holes worn smooth" advances relic stakes/world); varied rhythm accelerates in painting beat without loops/artifacts. Figuratives purposeful (e.g., "painted silent verses of graffiti art") without muddle in climax. Zero scaffold; closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of balladeer encoding digital ghost via botanist relic/graffiti transforms tropes organically; graffiti fractals/gears as language innovates closure payoff. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes (timeframe poetry) without gimmickry; inevitable in hindsight (+0.3 risk bonus). Non-obvious premise integral.</comment>
