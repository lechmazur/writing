<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation to cultivate foresight compels escalating micro-choices like sensor recalibration post-patch, earning the embodied hollow victory; internal conflict in dedication vs. isolation peaks cleanly at "victory was hollow."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from wind chaos to vector convergence; CR closure lands on-page via "complete sequence" realization with conceptual cost of reverse foresight, legible in final patch grasp.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Steel maze constrains survey paths and wind models, charging closure via epicenter stain; silence as "pressure against eardrums" mirrors internal weight, with haze/rusts sensory bias via investigator lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding quiet tightens accumulatively via patch pivot narrowing ground-to-sky options; cost felt in "hollow" aftermath, agency in frantic recalibration foreclosing prior models.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of foresight's terrible cost emerges via particulars like wind ghosts and convergence anatomy; final image reweights premise non-literally as "weight heavier than all the steel," resonant without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in data-esoteric diction ("micro-anemometers," "vectors"); rhythmic modulation heightens to "frantic energy," no elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring investigation cadence; no loops/artifacts, sensory precision like "haze tasted of salt and rust" propels without overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms disaster tropes via drone-gas-wind confluence physics, inevitable in hindsight; bold conceptual risk in silent "cessation wave" heightens stakes organically.</comment>
