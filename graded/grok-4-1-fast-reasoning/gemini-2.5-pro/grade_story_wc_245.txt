<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied interiority peaks in "mapping his own heart as much as the forest," revealing contradictory grief transforming via tactile choices; final settling of grief earns stasis with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as notes build melody to Charged Poise closure; "final note... in the space between things" delivers on-page reconfiguration with conceptual cost of harmony over silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest constrains all tactile dowsing, charging final moss curtain; body-as-setting (skull pressure, tingling skin) narrows perception purposefully under sensory crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (inner silence) deepens via accumulating notes reweighting emotional pressure; "grief... sharp edges smoothed" shows agency-driven endurance with legible cost in final harmony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of harmony-from-discord emerges via dirge-to-anthem arc, resonating in "every discordant frequency found its place"; final image non-literally answers silence myth without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable tactile perceptual signature ("language of growth and rain flowed into him") biases noticing; rhythmic compression heightens under sonic stress without head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varying rhythm; minor figurative density ("quiet blaze") fits lyric texture but borders overwriting in note-gathering beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory-inverted quest (touch-mapping ultrasonic myth) transforms tropes organically; "dowse the emptiness itself" risks bold perceptual ingenuity, heightening stakes inevitably.</comment>
