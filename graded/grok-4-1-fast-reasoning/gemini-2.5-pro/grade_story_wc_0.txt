<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in the orchid grief—"spike of pure, irrational grief"—earned by prior detachment, compelling the final micro-choice to wipe the pane and seek the shovel with visible cost to his observer stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dust discovery to orchid transfer realization, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure—"he was not an observer... subject to its laws"—with legible cost in shattered detachment at "wiped a small circle clean."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dusty polycarbonate pane as recurring object constrains viewing choices throughout and charges final wipe, anchoring selective sensory details like "silt that smelled of rot" through astrophysicist's biased cosmic filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to rationalize chaos deepens via dust lens to transfer insight, reweighting under Accumulative lens; orchid pang forces stance shift with embodied cost, though abstract "drama" slightly mutes visceral charge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orchid-to-weed transfer image offers resonant non-literal answer to "strip needless drama," reweighting decay-as-exchange without moralizing; emerges organically from particulars, inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in cosmic metaphors ("terrestrial chaos of mud... ugly, alien equation"); rhythmic control modulates from clinical to emotional under pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, and insight without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies purposefully, propulsion peaks in "life of the orchid was quite literally flowing," zero figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Butterfly dust as reality-preprocessing lens transforms astrophysicist-in-greenhouse premise into fresh synthesis of cosmic/terrestrial scales; risk of quiet observational closure heightens stakes inevitability.</comment>
