<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivations root in traits like Kaelen's restlessness, driving micro-choices from staring at water to ritual; Elara's combative tenderness embodies contradiction, softening via scrimshaw to enable climax. Final commitment forecloses home with relational cost on Elara's face. Minor label-speak ("combative tenderness") slightly genericizes voice distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: dialogue plants scrimshaw key, longing intensifies to night ritual causing island's rise (DC) with separation cost legible in "he did not look back again." Orientation anchors docks/Aethelburg by para 2; two shards transition cleanly via "that night." Closure image reconfigures freedom premise with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory details like "salt-crusted supply shed" and "waterfalls of brine" filter through Kaelen's priorities, constraining wade and charging rising island image. Colossal roots as anchors guide climax choice via low tide. Environment mirrors internal cage/freedom via "mossy stone that had not known air."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom via island) signaled early, tightens causally when Elara softens, narrowing options to ritual; agency in "poured his entire being" yields success with felt cost of leaving her "aching acceptance." One reversal suffices; pressure coheres to Charged Poise in drift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of true nature vs. safe cage emerges via scrimshaw unlocking hearts, culminating in resonant final image where Elara accepts as island drifts, reweighting home as "cage" without statement. Subtext in her plea and his murmur invites ambiguity on loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (ocean gray eyes); dialogue subtextual, goal-driven ("It's home" vs. "land is a cage"). Rhythmic prose modulates from fluid docks to thrum pressure; distinct voices in idiom (Elara's thudding boots solidity vs. Kaelen's murmur).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("groaning shudder that churned"); no loops, strong verbs embody action. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("dancer among grunting laborers") risks purple but supports voice without dulling climax thrum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pirate scrimshaw as heart-key summoning tethered island via whale call transforms myth into causal magic; risk in low-tide anchors and essence-pouring feels inevitable from prior longing.</comment>
