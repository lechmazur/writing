<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's receptive curiosity drives consistent micro-choices from examination to planting, with embodied interiority in the "slow smile" and ritualistic potting; minor flaw in undramatized contradictory impulses limits peak complexity, but change feels earned without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as investigative layers build to Charged Poise closure in planting the seed—"a commitment to a future he could not predict"—with legible conceptual cost of long-term dedication; orientation anchors immediately, no lens ambiguity, persistent constraint of patience shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Brook's murmurs recur to mirror thought process and guide drift to symbolic approach, constraining reflective choices; terracotta pot and workshop shelf charge final image as lived-in micro-setting; sensory selection (damp earth, river scent) purposeful without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of engaging the mystery tightens accumulatively through orthogonal investigations, narrowing to Finch realization and planting agency that forecloses dismissal with felt cost of nurturing; one decisive deepening suffices, pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of living mysteries emerges organically from seed's grotesque promise and ritual planting, final image reweighting innovation as patient enigma without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in "cultivate a new kind of enigma" ties character arc to complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with puzzle-maker perceptual signature in "orthogonal approaches" and "living contract"; rhythmic modulation builds from silence to "profound and shared understanding," diction controlled and biased without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/prose propulsion with varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; minor overwriting in dense figuratives ("tangle of lock combinations") purposeful for voice but edges coherence in reflective beats without touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corpse flower seed transforms mystery trope into patient innovation ritual, fresh synthesis of escape rooms and botany feels inevitable; risk in grotesque symbolism heightens stakes organically without gimmickry or derivative templates.</comment>
