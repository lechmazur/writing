<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of skepticism and heart-ache drive micro-choices like precise box rotation; final proof-listening earned by causal buildup. Embodied emotion peaks in "breath hitched" and "tremor in her soul" at climax without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: breadcrumb density culminates in star-aligned light resolving to sigil (DC/RR hybrid). Closure cost legible in "her own [pause] had ended too" and geese clamor, reconfiguring her stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Oculus, pedestal discoloration, and oculus-star alignment constrain climax choice and charge final water-whisper image. Sensory hierarchy (light swirls, goose murmur) filters through Elara's pattern-obsessed POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory liberation) tightens via color chaos to coherent sigil under accumulative lens, narrowing alignment options. Agency in millimeter rotations forces trade-off; cost felt in collective relief foreclosing her isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Skepticism-imagination tension emerges organically via hypothesis-test at "chaotic splash...resolved"; final sigil/water chorus reweights logic-heart premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with perceptual signature (light/architecture patterns, "clean, hard light"); rhythmic control modulates to hushed intensity at box-click without head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; purposeful metaphors (kaleidoscope, spiral) taught early avoid muddle in climax light-resolution. No loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Geese-as-celestial timer and box-as-dormant-machine synthesize fresh alchemy of logic/memory; quiet cosmic alignment transforms trope without gimmickry, risking subtle closure payoff.</comment>
