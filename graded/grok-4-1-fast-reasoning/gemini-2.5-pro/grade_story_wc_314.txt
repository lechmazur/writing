<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Secretly sentimental trait concretely revealed via locket from master's pyre, enabling reverence as missing element and earning soul-deep shift; contradictory logic/intuition impulses act in flock observation abandoning analysis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from frustration to flock overwhelm to ritual, landing CR closure in "logic and intuition finally embraced" with cost of dissolved scaffolding legible on final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Overlooked apple tree and dew-kissed leaf constrain discovery and ritual choice; sensory details like "moss-soft earth" and "scent of ancient ice and new blossoms" mirror internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Frustration freezing passion as dominant stake signaled early tightens via flock's "unpredictable beauty" overwhelming analysis, forcing impulse to tree with felt cost in internal "profound shift."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Harmonizing logic/intuition emerges implicitly via fractal leaves equaling starling chaos, final image reweighting premise without moral; no tidy binary resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third with analytical perceptual signature softening in "allowing his focus to soften"; rhythmic control heightens wonder in vapor weaving without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; minor figurative density like "kaleidoscopic waterfall fracturing sunlight" early risks overwrite but closure image clean, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dew crystal sublimation into "shimmering, silver vapor" offers fresh alchemy synthesis of science and wonder, transforming alchemist trope via nature's intuition.</comment>
