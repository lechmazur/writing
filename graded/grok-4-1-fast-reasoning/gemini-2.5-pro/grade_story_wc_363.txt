<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in trembling fingers and hollow heart; final weaving choice earned by prior memory unspinning with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in faltering last night yet recommencing. Single-POV voice particular to spinner's worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memory-threads builds to CR in tapestry's nova-vanishing, reweighting premise with cost ("stranger to her own heart"). Orientation anchored early in orchard/cottage. No shards; continuous drive legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bamboo stalks' pale light and grooved loom constrain choices, mirroring internal fraying; bead and shuttle as micro-setting charge final nesting/pulsing. Sensory selection urgent and POV-biased to tactile weaving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (message via memory sacrifice) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through falter-to-recommence and final threads foreclosing self-knowledge. Cost unmistakable in "grief for a loss it couldn't name."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of love's erasure emerges implicitly via woven memories and final contextless longing; resonant CR in "peacefully, completely alone" reweights sacrifice without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-POV, perceptual signature weaves thread metaphors consistently; rhythm modulates to grace in final shuttle motion. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies read-aloud, syntax propels to closure flare without loops or muddled metaphors. Motif recurrence (silence, threads) pattern-taught, not artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously synthesizes loom/memory-sacrifice into cosmic map; puzzle/bead transform tropes organically, culminating in inevitable contextless wistfulness. Risky lyric conceit heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
