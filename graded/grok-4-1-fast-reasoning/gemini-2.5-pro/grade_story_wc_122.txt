<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to defeat numbness compels the pivotal stylus drop; embodied vibrations reveal contradictory relief in silence. Interiority concrete via chest-thrumming. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via vibration density to charged poise closure in "resonant stillness"; cost legible in reconfigured numbness. Orientation anchored early; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stone floor constrains vibrations and charges final image of earth-resonance. Sensory hierarchy (tactile over auditory) biases via POV; selective details propel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vibration swelling deepens dominant numbness stake under accumulative lens; Elara's agency in lowering needle narrows to tactile relief with audience's silent tears as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silence reweights from void to presence in final image, answering numbness quest non-literally. Emerges organically from inverted vibrations without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (vibrations as "current flowing through stone") stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation heightens demo pressure without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; no loops, purposeful figurative weave (e.g., "tapestry woven from vibrations") enhances without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Backward needle vibrations synthesize fresh tactile music angle; risk-taking lyric hush transforms deafness trope, inevitable at resonant earth-heart closure.</comment>
