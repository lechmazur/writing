<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's conviction in listening roots clear motivation, shown in patient waiting amid courtyard anxiety; micro-choices like thumbing the locket reveal values under pressure. Contradictory calm versus communal frustration embodied effectively. Final action earned via accumulated traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: story fragments build density to locket pattern recognition. Closure decisive change via "soft, satisfying click" with resonant reconfiguration in communal sigh and forgotten envelope as felt cost. One tightening sufficient; lens coherent to end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Courtyard anchors early with coffee/damp earth, geraniums; locket and star-shaped lock constrain pivotal choice. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's priorities in object history over chaos. Final mailbox image charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend via listening vs. drill) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through fragments narrowing to locket fit. Agency in patient hearing forecloses force path; cost legible in collective sigh and averted violence. Protagonist-driven under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of listening healing emerges from particulars like Petrov's reedy voice and Chen's recall; final garden wish and story-sharing reweight premise non-literally. No moralizing; resonance in "healing had already begun."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in object souls ("soul of an object lived in its history"); dialogue distinct (Mateo's puffing vs. Petrov's hum) and goal-driven. Rhythmic modulation suits calm intensity; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, e.g., short "He slid the locket's back" propels climax; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures. Propulsion breathes with patient build to click.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Locket-as-inverse-key transforms puzzle trope organically; listening via stories offers fresh detective angle. Risk in passive agency heightens communal stakes without gimmick.</comment>
