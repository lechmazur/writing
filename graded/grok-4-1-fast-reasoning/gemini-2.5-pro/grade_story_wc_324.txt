<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation and micro-choices (tuning receiver, translating pulse as lullaby) reveal values under faint-signal pressure, earning Leo's change; competent without safety-hedging. Minor stock phrasing ("technician of sorrow") slightly genericizes voice. Closure choice earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: hearing aid activation → pulse tracking → locating Leo → assurance closes circuit with RR (signal fades to hum). Orientation anchored in first paragraph (atrium, twilight, role). Cost legible in "signal...vanished completely."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium with weeping figs and fountain constrains scanning path via receiver whine, charging final walk into mist. Sensory hush amplifies pulses/breath; mirrors internal defeat. POV-filtered (professional gaze on signals) with evolution (encroaching fog).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (close Elara-Leo circuit) signaled early, tightens via intensifying pulse to Leo's location, then assurance narrows to heart-slow trade-off. Agency in translation forecloses frantic rhythm with felt cost (Leo's crumpled face). Escalation causal, cost in final hum fade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of heart-language connections emerges via pulse shifts, reweighting "crushing silence" in quiet reunion image without moralizing. Subtext in photo reprise and "match her beat" lingers ambiguity of loss. Final image answers premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (pulses as "moth fluttering," "lullaby of thumps"). Dialogue natural/subtextual ("She’s worried about you") advances plot. Rhythmic control peaks in "frantic...softening into a slow, steady beat."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: lines integrate action, pulse metaphors, hush motif without loops. Varied rhythm propels (short breaths amid long descriptive swells). Minor dense figuration ("cathedral...echoes went to die") purposeful, not muddying closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: obsolete hearing aid as heart-pulse medium transforms ghost contact into tactile cartography. Bold premise risks sentimentality but pays via incidental closure walk. No derivative echoes; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
