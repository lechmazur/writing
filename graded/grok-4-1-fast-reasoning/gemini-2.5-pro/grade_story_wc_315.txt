<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the trembling hand versus precise need during calibration, with buckle use revealing hierarchy of values; final steady grip earned by muscle memory anchors motivation in prior failure's debt. Interiority concrete and embodied, avoiding labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from data anomaly to crystal dial turn; on-page Charged Poise closure in "tension draining... hollow ache" with legible emotional cost. Orientation anchored early in arbor and post-static silence; single scene causality tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring buckle and crystal dial constrain pivotal calibration choice; sensory hierarchy (ozone, moss, whine) reflects pattern-seeker's bias, charging final pristine night image. Micro-setting integrates via tactile handling, mirroring internal states without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quiet warning) signaled early, tightens via hand tremor narrowing options; agency in diversion and dial turn forecloses shatter path with felt cost in hammering heart and ache. Accumulative pressure coheres to Charged Poise without coincidence reliance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Watcher's burden emerges organically from vigil debt and silent warning, reweighted in oblivious world sleeping below; final "soundless echo" offers non-literal resonance tying trust to isolation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern drifts and ghost reflections; rhythmic modulation peaks in "fingers flew... heart hammering," compressing under stress while diction stays character-bound. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm accelerates calibration ("One degree, then two"); no loops, coherent metaphors (silence as weight), purposeful overwriting absent in peak beats. Propulsion clear, zero scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi arbor vigilance and parachute muscle memory transforms watcher trope; buckle's tactical risk-taking heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
