<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction peaks in "preserve the lie; to release it was to shatter," driving the keystroke with embodied tremble and betrayal pang; flaws complicate without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discovery density builds to Charged Poise closure at window; cost legible in "heavier with the weight of what was to come"; orientation anchored by para 1.</comment>
