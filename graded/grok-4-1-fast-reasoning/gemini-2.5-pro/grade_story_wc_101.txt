<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory suspicion ("hunger outvoted suspicion") and persistence drive micro-choices to declaration; bell reaction ("stole the air") embodies motivation particular to exile leader, earning intergenerational pivot with felt communal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via donation density to bell tightening; mosaic shards transition legibly ("one moonless evening"); closure CR in "seed best left buried" reconfigures anonymity with conceptual cost of greater growth over identity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor as micro-setting constrains declaration site and evolves from "skeletal structure" to garden, charging final hoe scrapes; sensory hierarchy (wind as marauder) filters through Elara's urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant survival stake deepens accumulatively via bell personalization, forcing declaration trade-off; cost legible in "hard earth" labor and stooped elders re-engaged, agency crystallizing stance without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bell chimes unlock memories ("unlocking rusted gates"), reweighting exile premise organically; final "murmur of shared knowledge" offers non-literal resonance to history-as-bridge without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Close-3rd perceptual signature ("every gust... marauder") biases toward Elara's quiet dread; rhythmic modulation under stress consistent, dialogue sparse but subtextual ("We will honor it").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action ("oranges... tears"); varied rhythm propels without loops, minor figurative density ("amplified quiet") purposeful for tone but tugs high-band edge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sanctions-to-garden synthesis transforms exile trope via bell-memory pivot; arbor risk-taking heightens stakes organically without gimmick.</comment>
