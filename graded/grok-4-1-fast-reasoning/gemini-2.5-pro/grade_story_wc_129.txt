<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's interiority is concrete and embodied, with "luminescent ache" as a recurring, particular motif that layers shyness against empathy; micro-choices like dropping the reed-bird and pointing to the fissure reveal values under pressure. Final dedication earned via cumulative actions, with Lyra's smile providing relational crucible. Minor slip in diagnostic phrasing ("boldly sympathetic") borders label-speak but actions redeem it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of overlooked details builds to tag discovery (pattern break), weaving mats (deepening), and final reconfiguration where ache transforms into shared glow. Orientation anchored early via sculptor in orchard gazing at arbor/crater. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with legible cost in the final gaze uniting reeds and obsidian.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (refracting light, phosphorescent vine, mossy fissure) filter through Kaelen's bias for hidden spaces, constraining search choices. Arbor as recurring micro-setting charges final image, mirroring internal shift from apartness. No white-room; spatial choreography clear in group migration to crater's lip.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging) signaled early via grafting desire; tightening at tag discovery narrows isolation, agency in weaving mats forces trade-off from solo art. Under accumulative lens, cadence shift to invitation crystallizes stance with felt relational cost. Minor abstractness in stakes pre-search, but escalates coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection via small trusts emerges organically from search, vine-tag as collaboration, and reed-mats offering; final image reconfigures transient/permanent duality without moralizing. "Webs of kinship" line integrates subtext via contrast to grand pronouncements. Resonant non-literal answer in ache's transformation lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in luminous, ache-infused diction and overlooked crevices. Rhythm modulates from patient weaving to feverish clarity; Lyra's crystal-clear voice distinct in brief call. No head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in charged final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (e.g., "roots tangle... webs of kinship... spiraling form") risks muddle in reflective opening. No loops or scaffolds; strong verbs propel (hammered, wove, climbed). Closure image crisp, unscathed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crystalline sci-fi world with artisan belonging arc; Echo as "secret gardener" transforms vandal trope organically. Risky poetic tone heightens stakes of ache without gimmickry; final reed-obsidian union inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
