<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority through "trembling certainty" evolving to "profound calm," earning the final acceptance as keeper; traits like analytical artistry drive key perceptions without stock phrasing. Minimal contradictory impulses in-scene limit 9+; change feels earned via journey causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as crack patterns and revelations densify to CR closure ("mentor’s truth" constellation reweights premise with conceptual cost of guardianship). Orientation anchored early; single-shard progression tightens seamlessly to legible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cracks as "deliberate language" and punch-hole constrain path choices; starlit vault charges final image with shifting schematics mirroring internal shift. Sensory selectivity (cold mist muffling hum) reflects POV urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find fortress) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via locks and mentor revelation narrowing seeker to keeper; agency in punch-use and step-through forecloses old life with felt responsibility cost. Minor abstractness in initial stakes slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mapping unspoken truths emerges organically from crack-stars to CR final image ("final route... new beginning") reweighting premise without moralizing; resonance in mentor's sacrifice lingers via ambiguity of personal cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (chaos as "secret geometry"); rhythmic modulation under pressure (short sentences in mist passage) heightens texture without leakage. Lyrical diction consistent and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm varying sentence length; vivid propulsion in "air wavered... stepped through." Repetitive "perfectly" (calculated, round, seamless) in rising beats creates minor template cadence drag (−0.4), but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography as divination via cracks/punch transforms trope into inevitable CR; risk in mystical vault payoff feels organic and bold, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
