<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the shift from analytical sensor use to dropping it for raw participation, earning the merger with visible embodied cost in floating lightness and rooted legs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from faint blues/greens to overwhelming symphony and CR closure in the waveform syllable, with cost legible in post-merger heaviness; orientation anchored by para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elm leaf fossil as micro-setting constrains focus and charges final bridge image; cave's ozone/tide/tang pressures squeeze and enables float without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to voice the unknown escalates via sensor overload to participatory float under Accumulative lens, agency in opening self foreclosing observer path with physical gravity cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final waveform and fossil touch offer resonant non-literal answer to bridging worlds, reweighting quest from abstract to tangible without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases toward emotional strata and heat-maps; rhythmic control heightens immersion in "thrum of the chamber" without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion with varied syntax; minor figurative density in peak ("symphony of sensations") purposeful under textural lens, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotion-heatmaps and cave-consciousness merger feels inevitable from fossil anchor; bold post-hibernation frame transforms mysticism tropes organically.</comment>
