<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between brute force (past lesson) and dream interpretation act in scene, culminating in earned choice to eat the seal with embodied tremble; flaws like fractured sight drive desperation without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as visions densify to Conceptual Repricing closure ("stitched the past and future into a single, seamless moment") with undeniable conceptual cost of transcendence amid collapse; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bunker micro-setting (crack spilling dirt/water, swirling ankles) constrains storm-tightened choices and charges final rain-on-face image; sensory hierarchy (moan of wind, ozone taste) mirrors perceptual shift purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock directive before ruin) signaled early, escalates via dream-deepening that narrows to seal-eating agency under Accumulative lens; cost legible in flooded ankles and foreclosed maintenance path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of paths growing walkers emerges organically via shifting spiral image and final realization, reweighting premise without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in "rain on his face for the very first time."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of fractured time ("hands... perceived through memory... premonition"); rhythmic control modulates from smeared gray to ignited present without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short shudders amid lyrical swells) propels to closure; purposeful metaphors like "chrysalis" cohere without muddle, though minor overwriting in vision block nudges from 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-fracture guardian trope via seal-eating transcendence risks lyrical compression that heightens stakes, feeling inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
