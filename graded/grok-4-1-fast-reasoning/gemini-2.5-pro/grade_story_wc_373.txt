<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to capture trust breaking intensifies through failed attempts, culminating in the steadfast lie that earns closure; contradictory impulses in chaos/plea/bribe vs. direct confrontation act on-page. Interiority concrete via recorder's "warmth" and sound as "currency." Final choice forecloses Silas's deal with relational cost, rooted in family debt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: failures (crab pots -> plea -> bribe) therefore narrow to lie, delivering DC closure when Eva tosses fob ("With a snarl of disgust"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph (pier, market, Elara). Persistent constraint (fob flaw knowledge) shapes tactics; cost legible in Silas's panic and expulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Phosphorescent kelp glow constrains climax confrontation ("stepped directly into the kelp's eerie green glow"); sensory details (brine/mildew/secrets, lapping tide) filter via Elara's priorities, evolving with dawn light to charge final image. Spatial choreography clear amid throng/pots/piling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thwart fob sale) signaled early, escalates causally through three failed attempts narrowing options to lie; agency in lie forces trade-off with visible cost (Eva's rejection redefines Silas's status). Pressure coheres to Charged Poise in Elara's slip into shadows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of brittle loyalty emerges via fob's "deliberate imperfection" mirroring trust's snap, reweighted in ironic lie and captured sound; final image ("tiny recorder warm") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in Silas's "landed fish" denial layers ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (sounds as "flavor," "currency"); dialogue natural/subtextual (Elara's "flaw" lie persuades via intimacy, Silas sputters distinctly). Rhythm modulates tension; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel via image/action (e.g., "hip... sent crab pots tumbling"); no loops/artifacts, figurative purposeful ("coiled serpent," "snarl of disgust") without muddle in climax. Clean propulsion to dawn image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sound-recording motivation transforms pirate-market tropes, with fob-flaw lie as non-obvious turn grown from grandfather's imperfection; risk in direct confrontation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
