<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation for balance is consistent and intensifies through actions like brushing the shelf symbol, but sparse interiority lacks contradictory impulses during the climax placement of the pellet, reducing embodied depth in the pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from aisles to nexus; closure's rune bloom and dissolution deliver CR with conceptual cost of Kael and library fading in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Library's spiraling aisles, phantom river of light, and star-chart lectern constrain Kael's path and charge the final fading image; sensory details like cold pellet weight integrate purposefully through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of correcting the timeline tightens via converging lights to pellet activation under accumulative lens; off-page pretender mutes visceral cost, though self-dissolution pays on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet balance emerges organically from whispers to unraveling; final "graceful collapse" image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting violent skew without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with cosmic perceptual signature in phrases like "quiet hum between heartbeats"; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in the rune's silent bloom without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel from setup to "soft as falling silk" tremor; no loops or artifacts, with metaphors like "phantom limb" coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of titan librarian wielding ink-rune against cosmic lie feels inevitable; risk in abstract accumulative drive transforms throne pretender trope through library's erasure.</comment>
