<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poet's motivation to grasp time's texture roots in consistent traits and intensifies via pattern study; touching the rope in climax embodies internal conflict between binary desperation and nuanced poetry, earning the threshold choice with endurance cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as observation density builds to CR closure; "I choose to remain the poet" decisively reconfigures the illusory choice, with cost legible in the "difficult freedom" and watchful starlight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto as "earthen womb" and frayed rope constrain reflection and poetic realization; these recur to charge the final image of softened light integrating around him.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of time's texture deepens via agency in uncovering layers, forcing stance crystallization; cost unmistakable in declaring threshold awareness amid species twilight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of dual existence emerges organically from pattern, rope, and choice; final "stand in the doorway" reweights binary premise with resonant, non-literal endurance cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature (cosmic choreography, sky-river) and rhythmic modulation sustain under pressure; dialogue subtext sharp in "library of burned books" retort.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figuratives (weave of a moment) propels accumulatively; zero loops, varied rhythm peaks cleanly at "passion... subtle, rising tide."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Non-obvious third-path synthesis from pattern and past escape transforms alien-choice trope; risk of CR ending feels inevitable via poetic lens.</comment>
