<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (kinship/terror pang while watching offerings) compel the final micro-choice; motivation rooted in ghostwriter life earns renunciation with cost. Minor epiphanic polish in "she suddenly understood" edges below 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of observations builds to Charged Poise closure when twig is wedged in, reconfiguring isolation with legible cost ("severing her last link"). No orientation debt; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (droplets on lotus petals, plinking drips) filter through Elara's priorities, constraining choice via wet stone/platform; rainbows charge final image, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnect via letting go) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through others' offerings to agency-driven addition; cost felt in hesitation but lacks one live option foreclosure for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection emerges organically from particulars (secrets to shared web); final image of twig strengthening structure offers resonant, non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (thread/weaving motifs); rhythmic prose modulates elegantly under decision pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively; minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("damp silk," "prismatic quiet") slightly muddles without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostwriter secrets and twig in "Confluence" transforms connection trope; risk in lyric accumulation pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
