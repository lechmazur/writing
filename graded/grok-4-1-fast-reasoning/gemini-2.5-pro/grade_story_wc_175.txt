<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through ritualistic building, embodied in "hands a blur" at climax; micro-choices like specific knots reveal values. Minor weakness: contradictory impulses not shown acting simultaneously in scene, yielding resolute competence without raw struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to sparse butterfly trickle breaking pattern, culminating in CR via last butterfly's passage and shadow on hands with conceptual cost of finality. Orientation anchored early in grotto; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Verdant grotto and floating earth pocket constrain material gathering and butterfly paths; damp moss, silvervine, stones tactile and purposeful. Final dissolving structures charge image, mirroring transience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring histories) signaled early; escalation via arrival forcing faster building narrows to final knot/spire as last butterfly passes, agency-driven under accumulative lens with legible cost of irreversible end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transient histories emerges organically through lattices/knots as earth-memory signals; final image ("soft place for it to land") offers resonant CR reweighting loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (world's "hidden grammar" in soil/stone, filigree data); rhythmic prose modulates from anticipation to fulfillment, diction purposeful and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/action; rhythm varies, no loops, figurative language (e.g., "blushing stillness") purposeful in lyric accumulative mode without muddle. Minor density in opening descriptions doesn't dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: eco-elegy via butterfly pilgrimage through human-woven signals in cloud-grotto, transforming tropes with ritual data-translation; risk of poetic conceit heightens stakes organically.</comment>
