<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in stellar doubt act during high-risk calibration decision, earning final purpose shift with cost of future-charting renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via signal density increase to coherent echo; CR closure lands on-page with conceptual cost in "curator of the last one" realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ambered field constrains power diversion choice, flickering under risk; coin on console charges final image, filtering cosmic chaos through Kael's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightens via stubborn pulse forcing coin-mediated recalibration; agency in draw and power commitment forecloses sensors with felt burnout threat, reweighting via echo revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of listening to ghosts non-literally answers purpose question, reweighting prophecy from future-alignment to past-curation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in esoteric diction like "wavelength align" modulates with intensity; rhythmic control heightens signal emergence under doubt-pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds propels via varied syntax; "bruised light and screaming physics" figurative cluster purposeful in opening chaos payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Post-contraction coin-lots for ghost-signals synthesizes fresh sci-fi frame; risk in backwards prophecy fulfillment heightens stakes organically.</comment>
