<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in clutching the "terrifying comfort" of the fragment; final erasure earned by ambition's monastic focus, with embodied terror in "frantic heartbeat."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via memory density crescendo to "cataclysmic roar," yielding CR in total blankness; cost legible in "no memories, no past, no name."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hyperbolic maze constrains climax choice, warping fragment via "non-Euclidean angles"; yew clearing charges final image as origin/erasure point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake deepens from fraying wife-memory to full dissolution, agency in aligning geometry; cost unmistakable in post-torrent "green scent" stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Sandpaper" realization and blank maze reweight time-quest premise obliquely; emergent from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("fading photographs projected onto a living screen") modulates rhythmically under stress, stable limited POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density propels reverie to roar without loops; varied syntax in climax "fragment did not shatter; it simply ceased" breathes perfectly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry-time artifact synthesis feels inevitable; transforms maze trope boldly into anti-time weapon.</comment>
