<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's cool-headed transliteration enables embodied micro-choices like humming counter-frequencies and tapping the spike, rooting motivation in consistent traits; calm under chaos earns the climax voicing without unearned epiphany, though internal contradiction is more implied than simultaneous.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory chaos densifies to the hollow's silence; on-page closure via spike strike manifests fleeting echo as Charged Poise RR with conceptual cost of loss palpably defined in "three heartbeats" and dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sound wave garden constrains zigzag path and spike-tapping via shattering shockwaves and chasms; recurring crystallized frequencies filter through Kaelen's sonic bias, charging final hollow image without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to catch echo tightens via pang of loss deepening to hollow's pressure under Accumulative lens; agency in intuitive pursuit forecloses dissolution-risk paths with fleeting manifestation cost viscerally felt, though no live option explicitly traded.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of voicing primal loss emerges organically from echo pursuit and final shimmer as non-literal answer reweighting noisy cosmos; resonant image of "held breath, last goodbye" layers ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with sonic perceptual signature ("high, thin whine," "dead thud") modulates rhythm under chaos; stable single-POV distance biases toward emotional textures, purposeful compression taught early pays off in climax poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied syntax and sonic density suiting textural lens, high info per line; minor figurative density in peak ("antenna for sorrow") borders overwriting but coheres without muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic garden, emotional transliteration, and silence-voicing transforms myth-trope into inevitable quest; risk in abstract physics heightens stakes via spike's charged reprise without gimmickry.</comment>
