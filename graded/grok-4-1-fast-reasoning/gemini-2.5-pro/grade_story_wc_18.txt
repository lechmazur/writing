<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's grounded traits (steady hand in silica/heat) contradict and enable her ritualistic floating mind, compelling the breath choice with embodied cost (frozen tear). Final endurance of momentary success earns closure without tidy epiphany. Father's dream anchors motivation concretely via sextant cue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: breath density builds frost into mountains (climactic tightening), reconfiguring dream from stolen to readable map. CR closure lands on-page with legible cost ("fracture line... crumbled... did not feel loss") in final paragraph. Orientation anchored early (workshop/orchard by para 2); single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frost filigree on branches and mirror constrains ritual (cold surface for breath plumes), charging final empty-mirror image. Sensory selection (sharp air, glittering shards) narrows via mirror-maker bias. Ruined orchard evolves causally (twilight frost pierces fog).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recreate dream) signaled early; breath ritual drives accumulative deepening to mountain formation, foreclosing permanence with shatter cost. Agency in micro-choices (inhale/hold/exhale) narrows options under frost constraint. One tightening suffices, cost felt in triumph amid fragility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sympathetic boundary-erasure emerges via breath-frost lattice, resonating in final sextant grasp as readable map without moralizing. Complexity lingers in momentary triumph's cost. Father's fog-dissolved stars reweight via on-page recreation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (glass/frost geometry via mirror-maker eye). Prose texture modulates rhythmically (short breaths in ritual to expansive landscape). No head-hopping; diction grounded yet lyrical.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (e.g., "exhaled a plume... ice crystals began to build"); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor figurative density in frost peaks purposeful, no loops/muddle. Closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mirror-maker's breath sculpts father's lunar dream in frost, transforming fog trope via sympathy ritual. Risky lyric accumulative drive inevitable in hindsight; glass mountains payoff bold.</comment>
