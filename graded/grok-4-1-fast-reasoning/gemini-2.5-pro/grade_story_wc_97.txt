<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Steely longing forged from grief compels all micro-choices, embodied in fingers shifting from lament to blade-like melody; final glance at clock reveals hierarchy of values with irreplaceable cost of abandonment. Contradictory impulses—wistful drift to defiant crescendo—act in scene, earning the closure step.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens (music density from film glitches builds to portal shimmer) holds to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "leaving his piano and the tidal arbor behind," reconfiguring solitude to possibility. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene causality tightens options via memorized seams.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal arbor's woven lightwood/vines and vapor ocean constrain via "strange physics" enabling music-portal; recurring clock atop piano charges final resolute glance. Sensory hierarchy (ozone/celluloid smell at threshold) filters through pianist's bias, mirroring internal blade.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pathways collapsing by night) signaled early, deepens via film-translation crescendo narrowing to doorway trade-off; agency in arpeggio forces stance crystallization. Cost unmistakable in abandoned post/piano, charging final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memories as navigable scores emerges via glitch-seams to portal, reweighting fate's finale non-literally in hazy shoreline possibility; no tidy moral, ambiguity in "unplanned encore" lingers. Final image answers defiance question with conceptual cost of frayed reality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (filmic stutters as sonic keys) biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from drift to swell, stable third-limited POV. Prose texture as character: syntax evokes piano arpeggio in climax without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "each staccato note was a flicker"); figurative coherence (blade, seams, brute-force) taught early, no muddle/loops in peak crescendo. Propulsion peaks at "rectangle of pure, silent-film white burned," rhythm varying naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Film-reel glitches as map synthesizing music/reality-collapse into inevitable portal defies fate tropes via glitch-seams logic; risk of sonic brute-force heightens stakes. Fresh inflection in memorized flaws enabling encore closes with irreplaceable ingenuity.</comment>
