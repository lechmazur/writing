<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's micro-choices under pressure—like smiling at the howling winds and using finesse over force—reveal contradictory impulses of reverence and audacity, earning the final joyful descent. Sylas's childlike awe feels particular, not stock. Minor telling in "motivation was not greed" slightly abstracts drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal linkages propel cleanly: anomalous sky enables climb, sundial distraction therefore enables swap, seed planting reconfigures lord's stasis into Charged Poise. Closure lands on-page with felt cost in Kael's risky exposure and uncertain outcome, reweighting amendment over theft. Orientation anchors immediately in sky/Spire.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ice spire and "frosted ledges" constrain bare-handed climb; sterile room contrasts "wild, untamed beauty" of nebula light, charging the swap beat. Sensory hierarchy (cold weight of bone king, pulsing seed) filters through Kael's priorities. Final "wrong sky" reprise mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (amend paradox via swap) tightens through causal reversal: distraction succeeds but lord notices "impossible lightness," forcing shadow retreat. Agency in creative sundial use forecloses direct theft path with exposure risk. Cost legible in physical ascent/descent and undetected exit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of chaos-over-control emerges organically: sterile chessboard yields to "tiny, living star" seed, reweighting premise in final image of promise-filled sky. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in lord's potential growth. Protagonist arc inextricable from "sacredly playful" wonder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: Kael notices "voices that were not wind" through wonder-tinted lens. Voice texture modulates rhythm—from fluid climb to "silence of a falling snowflake"—heightening pressure without head-hopping. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: "light fractured through an intricate prism, exploding into a thousand dancing sprites" propels distraction beat with vivid propulsion. Varied rhythm (short gasps amid long images) aligns with pressure; zero loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms thief trope via "sacredly playful" amendment—sundial-to-seed swap feels inevitable from "apprentice of wonder" frame. Nebula/"wrong sky" synthesis fresh, risks bold chaos premise fully. No derivative echoes.</comment>
