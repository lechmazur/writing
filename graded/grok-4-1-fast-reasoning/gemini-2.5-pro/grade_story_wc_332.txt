<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silas's obsession rooted in consistent traits compels escalating rituals, with embodied tension peaking in "hands trembled" at vitalization. Contradictory impulses emerge in patient waiting versus hammering heart, earning the final contentment. Interiority particular via light-language perceptions avoids stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragments build to fog-hazed sunrise, delivering on-page RR (dream coalesces) with felt cost of ended chase in "long chase over." Orientation anchored early in ritual. Single tightening via charged morning suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Palette and glass plate constrain choices, charging final swirl; sensory hierarchy (mist, sea salt, prismatic haze) filters via Silas's light-bias. Micro-setting (basin, candle) guides development, mirroring internal void. Vivid yet economical, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream) signaled early, escalates accumulatively to fog dawn narrowing options; agency in persistent photography culminates in vitalization with legible cost of hollowed days filled. One deepening reweights knowledge of cipher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of longing emerges organically from light-fragments resolving "luminous absence"; final image reconfigures premise without moralizing, inviting reflection via shimmering presence. Resonance from particulars like palette wells avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in color-shadow diction; rhythmic modulation builds to closure glow. Compression in ritual taught early, legible under Accumulative lens. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; figurative language purposeful in light motifs, no muddle or loops in peak (vellum glow). Read-aloud rhythm breathes with ritual cadence, minor density in openings doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of photography-alchemy transforms dream-capture trope; palette's light-absorption feels inevitable, risking magical logic that heightens stakes without gimmick. Bold lyric accumulation charges closure organically.</comment>
