<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in past failure compel the final resolve; contradictory impulses between data-driven rival and poetic lens act in shard interpretation. Minor slip in reflective summary of rivalry slightly dilutes embodied pressure before storm. Shard vision moment earns change with felt cost of endured defeat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as storm density builds to shard revelation; orientation anchored early in window-tracing and Adagio spires. Closure as CR lands cleanly in final image of holding shard, reweighting thesis with conceptual cost of past revolution's failure. No causality breaks; ritual sets motivated ellipsis to vision payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Baroque details constrain via mirror-covering ritual and charge final shard hold; sensory hierarchy (cool filigree, pearlescent waves) reflects poetic POV bias. Squall's visible time uniquely pressures choices, evolving with events. Shard as micro-setting enables revelation, mirroring internal stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (poetic thesis vs sterile data) signaled early, tightens accumulatively in shard's humanizing visions during storm. Agency in exposing shard forces interpretive trade-off; cost legible in reignited fire against past loss. Final poise forecloses cynicism with emotional endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of art as dam against oblivion emerges organically from shard images (arranging petals, weeping at sunset) reweighting premise. Final image answers central dispute non-literally, embracing ambiguity of fragile proof vs rival's narrative. No moralizing; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with poetic perceptual signature (caesura in shard's cut) biases details consistently. Lyrical diction and rhythm modulate with storm intensity, compressing under pressure. Voice distinct and controlled, prose as character in "burnished sorrow" sigh.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering ("frozen light," "pearlescent light") taught early, propels via varied rhythm without loops or scaffolds. Minor density slip in opening reflection but no artifacts dull closure; read-aloud propulsion peaks in storm break. Final line recharges shard motif crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi archaeology and lyrical reinterpretation transforms trope of lost civ into poetic revolution. Risky visible-time squall and shard visions feel inevitable from baroque setup. Bold tone sustains singular vision without hedging.</comment>
