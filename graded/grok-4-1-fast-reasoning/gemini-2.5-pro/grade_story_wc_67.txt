<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization excels with concrete interiority and contradictory compassion shown in her "weaves truth carefully" omissions, culminating in her "heart a heavy, knowing stone" that earns the closure's ironic peace for Kael. Kael's fragility drives credible endurance without stereotypes. Micro-choices under ritual pressure reveal values with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: ritual steps build density to Charged Poise closure as the chair stops and powder scatters, reconfiguring grief into illusory stasis with Elara's felt cost legible in the final line. Orientation anchors early (Elara's role, gallery, client arrival). Single scene with fluid room transitions fits defaults seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constraints charge closure: Kiln Room brazier enables powder creation, Stillness Room chair and sunlight dictate the exact pouring moment. Sensory details (charcoal dust, creak) filter through Elara's priorities, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Chair's worn wood evolves tactilely to anchor final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crystallizing grief) signaled early, accumulates texturally through ritual steps to one decisive tightening: Kael's wait for chair's stop forces renunciation of chaos for contained act. Cost unmistakable in powder's scatter and Elara's knowledge of returning grief. Agency coherent in Kael's pouring.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of "mirage of safety" emerges organically from particulars like withheld mask suicide and ritual omissions, reweighted in final image of "exquisite mirage" without moralizing. Subtext in Elara's selective truths invites ambiguity on illusion's value. Resonance inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elara's perceptual signature (scent of charcoal, light motes) biases details purposefully. Voice texture distinct in rhythmic prose modulating to hushed ritual. Dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("we don't preserve the person").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose propels with high density and varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful, not muddy (e.g., "tiny star" motes heighten climax). Final line's image resolves with precision, read-aloud flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously transforms grief ritual with ash-scattering mechanics and kintsugi twist, synthesizing into inevitable "vanishing point" closure. Risky poetic frame heightens stakes organically, fresh beyond tropes.</comment>
