<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara's motivation intensifies convincingly from curiosity to "curdle into a need for truth," compelling the rooftop micro-choice; Elias's traits reveal through patient teaching without stock epiphanies. Final keeper role earned via prior causality with cost of shattered illusions. Minor slip: Elias borders archetypal as "lingering echo" without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whispers accumulate to rooftop CR where seal impression reconfigures illusions with conceptual cost of new responsibility. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via note invitation suffices. Closure cost legible in "lies were gone, but the truth was a far more beautiful and intricate story."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Seal as micro-setting constrains interrogation and charges final image, pressed "like a promise"; rooftop Perseids mirror lives' transience. Sensory details (cold teacups, dust/lavender) filter through Clara's linguistic bias. Environment guides choice: open sky loosens Elias's secrets.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. lies) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to rooftop stance crystallization; agency in note/questions forecloses illusions. Cost felt in reconfiguration to keeper role. Minor abstractness in early stake declaration slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory-truth emerges organically from tea lies to collective soul realization; meteors reweight lives as "stories, arriving and ending in a flash." Resonant non-literal close avoids moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: buildings as "grammar/syntax." Voice textured ("rustle of dry leaves"), rhythmic; sparse dialogue subtextual, goal-driven ("What is this, really?"). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm/syntax; metaphors consistent (linguistic galaxy spiral). No loops/artifacts; final line recharges seal motif cleanly. Read-aloud ear perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: architect's essence in mortar transforms ghost trope via linguistic conceit. Risky rooftop reveal inevitable from particulars; bold conceptual integrity heightens stakes.</comment>
