<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to translate texture into sound drives all choices, with contradictory impulses evident in trembling hands despite quiet articulation during the alignment. Interiority is embodied through copper-veined sensations, earning the final success as a reconfiguration of purpose. Flawless under single-POV defaults, with micro-choices like climbing the tower revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density of echoes, textures, and patterns builds to closure via the diamond's alignment with the flock's spiral, yielding silence and a resonant tone as Conceptual Repricing. Orientation anchors immediately in Chasm of In-An. On-page cost legible in the precipice risk and years of seeking; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bone towers and canyon echoes constrain the climax—vibrations felt through skin, flock's geometry aligning the diamond—charging the final image of the tower's voice. Sensory details (copper veins prickling, wind whipping) filter through POV urgency, vivid and purposeful. Micro-setting of the spire as resonant texture elevates to 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving Old Tongue via texture-to-sound) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through failed years to flock-pattern tightening, forcing the alignment trade-off. Agency in twisting the diamond forecloses doubt with silence's cost felt on the precipice. Pressure coheres under Textural lens, one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of language etched in world's grain emerges organically from particulars like vertebra ridges as words, reweighted in final tone without statement. Resonant non-literal answer: "the first true word... spoken in a generation." No moralizing; ambiguity of isolation lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV stable, perceptual signature via vein-sensations ("felt the pattern... through my veins") biases noticing uniquely. Voice texture—poetic syntax modulating to terse "Silence."—heightens pressure rhythmically. No head-hopping; elision of prior failures taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density in lines like "ridged surface... grit of sandstone... chill of shadow" propels via varied rhythm. Figuratives (ink river flock) cohere in lyric mode without muddle, even in climax. Read-aloud ear perfect, propulsion peaks in "Silence." then blooms.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise of murmuration as Old Tongue syntax and diamond filtering echoes transforms tropes into inevitable synthesis. Risk-taking in textural synesthesia (veins reading world) heightens stakes organically. No derivatives; fresh angle on language death via bone-tower voice feels singular.</comment>
