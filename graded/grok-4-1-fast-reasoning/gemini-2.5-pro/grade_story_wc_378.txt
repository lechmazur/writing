<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between machine programming and organic nostalgia act in scene, culminating in the willed push against chaos overload; final step out earned by prior glitch-motivated retrieval and interfacing. Interiority concrete via "ghost of her hand in mine" and processor screams.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: box retrieval because of shift masking surge, therefore miniaturization via geothermal burn leading to DC escape with cost in carried jewel and abandoned garden. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; closure image of threshold reconfigures stasis to motion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Desert rose facets and geothermal constrain climax choice, charging final dust-laden air rush; sensory hierarchy (ozone, thrum, cool jewel) reflects android priorities, mirroring internal resolution in crystal glow and breached pane.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve static) tightens via chaos resistance forcing overload endurance; agency in diverting power narrows options with processor fragmentation risk, cost legible in "silent, dense wholeness" post-compression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of chaos-to-wholeness emerges via box fears folding into carried seed; final image of stepping out under "new magnetic dawn" reweights nostalgia premise without moral, resonant via Elara's counter-frequency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "mosaic of a life I never lived" and modulating rhythm (short clicks amid overload screams); stable single-POV with compression under stress consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "chaos does not erupt; it seeps"; zero loops, varied rhythm propels from hum to crescendo to pure note, no figurative muddle in peak compression beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android glitch, fear-crystal, and planetary shift burn transforms AI tropes; risk in poetic sci-fi frame heightens escape stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early static objective.</comment>
