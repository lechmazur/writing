<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Reluctant caretaker's weariness and "stubborn spark" motivate concrete micro-choices like willful assembly without touch, embodied in furrowed brow and halting motions; internal contradiction between cynicism and duty earns the final endurance with felt cost in spent nut and returning chill. No stock phrasing; traits shown through actions. Minor telling in "motivation was simple" line slightly abstracts but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: horn cue triggers assembly under frost pressure, beacon pulse creates path (DC via traveler's exit), closure as Charged Poise in cracked nut and Elias's heavy sit reconfiguring cursed duty with undeniable weariness cost. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (perch, labyrinth, horn). Single scene causality tight, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cliffside labyrinth with shifting granite/gears, copper birds, frost filigree constrain assembly timing and bird disruption, charging final ice-armored cliffs image; sensory hierarchy (wind-whipped coat, bone ache, subsonic thrum) reflects Elias's weary priorities. Details evolve causally (crystals bloom mid-act). Micro-setting (tin box, ledge) guides choices perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide traveler pre-frost) signaled early via horn, tightens via bird patrols/frost onset narrowing to beacon assembly; agency in willful coaxing forecloses inaction path with nut-spent cost visible on page. Escalation coherent under accumulative lens with frost crystals as cadence shift. No abstract stakes; pressure viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of graceless beauty in cursed guardianship emerges organically from halting assembly and final "sliver of meaning," reweighting premise via spent nut/cracked husk image without moralizing; subtext in "hereditary disease" inheritance lingers ambiguously. Final action resonates non-literally on duty's quiet cost. No tidy resolution; complexity in reluctant spark endures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with Elias-specific perceptual bias (weary nonchalance, mechanical patrol geometry); rhythmic texture modulates from resigned drift to furrowed concentration under stress, diction controlled (e.g., "graceless beauty" motif purposeful). No head-hopping or withholding; compression in assembly beat heightens immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with lines multi-tasking (e.g., "stuttering, halting motion" advances craft/character/atmosphere); varied rhythm/read-aloud flow, no loops or scaffolds—template check clean. Minor figurative density in frost "filigree of impending doom" purposeful, not muddled. Propulsion peaks crisply at beacon thrum/activation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwork horror, inherited telekinesis-as-assembly, vibration-map beacon transforms maze tropes via specific "offhandedly exact" will and nut power; risk in graceless process heightens stakes organically. Premise inevitable in hindsight, no derivatives—nut's "solidified night" drop charges closure uniquely.</comment>
