<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in skepticism clashing with trail pull ("disappointingly unscientific"); final amber placement earns change with cost of sacrificed isolation, no unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to CR closure via convergence realization and amber sacrifice; cost legible in "quiet click" nexus moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory hierarchy (damp earth, drizzle patter) filters through skeptic POV; footprints and amber constrain choices and charge final image perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chemistry of homecoming) tightens accumulatively via felt pull and anticipation prickle; agency in center convergence forecloses skepticism with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared making emerges organically from convergence pattern; amber reprise reweights isolation motif in resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in scientific cataloging ("priming through suggestive iconography"); rhythmic modulation builds to intuitive clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops; "bronze quiet" recurs purposefully to frame shift from absence to foundation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh post-Contact pilgrimage skepticism transformed via amber sacrifice; conceptual integrity in human-made convergence feels inevitable.</comment>
