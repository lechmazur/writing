<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via pulse-counting reveals contradictory impulses of anxiety and focus during ink-drawing; final renunciation of "curse" view earned by ritual causality with embodied cost in thumb-pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as failed fractals build to ink diagram epiphany (CR closure) with legible cost in pattern collapse; orientation anchored early in observatory hush, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frigid slate and porcelain shard constrain drawing choice; snow-muffled silence and dome lens charge final shard-gleam image, mirroring internal gaps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fetch wisdom) signaled early tightens via ink shift from chaos to diagram under Accumulative lens; agency in guided drawing forecloses failure path with connection-loss cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of meaning-in-gaps emerges organically from ink-voids chart and "architecture in the darkness" line, reweighting premise in final pulse-realization without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature in pulse-rhythm and ink-swirl diction; rhythmic control heightens ritual pressure without elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful pulse refrain propels accumulative build; no loops or artifacts dull closure image of collapsing ink and gleaming shard.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious ink-defragment synthesis transforms digital-ghost trope via organic chaos theory; risk in ephemeral method heightens stakes, inevitable in epiphany hindsight.</comment>
