<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied emotions peak in "joy... burst behind his eyes" and "weight... settle in his chest," driving contradictory impulses that earn the final empathetic cost; motivation fuses insight with empathy through micro-choices like touching the petal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to Charged Poise closure in "decant the joy, leaving the sorrow behind," with legible cost in the soul-residue image; single scene causality intact from sensing to separation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber grotto's "resonant crystals" provide baseline hum constraining work, while "dusk bled fully... amber walls began to glow" charges phial moment and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of perfect half-truth tightens via full-emotion subsumption, forcing agency in separation with unmistakable cost: "residue in his own soul"; escalation via textural density under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unsustainable half-truths emerges organically from "flower without roots," resonating in non-literal final image of client's "beautiful lie" against Kael's residue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in static-sensing diction; rhythmic control modulates from calm "slow, centering breath" to peak "rush of fizzing, electric noise."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density in multi-job lines like "positive charge of shared laughter... negative drag of suspicion"; varied rhythm, coherent metaphors (miniature storm), zero loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of static electricity for emotion-craft transforms counterfeit trope; risk in empathetic cost inevitability heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
