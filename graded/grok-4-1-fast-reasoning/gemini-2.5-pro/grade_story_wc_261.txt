<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to read scars drives consistent micro-choices like coffee-ring examination and tunneling, with embodied contradiction in pursuing peace that reopens wounds. Interiority particular via scar geography and plant pulse. Final endurance as archivist earned by prior obsession's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ivy pulse to shared panic, culminating in CR closure ("His search for closure was the very thing that kept him wounded") with legible conceptual cost in hourglass gaze. Anchors clear early; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy vine and coffee rings constrain choices (ivy bleeds into concentration; rings form tunnel entry); hourglass charges final image, mirroring unseeable time/cost. Sensory selection POV-biased and purposeful, dawn light sterile against ache.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scar closure) signaled early, tightens via tunnel deepening that reveals "perfect, awful preservation," narrowing to renunciation with cost (tremor in ivy, raw agony). Agency in excavation forecloses healing path under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: closure-seeking perpetuates wounds, resonant via scar-door image and archivist realization reweighting premise without moralizing. Final line non-literal answer to obsession's paradox.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (scars as narratives, pulses sensed); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to vibrating agony. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density ("psychic soil") coherent and pattern-taught, propelling to closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scar-reading obsession, plant telepathy, displaced miracle transforms introspection into risky Accumulative CR. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes via shared ivy panic.</comment>
