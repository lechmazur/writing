<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (phantom symphonies in silence) drive concrete micro-choices like tracing the fissure; final filling of her chest with vibration earns transformation without tidy epiphany. Interiority particular via tree "voices" and embodied need.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from single C/G notes to breathing symphony; closure as Charged Poise in "resonant aftermath" reconfigures silence with felt cost of lifelong absence, anchored early without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Porcelain insulator and stress cracks constrain choices (transfer vibration, map resonance) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (texture over sight/sound for deaf sculptor) filters through POV bias, vivid yet economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (summon symphony) tightens via Old One realization, narrowing to release method with agency; cost legible in effortful strums building density, reweighting silence under Accumulative lens, though subtle vs. visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of inherent music in endurance emerges implicitly via tree autobiography; final "world... listening" offers non-literal reweighting of silence-as-presence, resonant without moralizing, tied to particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (trees as orchestra, fissures as score); rhythmic prose modulates from quiet ritual to "thick with harmony," purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short strums amid longer builds); no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (silence as "fabric without thread"); minor figurative density in opener purposeful for tone, propels without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deafness, tree resonance via insulator/cracks transforms eco-fantasy; risk in "empathy in motion" performance heightens stakes organically, inevitable hindsight from phantom harmonies to listening world.</comment>
