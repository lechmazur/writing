<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses (hurt deflection via snail observation) acting simultaneously, earning her final choice to affirm transition. Micro-choices like thumb-stroking the cicada reveal values under pressure. Blind spots in direct confrontation drive her tangential strength, with embodied emotion in bone-settling understanding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build density to RR closure (her realization reconfigures bond as airborne). Orientation anchored immediately in grotto with Kael's words. Pause travels cycles without disorientation, paying off in final line's cadence shift with felt heartache cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto encrusted walls and starlight concretely mirror passage, constraining reflection; snail on moss integrates into pivotal observation beat. Recurrent cicada charges final hand-closure image. Sensory selection (cool stone, damp air) reflects Elara's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Kael's departure) signaled in opening line; accumulative deepening via nature patterns narrows despair option into acceptance. Agency in mental renunciation forecloses proximity with relational cost felt in "heartache... cracking of the shell." One tightening suffices, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transition emerges organically from cicada/snail particulars, not statement; final image ("time changes its song") non-literally answers without moralizing. Subtext in silence fills with truth, reweighting bond diffusely. Resonance inextricable from Elara's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (tidal patterns, fossilized veins) stable in single POV; syntax modulates from descriptive to crystallized poise. Minimal dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("A transition is not an ending"). Rhythmic control heightens pause intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: nature images multi-job (advance theme, embody emotion) sans loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies read-aloud, varying openings; figurative coherence in cycles builds without muddle. Closure line clean, recharging motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: breakup via tidal chronicler's tangential lens transforms trope into inevitable lyric flight. Risky reflection-block integrates as pressure engine. Non-obvious cicada reprise heightens stakes organically.</comment>
