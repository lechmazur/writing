<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias's affectionate skepticism drives contradictory impulses—biting back doubt to paint somatic echoes—earning his wavering at "hairline crack" with visible relational cost. Lena's fierce belief pressures his micro-choices. Flawless embodiment avoids therapy-speak; final intertwining forecloses sterile logic path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: somatic density builds from grief fractal to love spiral, reconfiguring skepticism in Charged Poise closure ("They had found their signal") with emotional cost legible in "hairline crack" and pulse sync. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via matched paintings suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Studio's darkness and LEDs constrain painting choices, charging final geode image; body as micro-setting (sternum frost, solar plexus warmth) mirrors internals purposefully. Sensory hierarchy (lone red light, humming lights) reflects Elias's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminate pathways) signaled early tightens accumulatively: grief match tests skeptic, affection spiral forces reconfiguration under lens. Agency in somatic painting forecloses doubt path; cost felt in "strained" voice and reflected hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wordless language emerges from paintings as "secret coin" and geode reprise, offering non-literal resonant answer ("their own perfect... language") reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in fragile hope layers complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (skeptic ache, light traces as feelings); rhythmic prose modulates from doubt to grace. Minimal dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("Ready?" / "Always."). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density propels: vivid images ("shattering ice," "blossoming spiral") integrate without muddle or loops. Rhythm varies read-aloud; no scaffolds, strong verbs throughout peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathy via somatic light-painting transforms tropes organically; geode and fractals feel inevitable, risking poetic voice that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
