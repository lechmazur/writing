<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pivotal realization of promise as compassion earned via embodied memory layers and needle-handling micro-choice; contradictory guilt/pragmatism acts in scene without tidy resolution. Internal arc confronts flaw (silence) with visible cost in loosened knot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory/memory density tightens to CR closure where promise reconfigures from broken vow to duty, cost legible in "knot finally loosen[s]" and serene forward motion. Orientation anchored early in coach/ferry wait; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring ambient sounds (clank as heartbeat, slosh as breath, hammering punctuation) constrain reflective choice and charge final silence/bell image. Fog/river pressures patient alchemy; sensory hierarchy POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distill promise) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening of memory layers under wait pressure, narrowing to renunciation of literal return; cost felt in unburdened readiness. Agency in attentive endurance forecloses path on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Palimpsest vow emerges organically from needle/river particulars, reweighting failure to compassion; final reins/needle image offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Complexity lingers in river's indifference.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (ambient sounds as vital signs); rhythmic syntax breathes from descriptive density to serene cadence. Elevated diction voice-motivated for coachman's alchemy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythms propels to closure; purposeful metaphors (bubbles in tar, palimpsest) integrate without muddle. Minor density borders overwriting in memory but supports textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of palimpsest promise via ferry alchemy transforms introspection trope; bold lyric risk heightens stakes in fogbound stasis-to-motion shift.</comment>
