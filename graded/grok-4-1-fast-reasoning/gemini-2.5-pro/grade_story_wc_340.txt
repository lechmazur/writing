<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular ("trembling fingers," "breath caught"); contradictory impulses act on-page (feels like intruder yet proceeds to unfold); final affectionate detachment earned by causal chain of discoveries with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelations build density to CR closure ("re-framed her entire existence... quiet, desperate act of love") with legible conceptual cost in heavier diary and reframed memory; one tightening via sketch suffices; orientation anchored immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Goggles as tool constrain decryption choice and charge final image ("words... dissolved back into shimmering, unreadable light"); sensory hierarchy (elevator hum/chimes, polarized hues) reflects POV urgency; spire's glacial shell mirrors internal frost-to-hope shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seek joy beneath anguish) signaled early, tightens via sketch discovery changing knowledge/options; agency in micro-choices (goggles, unfold) under Accumulative lens; cost felt in intruder guilt persisting to charged poise at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of joy-as-promise-alongside-pain emerges organically from particulars (entries, sketch); final image ("held the Captain’s memory with an affectionate detachment") offers resonant non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (inquisitive lens on flickering composure); rhythmic control modulates from lurching ascent to hushed closure; no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, zero loops/artifacts, varied syntax propels (e.g., short chime sentences build urgency); purposeful figures ("iron-clad grief," "sacred text") enhance without muddle; closure image crisp and propulsive.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Goggles-as-decryptor via polarized light offers fresh fantasy synthesis transforming lost-airship trope; quiet CR closure risks bold emotional specificity; irreplaceable ingenuity in vellum sketch pivot.</comment>
