<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied emotion peaks in "ice bloomed in her stomach, spreading outward through her veins," with contradictory impulses (fight paralysis via grounding) acting simultaneously; final endurance earned by somatic buildup and micro-choices like soil under thumbnail. No diagnostic labels flatten crisis; flaws (ongoing menace) complicate without tidy win.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory/memory fragments builds to Charged Poise closure in watering the pine, reconfiguring stance with felt cost of "the sky would always hold a potential for menace." Orientation anchored by arboretum/cliff in first paragraph; single scene causality intact via plane trigger → freeze → grounding cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurring Wollemi pine constrains freeze (hand locked on frond) and charges final image (patient care despite cataclysms); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (pine resin over surf hum). Cliff/arboretum subtly tensions internal storm with geological stability, mirroring theme without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant PTSD-management stake signaled early via coaxing leaf despite frost risks; textural escalation via whine amplification → grounding reversal narrows to endurance, with agency in pearl-search and cost in "joints aching from the sudden tension." Final watering forecloses paralysis path under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of realistic optimism emerges via pine survival paralleling Anya's stasis; final image non-literally answers trauma's menace with "just enough" water, reweighting premise via stubborn life on chasm's edge. No moralizing; resonance from particulars like photo's "ghost against her leg."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (somatic/plant idiom: "slow, deliberate language of growth"); rhythmic modulation peaks in short, fragmented stress sentences ("She had to freeze."). No head-hopping; diction POV-plausible, prose embodies tension via varied syntax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "grit of soil under her thumbnail" advances grounding/action/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds dull peak freeze beat. Zero figurative muddle; read-aloud ear clean through closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Wollemi pine as PTSD counterpoint transforms trauma trope via somatic grounding and fossil optimism; risk in lyric internality pays off without gimmick, heightening stakes through irreplaceable cliff-edge poise.</comment>
