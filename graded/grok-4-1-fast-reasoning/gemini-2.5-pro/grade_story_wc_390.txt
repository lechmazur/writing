<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the climax—"mind held the logical framework... while her body screamed"—earning the final subsumption with embodied cost; logically emotional trait constrains without label-speak dominance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as vibrations densify to shriek then silence; on-page RR closure lands with cost in "slumped against the console, sweat-soaked and trembling"; orientation anchored immediately, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina and tower constrain choices via "hum vibrated up through... boots" and shuddering, charging final quiet image; sensory hierarchy (auditory primacy) reflects engineer's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect Heart) tightens via agency-driven mirroring under accumulative lens, narrowing to shriek; cost unmistakable in molecular protest and post-climax slump foreclosing brute-force path.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of integration over destruction emerges organically through particulars like frequency mirroring; final violet dusk reconfigures "sacred song protected" without moralizing, resonant under textural lens.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in vibrational metaphors ("symphony," "grinding teeth") biases noticing; rhythmic control heightens pressure in climax shriek, stable single POV with no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "tower shuddered in dissonant sympathy"; no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent ("tuning fork," "sonic absolution") even in peak, varied rhythm passes ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sonic premise ingeniously synthesizes physics/faith into vibrational matching climax; transforms guardian trope via fleshly ethereal risks that heighten stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
