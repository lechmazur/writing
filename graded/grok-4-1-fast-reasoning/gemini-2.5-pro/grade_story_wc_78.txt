<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to transform obstacles drives consistent micro-choices like fractal sketching and timed strikes; embodied anxiety as "thrum of anticipation" reveals character without labels. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+ depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from clouds to waves, pattern break via strikes, RR closure in "orchard...humming with the memory," cost legible in "breathing heavily." One tightening suffices; orientation anchored para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Driftwood circle and cedar log constrain strikes and charge final hum; sensory selection narrows crisis to "towering wave" and "thrum." Micro-setting (log node) alters tactics; 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (save orchard via harmony) signaled early, escalates accumulatively to climax strikes narrowing destruction option; agency in "perfect timing" with visible exertion cost. Coheres without reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges via particulars: chaos mapped to resonance, final "made it sing" reweights premise non-literally. No moralizing; orchard hum answers "terrifying forces held a note of beauty."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with musical perceptual signature ("orchestra," "concerto"); rhythm modulates stress without head-hopping. Diction consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful metaphors cohere (e.g., "symphony of creaking wood"). Propulsion peaks at "struck...thrum" without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractals, mallet percussion, and storm-as-soloist transforms survival trope; risk in musical physics pays off at humming aftermath, inevitable in hindsight.</question>
