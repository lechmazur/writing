<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Claustrophobia's contradictory impulses peak at collapse, forcing phase micro-choice with embodied panic; motivation intensifies via grandmother legacy, earning final relief as credible endurance with visible chest-opening cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore chain from entry to phase bypass to insertion DC; orientation anchors in first paragraph (chronometer, relay, tide); closure reconfiguration lands on-page with tide cost and ghost release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cables and fleck constrain navigation/choice (blockage, slot); drip/salt sensory hierarchy narrows under phobia urgency, charging final glow image; facility micro-setting guides all tactics without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tide/phobia dominant stake signaled via chronometer; causal tightening at collapse narrows options, forcing phase agency with panic cost; closure crystallizes stance, foreclosing haunt with openness trade-off legible on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Remembrance theme emerges organically from cable-ghosts and completion act, reweighting unremembered via hush cadence shift; final emptiness answers duty question resonantly without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature vivid in static-prickles and phobia filters; "my grandmother/I remembered" intrusion jars POV stability, risking head-hop despite close-third intent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and integrated sensory action; minor metaphor thickness in opener (leviathans, ghosts) purposeful without muddling peak phase beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh cable-ghosts/phase synthesis transforms haunt trope via fleck logic and codex rules; risk of quantum traversal heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
