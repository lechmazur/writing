<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to decode intentions intensifies through embodied surge of hope/ache/crushing weight; micro-choices like separating silver thread reveal hierarchy of values, but gardener role verges archetypal without deeper flaw complicating peak decoding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echoes/texture builds to CR closure when pattern snaps and case pulses warm, reweighting loss to anticipation with felt emotional cost in "story finally heard"; orientation anchored early, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silo's velveteen gloom and organized workspace constrain decoding choices and evolve from shroud to blanket, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (earth/old cloth/lamplight) filtered through gardener's tender priorities mirrors internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding uncharted intentions signaled early, tightens via coalescing echoes and silver thread reversal that narrows to celestial map under Accumulative lens; agency in tracing/cross-referencing forecloses obsessive path with emotional cost legible in frantic hope's peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-gardening emerges organically from particulars like frayed border/map and case's pulse, culminating in resonant final image of reunited intention/path that reweights premise without moralizing; ambiguity of hope's power lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature of tender precision (e.g., "surgeon’s focus"); rhythmic modulation builds texture under pressure, prose as character in whimsical yet focused diction like "birdsongs after a storm"; no head-hopping or withhold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm supporting Accumulative build; figurative language purposeful and pattern-taught (gloom/blanket evolution), no loops/artifacts dulling closure image of shelf placement/sky tenderness despite occasional purple density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tapestry-border cipher as celestial map transforms ghost-trope into memory-untangling; risk in decoding knots/star-charts feels inevitable from particulars, heightening closure without gimmickry.</comment>
