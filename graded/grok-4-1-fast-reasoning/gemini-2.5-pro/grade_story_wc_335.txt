<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's contradictory fear and belief drive his combative mentoring, shown in backward retreats and tea annotation, earning Elara's final renunciation. Elara's growth from flinch to patient restacking reveals hierarchy of values with cost. Voice distinction in dialogue and perception specificity elevate; no therapy-speak or stock traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of images (knot, cube, tea map, scrolls) tightens to Elara's Earned Stasis closure, reweighting escape as loss with on-page cost in restacking. Single scene oriented early (library, exile context by para 2); no ambiguity. Final vellum push and her kneel land RR with legible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dusty library and playground creak anchor hush; cube constrains risk talk, scrolls tumble to force her choice, charging final image. Sensory filter (scuffing feet, tea dregs) reflects priorities; no white-room. Recurring backward steps mirror internal fracture, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exile return via resilience) signaled early, deepens via tea geometry revealing "key made of loss," forcing Elara's stance crystallization in restacking refusal. Agency in her micro-choice forecloses path with relational cost (staying with Kael). Density cadence shift under lens reweights; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Resilience as unpicking/rebuilding emerges organically from knot, shadow trap, map traps, to scroll restacking—final image non-literally answers "earn way back" with conceptual cost of home-as-here. Subtext in Kael's "roar of belief" charges without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in his retreat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV (Elara focalized, Kael via tells) with perceptual bias (his scars multiply her); dialogue subtextual ("stare or learn") pursues goals. Prose texture poetic yet biased ("combative tenderness"); no head-hopping, rhythm modulates agitation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: "skin a tapestry of fine, silvery scars" integrates image/action; rhythm varies (short snaps in dialogue, flowing traces). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; propulsion peaks in ragged breaths to kneel. Read-aloud ear perfect, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tea-leaf geometry for soul-map transforms exile trope via esoteric precision; backward tell + mirror scars synthesize fresh archivist haunted by failure. Risky combative tenderness heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight in her rebuild repricing his terror.</comment>
