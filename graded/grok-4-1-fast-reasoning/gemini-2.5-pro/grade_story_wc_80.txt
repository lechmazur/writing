<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the dive scene, where stoic calm fractures into frantic embodiment ("lungs began to burn"), earning the final renunciation of loss with scraped knuckles as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds to the inkwell drop/retrieval, landing Charged Poise closure in the hut's final image where purpose reconfigures prior absence with felt triumph's cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pavilion's fissure and rogue current constrain the core choice, charging the final inkwell gleam; sensory hierarchy (ink's iron scent, silt-stirred blackness) filters through Elias's loss-biased POV without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of memory-preservation tightens via drop-induced reversal, narrowing options in the embodied dive; agency forecloses indifference with knuckle-cost legibility charging the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of inkwell as "dark star" offers non-literal resonant answer to witness-loss question, reweighting absence through ritual particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (loss-currents motif) and rhythmic modulation under stress (frantic scrabble to hushed triumph) control pressure; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but minor figurative density in opening ("skeletal hand," "phantom limb") borders overwrite without peak harm; no loops dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ritual of embedding dreams transforms surveyor trope via specific inkwell crisis; fresh synthesis of loss-archivist premise feels inevitable in hindsight's charged poise.</comment>
