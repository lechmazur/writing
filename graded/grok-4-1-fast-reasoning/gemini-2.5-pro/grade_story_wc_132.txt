<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied tension ("knuckles raw and jaw tight") and contradictory impulses (forcing repair vs. pocketing perfect leaf), earning final renunciation of control with felt spinal release. Micro-choices reveal values hierarchy under pressure. No diagnostic slips; flaws (stubbornness) complicate to closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from failed repair to leaf image reconfiguring resistance as futile, yielding Charged Poise CR ("He couldn't put his life back... release control") with legible cost in "no clear blueprint." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via dawn realization suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Environment (wreckage "skeleton of some great beast") and recurring leaf constrain choice and charge final image, filtered through Elias's plant bias. Sensory hierarchy vivid under post-storm mist; tactile handling (plucking leaf) lived-in. Mossy trellis evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve vs. adapt to change) signaled early, tightens via leaf-deepening that forecloses rigid repair with trade-off (sigh releases "coiled tension"). Agency in choosing saw over hammer; cost unmistakable in "betrayal" felt via vine's yield.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reluctant metamorphosis emerges organically from vine/trellis particulars, leaf shifting from miracle to answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Final image ("quiet potential of the ruin") offers resonant non-literal answer to change question. No tidy binaries; ambiguity in "no clear blueprint" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with perceptual signature (plant truths via circuitous speech), rhythmic modulation peaks in realization's quiet dawn. Prose texture distinct; no elision issues. Murmur to lavender clean free indirect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy realizations vs. flowing descriptions), zero loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (vine yielding "sacrificing rigid structure"). Propulsion aligns with emotional cadence; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of midlife crisis via plant behaviors as self-study proxy transforms trope organically. Quiet risk in lyric CR heightens stakes without gimmick; leaf/trellis particulars memorable, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
