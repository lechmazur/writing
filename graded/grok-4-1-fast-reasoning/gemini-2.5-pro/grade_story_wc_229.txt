<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to prove whispers over shouts is embodied through scent memory and bone-thrumming focus, with micro-choices like pressing the cork aligning actions to traits. Interiority concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrases. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak focus beat, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of intent builds to pattern-break ship arrival as Charged Poise RR, with legible cost in "agony of love" threatening to "tear him apart." Single scene oriented instantly; closure image of sunlit sea reconfigures options without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lens and cork as micro-settings constrain the beckoning choice and charge the pocketed reprise in final image. Sensory hierarchy (scent over sight in fog) reflects Elias's priorities; fog/sea evolves causally to vanish.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quiet guidance saves ship) signaled early, escalates texturally via intent density to ship bell toll, narrowing to proof-or-fail. Agency in sustained beckon forecloses horn path with felt emotional cost; captain's echo charges image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet truth piercing storm emerges organically from failed horn vs. scented intent, culminating in captain's garden scent echo as non-literal resonant answer reweighting whispers' power without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in scent/vibration bias; lyrical diction modulates rhythmically with intensity (short sentences in focus peak). Brief captain dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishing voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion; rhythm varies for ear (e.g., stretching minutes). Minor figurative density ("gentle scream") in climax risks overwrite but stays voice-motivated without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh magical-realist synthesis of lighthouse lens purifying intent via personal scent transforms trope into inevitable proof; risk of "vibrations" premise heightens stakes through specific emotional calculus.</comment>
