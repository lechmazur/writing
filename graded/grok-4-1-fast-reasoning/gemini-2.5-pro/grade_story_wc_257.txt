<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in grief concretely shown through workbench micro-choices like folding the crane; internal conflict in recognizing his past in her posture drives quiet agency. Her characterization emerges effectively via reactions, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final shared stance earned with visible cost in lost loved ones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: origami sequence builds density toward closure's Charged Poise in projected constellations, reconfiguring isolation with legible emotional cost ("skin now turned to ash" echoed). Orientation anchored early in observatory; pattern taught by first crane, one tightening via lotus to dais sufficient. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory's "curtains of intention" constrain viewing (parting on hope, shaping her steps) and charge final image; workbench vellum/tools tactile and lived-in, mirroring jeweler's priorities. Sensory selection purposeful (humming silence, obsidian polish). Spatial choreography coherent across wings/dais.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teach her to bloom from shared grief) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via origami progression narrowing emotional isolation; final reveal forces stance crystallization with agency-driven projector choice. Cost felt in vulnerability of opening stencil. One deepening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patterns persisting post-loss emerges from particulars (nebula bloom, binary dance, meteor tears) reweighted in intertwined constellations; final image offers resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in silences and touches avoids tidy resolution, embracing ambiguity of new pattern.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with jeweler-specific perceptual signature (precise folds, metal polish); voice texture modulates from subdued to charged ("quiet light of shared constellations"). Brief dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("patterns"); no head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (slow deliberation to vibrant detail); high density in origami beats advances multiple layers without loops. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("smith hammering soul," "dust of his heart") slightly muddles peak immersion but doesn't touch closure. Clean syntax, no artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Origami-cosmic healing in "genuinely artificial" observatory transforms grief trope via specific stencil progression; fresh synthesis of jewelry craft and stellar guidance feels inevitable. Risky quiet escalation heightens emotional stakes organically.</comment>
