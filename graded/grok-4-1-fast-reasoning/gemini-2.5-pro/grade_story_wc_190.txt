<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to teach silence is vividly embodied in his logical processing of her fear as "dissonance," earning her change with micro-choices like pointing out subtle sounds. Woman's arc shows credible endurance from anxiety to grace, though slightly archetypal without deeper flaws complicating her response.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early orientation (gondola in Aether by para 1) and on-page Charged Poise closure in her "clear eyes" and relaxed breathing, reconfiguring fear to solace with felt emotional cost. Single scene coheres without shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drifting prism terraces and Aether constrain the hush, narrowing perception to auditory subtleties that charge her final grace; storm glass vial as micro-setting enables teaching beat. Sensory hierarchy (silence over visuals) mirrors Elian's priorities without catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (her fear of silence) deepens accumulatively through layered "sounds" (light, hum, sigh), forcing her stance shift with visible cost in unclenching hands and deepened breath. Agency in Elian's monitoring narrows her options from panic to acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as cathedral emerges from particulars like "architecture of the hush," resonating in final image of her graceful step without moralizing; conceptual repricing reweights noise-fear with undeniable peace cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("small, tight knot of sound") modulates rhythmically from hush to her softening voice; sparse dialogue carries subtext of fear-to-comfort, stable Elian POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in lines like "the ghost of the train, the memory of its passage"; rhythmic variety and zero loops/artifacts sustain momentum to closure image, flawless read-aloud ear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferryman-as-silence-guide in prism-world transit transforms Charon trope through textural hush-architecture; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
