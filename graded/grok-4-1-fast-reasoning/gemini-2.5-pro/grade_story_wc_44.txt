<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots in obsessive precision, compelling higher-stakes micro-choices like relearning 'inversion' as 'inside out.' Contradictory impulses act in scene via warped runes versus old texts, earning the final loop closure. Internal voice coherent and particular, with no safety-hedging flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from research to key alignment, culminating in CR closure via projection revealing shadows 'turned inside out.' Orientation anchored early (observatory, post-spoon event). Cost legible in 'obsessive precision' and weeks of study paid in the hum and revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating observatory and automaton constrain choices, with dust-sheeted gears and silk cushion charging tactile precision. Sensory hierarchy scholar-specific: runes over scenery. Final projection on wall mirrors internal stability, evolving causally from activation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (noon shadows) signaled early, tightens via rune relearning and key push, narrowing options under Accumulative lens. Agency in 'practiced slowness' forecloses failure path with felt cost of warped causality effort. Projection reweights knowledge with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of restoring sense via loops emerges organically from rune work to shadow revelation, final image non-literally answering the question. Resonance from particulars like topological knot, no moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from closing the 'frayed tapestry' thread.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: glyphs as 'new grammar,' biased to precision. Rhythmic control modulates from deliberate to held-breath climax. Distinct texture in syntax like 'dust sheeted its intricate gears,' no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., 'pushed it inward, a gesture of completion'); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or artifacts. Figurative purpose-driven ('sugar in hot tea') without muddle in peak projection beat. Propulsion peaks cleanly at 'shadows... turned inside out.'</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-reality-bend fantasy with shadow-inside-out CR, transforming rune tropes via topological key. Risk in conceptual premise heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitable hindsight from early 'loops' to elegant closure.</comment>
