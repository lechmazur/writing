<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior conflict as Lyra's protectiveness clashes with eroding certainty through embodied sensations like "palpable pressure against Lyra's skin"; final choice to lower hand earned by prior causality. Kael remains archetypal without pressure-testing Lyra further. Minor epiphany phrasing ("blinding, terrifying rush") borders unearned but anchors in shadows.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of erratic chords, murky visions, shadowy tableaus builds to CR closure in shadow overlap ("his shadow fell over hers"), reweighting premise with cost ("Her clairvoyance was gone"). Orientation anchored early (cave, Lyra, Kael's arrival). Single scene coherent, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Musical crystals and shadows constrain choices (path of refracted light, merging shadows trigger vision); sensory hierarchy (chimes, pressure, shadows) reflects Lyra's urgency, charging final image. Vivid integration like "humming facets" and "opalescent calcite" evolved causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guard Heartstone) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via failing visions and shadows forcing stance shift; Lyra's agency in interception/renunciation forecloses protection path with cost. Climax shadow merge delivers legible price without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of misunderstood guardianship emerges organically from particulars (shadowy images of "blooming flower, child's laugh"); final image of "sweeter song" resonates non-literally, reweighting Lyra's role without moralizing. Ambiguity in cave's "desire" invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable Lyra-limited POV with perceptual bias (discordant notes as "shivering"); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates intensity, distinct from sparse dialogue. No head-hopping; elision of cave mechanics taught early via chimes, paid in closure pulse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (short eruption sentences in chaos, long in realization). Minor shadow synonym churn ("overlapping shadows," "layered darkness") in mid-beats dulls slightly but doesn't touch closure. No loops, clean syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clairvoyant guardian and sentient cave via shadow communication transforms trope; risk in "bright darkness" tone heightens mystery without gimmick. Heartstone placement as miracle-facilitator feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
