<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction between pride and duty embodied in labyrinth twists mirroring thread insights; final acceptance of "simple, defensive move" earns change with felt cost of "aching relief." Minor reflection integrates via present cues without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of thread analogies builds to RR closure; "platinum labyrinth...snapping into a perfect sphere" delivers legible conceptual cost of truce over triumph. Orientation anchored in opening paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Labyrinth and frayed tapestry border constrain decoding choice and charge final solved-sphere image; selective sensory hush (thunder, petrified stone) filters through chess-tutor bias, evolving causally to rain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of self-forgiveness signaled early, tightens via thread winnowing that narrows to dismissed "cowardly" move; under Accum lens, single deepening reweights with agency in mental isolation, cost felt in "profound acceptance."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as "wisdom to begin the next game" emerges organically from chess/tapestry particulars, final image reconfigures glory-need flaw without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature (moves as threads) with rhythmic control heightens internal pressure; diction modulates from "fierce repose" to "quiet, aching relief" without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels insight beats; no loops, purposeful metaphors (gold thread as bishop’s gambit) cohere without muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess guilt in hush-village frame transforms redemption trope via thread-decoding; labyrinth/tapestry risk heightens closure ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
