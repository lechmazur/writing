<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via trembling hands amid aurora distraction, compelling the imprint; final renunciation of raw pain for bounded silence earned by poured absences with embodied cost. Interiority particular via synesthesia; obsession flaw compounds under time pressure without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from jar-unsealing to forge-thrum to violet-grey glare, yielding CR closure in crystal's silence with legible agony cost ("grinding glass and tearing silk"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks constrain process (salt-streaked glass filters light, moss hums) and charge final image ("skeletal shipwrecks... monuments to survival"). Sensory hierarchy via synesthesia bias; details evolve causally with forge pulse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture trust-break sound before cellular scarring) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density of absences poured under cell-division clock, narrowing to imprint trade-off; agency in final fitting forecloses pain-path with felt agony cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of absence bounding pain emerges via forge process and crystal silence, reweighting shipwrecks from decay to survival in final image without moralizing. Resonance from synesthesia particulars; no tidy binary, ambiguity in "mend" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with synesthetic perceptual signature (aurora's "chaotic lullaby"); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive build to compressed peak thrum. No head-hopping or withholding; diction biased by obsession.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; figurative language purposeful (e.g., "celestial bruise") without muddle in peak imprint. Minor density slip in aurora description but no loops, scaffolds, or closure dulling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, absences-as-material, soul-hearing-aid premise transforms betrayal trope organically; risk in crystalline imprint pays off in reconfigured silence, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
