<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and embodied contradiction culminate in earned renunciation: ink-stained fingers fumbling the clasp reveal struggle, while final chest-weight transformation shows contradictory impulses acting in scene with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly in single continuous scene; orientation anchored by para 1; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) lands cleanly with felt cost in "crushing weight...eased, not gone, but settled" image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (petrichor, dripping, slate chill) filtered through reverent POV constrains gentle choices and charges final blazing bells; recurring wet diamonds evolve to mirror renewal without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (peace with dream) signaled early tightens texturally via coffer-opening deepening to light-struck bells; agency in renunciation forecloses path with legible emotional cost charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of bearing abandoned dreams emerges organically from silence-vs-bells conflict; final ray on bells offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting hush from tomb to foundation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (hush as physical presence/weight); rhythmic prose modulates from glacial density to released cadence, prose-as-character reflecting scribe's ink-stained precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; purposeful figurative layering (ice carves valley, breathing jewel) coherent and pattern-taught, no loops/artifacts; minor overwrites in opening hush motifs don't dull closure blaze.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms monastic silence trope via tiny bells' silent constellation; risk-taking lyric compression heightens stakes organically, though abandoned-dream arc echoes familiar ground with strong particularity.</comment>
