<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds to Charged Poise closure; crystal emergence reconfigures nameless fear with on-page cost in "not healed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dusk light constrains ritual timing and charges final crystal image; selective sensory details (dust motes, soundwaves) mirror internal geography without cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fading rays escalate via textural tightening, forcing agency in prism channeling; cost legible in fractured shard foreclosing oblivion path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atlas-to-crystal progression offers non-literal answer to naming chaos; "scar given form" reweights sacrifice without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Spectral perceptual bias (phantom resonance, spectral fingers) signatures voice; rhythm compresses purposefully at crystallization peak.</comment>
