<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in past-life ache propel micro-choices in the breathing ritual; final emotional reconfiguration feels earned via prior cycles. Minor lack of deeper contradictory impulses slightly limits peak complexity, but spiritual curiosity constraints actions effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through breathing cycles building to Conceptual Repricing closure: "no love is ever truly unused... becomes the light." Orientation anchored early at viaduct; cost legible in transformed ache and tears blurring the view.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (moon-jasmine scent, dewdrop stars) filtered through artist's perceptual bias constrain the focal choice (aiming at cluster) and charge final image of sparks from petals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate unused love) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density in inhale/exhale cycles narrowing to spark vision; agency in ritual yields felt emotional cost at "ache... changing its nature."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of love's transformation emerges organically from jasmine sparks resolving the quest non-literally; final image reweights premise without moralizing, inviting lingering ambiguity on loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (light "behind" images) and rhythmic modulation syncing to breath cycles; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure image without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel through cycles without loops; purposeful figuratives (e.g., "drowned thing") cohere, though minor elevated diction in revelation slightly risks register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera obscura ritual, Kwan Yin quartz, and past-life sparks transforms spiritual tropes into inevitable revelation; risk-taking in breathing mechanics heightens stakes organically.</comment>
