<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's defiance roots in consistent traits, with micro-choices like whispering poetry under pressure revealing values; final poem earns her stance with capture cost. Kael adds pressure without clutter. Minor told phrasing ("innocently mischievous") slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: poetry density builds to echo refraction as CR closure, reweighting hush with her capture as undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early (perch, Ossuary). Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Canyon acoustics constrain poetry tactics and charge final echo symphony; bone towers, mist-clad spire filter through Elara's priorities. Sensory hush "press[es] against her skin" evolves causally. Recurrent spire mirrors defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (refract Absolution truth) signaled early, tightens via horn to final poem agency; lens escalation via cadence shift to fractured echoes forecloses silence with capture price legible in "Wardens' footsteps finally found her."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (forgiveness's silencing price vs. multiplicity) emerges via poems, culminates in non-literal CR: "single truth... lost in a sudden, rising symphony." Particulars like refracted lines reweight premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (hush as "weight heavier than mist"); voice poetic yet controlled, dialogue subtextual (Kael's fear vs. her counter). Rhythm modulates to resonance in final poem.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to closure; minor overwriting in climax metaphors ("needle aimed... shattered") borders muddle but stays voice-motivated and legible. No loops or scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: echo-canyon refracts Absolution premise via poetry physics, transforming silence trope; final "universe of contemplation" feels inevitable from particulars, bold without gimmick.</comment>
