<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak when fingers tighten on knife hilt amid phantom ozone scent, compelling earned renunciation with visible cost of containing heritage. Interiority concrete via plant empathy and embodied rejection of violence. Final micro-choice hierarchy reveals nurturing values over legacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to RR closure in sheathing—"slick, final sound as steel met sheath"—with legible conceptual cost of negated power. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dome's curved panes and glass reflection constrain knife confrontation, charging silhouette image against sunset. Sensory hierarchy (silica dunes softened, cool tiles) mirrors internal resilience via POV bias. Evolving details (ozone phantom vs. quiet) avoid stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nurture vs. violence) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through knife's weight and grip, forcing renunciation agency with on-page cost in "coffin for a future." Coherent pressure culminates in stance crystallization. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of continuity vs. chaos emerges organically via plant inculcation paralleling knife negation; final rose image reweights without moralizing. Subtext in dome's quiet tensions entropy invitation. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "faint tremor of anxiety in a root system." Rhythmic control modulates calm intensity; diction biased toward growing things. No head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors ("sun bled," "tranquil blaze") consistent in poetic pattern without muddle in knife peak. Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in opener but purposeful for tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant-empath pacifism in post-tower wasteland transforms tropes via "senselessly perceptive" gift and sheathing negation. Risky lyric poise heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes.</comment>
