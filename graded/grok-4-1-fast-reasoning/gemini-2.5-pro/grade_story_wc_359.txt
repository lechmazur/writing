<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in "quiet fire against the cold" compels the performance with embodied synesthesia, but lacks shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning declarative. Final lowering of hands earns a meaningful change with felt endurance cost. No safety-hedging flaws complicate choices vividly on page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density swells from tremor cue to song cascade, culminating in Conceptual Repricing where "sculpted hush dissolved" reconfigures world with undeniable cost in prior apathy unmade. Single scene anchored early ("ice cavern"); no orientation debt. Persistent constraint of aurora/cavern shapes tactics to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ice cavern and aurora constrain method and bells, charging final "peaceful" image; synesthetic sensory hierarchy (light tastes, smells) filters via Kael's priorities. Details tactile/lived ("thread of woven sinew") evolve with song. No white-room; micro-setting (bells, fissure) alters performance tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renew wonder vs. hush) signaled early, tightens via density increase in swelling song under Accumulative lens, foreclosing silence with "quiet fire" endurance cost legible at close. Protagonist agency in bell strikes narrows options; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as "essential, beating heart" emerges organically from hush dissolution to "world reawakened," with final rose-gold image offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise. No moralizing; ambiguity in "living stillness" lingers authentically. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with synesthetic perceptual signature ("tone bloomed... tasted of new grass"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in "dance" under pressure. Lyrical diction controlled, biased to colors/senses; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "verdant light that tasted of new grass" advances sensory/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language pattern-taught via synesthesia, coherent without muddle in peak swell.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic bells/aurora unfettering hush transforms mythic tropes via specific prism-song logic; risk in lyric sensory immersion heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars, no derivative hedging.</comment>
