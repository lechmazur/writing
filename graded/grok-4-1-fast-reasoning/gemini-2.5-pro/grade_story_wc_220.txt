<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's ache-driven motivation intensifies through embodied strain in decoding and journey despair; Barrow's reactions force micro-choices revealing her reliance. Contradictory impulses peak at the "despair pricked" fissure moment before earned reconfiguration. Final nurturing realization forecloses loss-path with felt cost of forsaken safety.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: decoding fragments and Barrow's cues build density to CR closure at sapling match, reweighting loss-to-hope with journey cost legible in "relative safety" abandonment. Orientation anchored early in scrapyard. No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint of relics shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Geothermal cavern and phosphorescent fungi constrain entry and charge final image, mirroring internal shift from desolation. Sensory hierarchy (Barrow's smell primacy) reflects priorities; cracked flats pressure travel. Recurring dust/steam evolves causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging chasm) signaled early, tightens via Barrow's directional cues narrowing path amid despair; agency in following leads forecloses alternatives with on-page strain/cost. Accumulative deepening reweights to nurturing under lens; cost unmistakable in two-day exposure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of distance-to-closeness emerges organically from cylinder poetry and leaf-sapling reprise, offering non-literal answer in "single, hopeful seed" without moralizing. Complexity lingers in oblique emotional price; final image recharges prior fragments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in tactile relic-handling and wasteland bias; diction/rhythm modulate from hush to "warm, wild hush." Purposeful compression in journey elision pays off at cavern without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (short despair sentences to expansive cavern). Minor figurative density ("iron bones sing") fits voice without muddle in peak reveal; no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Groove-hidden texts and scent-reading dog synthesize fresh post-apoc riddle; transforms tropes via Barrow's intuitive map to gene-spliced garden promise. Risky quiet CR heightens stakes organically; inevitable in hindsight from relic constraints.</comment>
