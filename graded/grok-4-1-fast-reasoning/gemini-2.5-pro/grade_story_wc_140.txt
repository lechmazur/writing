<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to layer memories into a patchwork soul shows contradictory impulses—erasure as freedom versus yearning for texture—acting in the layering scene, earning the stasis of continued haunting with the felt cost of the shattering horn. Interiority particularized through "grain of a past" and embodied grief as "deep and aching violet." Final endurance forecloses full recovery, scaled perfectly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fragments to coalescence around poison label, delivering Charged Poise closure when ship's horn shatters illusion, reconfiguring options with undeniable cost of receding emotions. Orientation anchored in first paragraph's port containers. Single scene with taught pattern—no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting's acoustics and tides constrain layering, charging final image as walls thin then recede with high tide, mirroring internal states through "slick, green-bearded pylons." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: sounds carry "weight of origins." Micro-object (label) evolves as anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (textured memory) signaled early tightens via woman's violet grief layering over label, forcing agency in curation that peaks with coalescence then costs illusion's shatter. Under Textural lens, cadence shift reweights stake unmistakably in "phantom history" moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of erasure-as-living emerges organically from layering fragments into "patchwork soul," resolved non-literally in final tin-box image repricing freedom's cost without moralizing. Particulars like "softness of newborn’s hand" shift to poison's "desperate choice."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "sounds bend, carrying...weight," modulating rhythm from patient collection to throbbing intensity under pressure. Stable single-POV with compression taught early; overheard snippets natural/subtextual. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer jobs, varying rhythm accelerates to "walls seem to thin" climax without loops or scaffolds. Figurative coherence in "violet of grief...warm gold" purposeful, not muddy; zero artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-trope into textural layering amid containers transforms erasure into "conscious erasure," risking lyric accumulation that heightens stakes via tide constraint; inevitable in hindsight from label anchor to "city of ghosts and goods."</comment>
