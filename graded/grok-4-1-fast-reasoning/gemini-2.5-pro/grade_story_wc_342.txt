<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Face-blind limitation transforms into strength, enabling fractal transcription with embodied touch; motivation rooted in guild duty intensifies credibly under time pressure. Micro-choices reveal values hierarchy in final press despite building groans. Minor slip: internal conflict more implied than simultaneous impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from coin feel to lock transcription to sky veins, culminating in CR closure where finite walls hold infinite cosmos amid demolition cost. On-page cost legible in "building groaned its final protest, but here... heightened stillness." Single scene, no orientation debt, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tree trunk's heartwood and fractal grain constrain choices, charge final image; sensory hierarchy (touch over sight) reflects POV bias. Demolition tremors evolve causally, mirroring internal stakes. "Knot of wood that seemed to draw in the light" anchors spatial coherence and pressures climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sky mirroring) signaled early, tightens via unlocking reversal under Accumulative lens, narrowing to stone press with time cost. Agency in tactile crafting forecloses failure path; groans force endurance. Final sky reweights with conceptual price of impending fall.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in limits emerges organically from fractal pattern, artist's flaw, finite tree vs. infinite sky. Final image reconfigures premise non-literally, but explicit "Discovering limits... boundaries" line borders echo, slightly undercutting pure emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable, perceptual signature touch/fractal-biased; rhythm modulates from deliberate dance to "soft sigh... cerulean light." Diction purposeful, compression taught early in coin chaos. No head-hopping, voice embodies face-blind intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels without loops; figurative veins "fractally precise" coherent, not muddled. "Fingertips... danced over the lock" shows via image. No scaffolds, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: face-blind fractal unlocking sky in doomed tree library feels inevitable from particulars. Bold risk in touch-map premise transforms trope of hidden knowledge. No derivative echoes, closure ingenuity heightens conceptual stakes.</comment>
