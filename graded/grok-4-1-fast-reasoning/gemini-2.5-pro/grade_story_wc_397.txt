<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete embodiment like "grips reality loosely" and patience as "taut, humming wire"; contradictory impulses in selfish trawling versus saintly vest peak in closure realization, fully earned with visible cost of using others' loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; orientation anchored in first paragraph; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in ice's "sighing crackle" with conceptual cost of dignified severance reconfiguring her premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via fractured pier positioning her for the groan "vibrat[ing] up through the soles of her boots," charging final image where wind affirms calm; sensory hierarchy (sound/touch over visual) mirrors muted-world POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake to learn ending's sound tightens texturally via debris density to ice calve reversal, forcing endurance with felt cost of selfish method; minor abstractness in internal stakes slightly mutes visceral punch before closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of release without fight emerges organically from debris "clipped-off sentences" and ice "letting go," with final image offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting beginnings (parasol) against endings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in sound-texture focus ("resonant sigh of release"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in groan build without filter excess or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax in peak ("prolonged, sighing crackle, a thousand crystalline heartbeats"); minor figurative density in patience metaphors purposeful and pattern-taught, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourist trawling disaster for death's "sound" via ice calve, transforming tropes through parasol contrast and windborne release; risk in lyric texture heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
