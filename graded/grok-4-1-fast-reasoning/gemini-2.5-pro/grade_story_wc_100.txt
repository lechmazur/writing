<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's weariness and psychic burden embodied in "constant, psychic static that frayed the edges of his world"; stubborn resolve compels space-folding and lens insertion with felt cost of pressure endured. Final silence as earned stasis forecloses noisy existence. Minor backstory summary slightly abstracts early motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of signals builds to astrolabe activation as Resonant Reconfiguration, reweighting chaos into resolved history with cost in "weariness settling into a gentle, welcome calm." Orientation anchored in opening lines; shards (pier/library) taught early, closure legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Basalt shelves and coral astrolabe constrain choices, charge final hum; sensory hierarchy (pressure as "silent screams," lens warmth) filters via Elias's haunted perception. Micro-setting (lens shard) shapes climax insertion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end psychic noise) signaled early, escalates via lens-focusing and space-occupation to astrolabe payoff under Accumulative lens; agency in "fitted the fractured crystal" forecloses chaos with legible relief cost. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of noise-to-stillness emerges from lens-net weaving "threads of panic...into tranquil history"; final image reconfigures pursuit without moralizing, resonant via particulars. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature ("map made of pressure and longing"); diction/rhythm modulate from discordant hum to profound silence, heightening pressure. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, propulsion in "water parting...as a tear in reality"; rhythmic variety, zero loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (e.g., "ink made of moonlight"). Climax vivid without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychic undertaker, lens-key to spirit library; space-folding and signal-weaving transform tropes organically. Risky underwater mausoleum charges stakes inevitably.</comment>
