<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's isolation as blind spot enables ritualistic method, shown in disc taps and word loops driving caller's shift; earned endurance with absolute vacuum cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dialogue density tightens to man's reconfiguration; Charged Poise closure via affirmed silence-as-sound, Silas's isolation as cost legible in final alcove quiet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel's damp ozone and cable hum constrain ritual quiet, disc as micro-setting punctuates pauses; final train pulse charges isolation image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to rewire ending signaled early, deepens via looped deepening forcing semantic pivot; isolation cost felt as man strengthens, Silas unchanged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Looping recontextualizes finality as opening without moralizing; final "pause" image resonantly answers endings-beginnings question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with semantic perceptual signature; dialogue subtext advances via echoes, rhythmic modulation in interaction beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels without loops; purposeful repetition in "faint ringing" supports textural build to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Semantic engineering premise synthesizes antique tech and therapy into fresh loop; risk in absolute isolation heightens closure coherence.</comment>
