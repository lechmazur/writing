<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to find meaning in margins roots actions consistently with embodied details like kneeling on concrete; interiority particular via "quiet hum beneath his skin." Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from clipboard data to chalk codes to envelope; Charged Poise closure in final lines reconfigures stakes via "slow, uncertain journey through... blind spots" with legible conceptual cost of analog defiance. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Arcade's "high glass ceiling" and plaza concrete constrain chalk action and charge final return to "Gilded Gryphon’s golden glow"; sensory hierarchy (holographic ghosts, sanitation drone hum) selective via Kaelen's analog bias. Micro-setting tools like chalk evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of analog identity transmission signaled early tightens accumulatively via chalk deception layering to letter; agency in "layered deception" forecloses digital paths with cost of "fragile timeframe." One meaningful deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of analog margins vs. digital sterility emerges organically from chalk "smokescreen" and envelope relic; final image of "tangible piece of hope" offers resonant non-literal repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with perceptual signature on fabrication ("weave a lifeline using... discarded threads"); rhythmic control modulates build to peak compression in sealing envelope. No head-hopping; diction character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; figurative language purposeful for tone without muddle in closure ("breath held before a letter is mailed"). Minor overwriting in opening metaphors but no loops or scaffolds dulling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of futuristic chalk codes and surface mail transforms pseudonym trope; risk in analog defiance heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via layered particulars.</comment>
