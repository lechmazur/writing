<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through atonement driving daily ritual, embodied in reverent satchel-opening; interiority concrete via bird-language translation. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9; endurance earned but no raw internal friction in pivotal planting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from satchel reveal to guided planting, culminating in Charged Poise closure—"dozens of small, deliberate patches... a narrow line of hope against the vast and silent dark"—with felt cost (aching back, lighter satchel). Orientation anchored early (jetty, post-reef); one tightening via gull directions suffices. Lens taught implicitly, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Jetty's fissures and blooms constrain choices ("shallow basin," "sweet silt pocket"), charging final image of soil patches; sensory hierarchy (perfume vs. silence) reflects POV priorities. Twilight evolution mirrors renewal; no white-room, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (garden reclaiming battlefield) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via bird-guided tightenings narrowing seed placements; agency in micro-choices forecloses inaction with cost (physical ache, partial renewal). Entry to 8+ via trade-off, but no deeper reversal beyond density keeps from 9.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of submerged concord emerges organically through planting as translation, resonant in final image reweighting loss into "hope against the... dark" without moralizing. Particulars (seed library, gull cries) shift meaning; no tidy resolution, ambiguity lingers in partial victory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (dead languages in gull calls); rhythmic control modulates from descriptive to propulsive in planting sequence. Lyrical diction purposeful, no head-hopping or filter excess; voice as character in "quiet atonement."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short cries vs. long sentences); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors despite lyricism—figuratives integrate (e.g., "stone finger," "garden on a gravestone"). Minor overwriting in opening jetty description nudges below 9; propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: seed-planting atonement via bird-oracles on dead-sea jetty transforms eco-tropes through "submerged concord"; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight. No derivatives, bold voice commits fully.</comment>
