<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Albino tracker's serene anger embodied in chalk-pale skin pain and gut-settling rage compels micro-choices like ignoring kin shouts; motivation to solve time-slowing mystery roots in rockslide crisis memory, earning disappearance act with holy rage cost. Contradictory impulses in calm breath amid drone whine act simultaneously. Minor stock phrasing like "predator's fluid grace" slightly genericizes but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: eclipse/drone/rockslide therefore ink pursuit/disappearance DC, with erasure cost legible in "written out of existence" and drone's confusion. Single scene, orientation anchored in first paragraph (encampment, eclipse end, Kael). No orientation debt; closure reconfigures pursuit options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wind-carved sandstone basin constrains ink canvas choice, charging final pattern step; eclipse light as "blade's sharp edge" pain mirrors internal rage. Sensory hierarchy via tracker's bias: whirring drone irritates silence, ink fractals seen geometrically. Recurring stone/rock evolves from slide to canvas without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hunt drone for time mystery) tightens causally when drone whines closer, forcing step into pattern; agency in pouring/reading ink forecloses staying, with erasure cost felt in drone's futile sweep. One reversal suffices; pressure coheres to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Wild vs. machine theme emerges organically from ink fractals drinking Kael vs. drone blasphemy, reweighted in final "hunt the ghost in the machine" CR with conceptual wild-cost. No moralizing; resonance from particulars like quantum thread pursuit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with tracker's perceptual signature: reads "impossible geometry" like broken twig; rhythmic diction modulates from descriptive to compressed in ink-step climax. Elevated lyricism voice-motivated, no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: ink "branched into fractal lattices, forming and dissolving" does triple duty (action, setting, closure image); rhythm varies (long descriptive to short "He did not fade"); no loops, coherent metaphors, propulsion peaks at "stepped into the heart."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wild magic ink vs. tech drone tracking transforms tropes via ephemeral patterns gateway; risk in non-teleport "written out" disappearance inevitable from established tracker logic, heightening wild-machine stakes.</comment>
