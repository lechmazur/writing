<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied rawness ("sandpaper against his nerves") driving micro-choices like methodical search; contradictory impulses peak in accordion wheeze acknowledging guilt without erasing it, earning final renunciation with visible cost of leaving it behind.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to graffiti epiphany as CR, reweighting map-quest premise with cost in accordion's exhausted sigh and abandonment; orientation anchored early ("followed the river’s memory"), no lens ambiguity, closure cost legible in "leaving the weight... behind."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (ivy shroud, damp earth, cracked tiles) filter through Elias's grief-biased perception, constraining search and charging final image; station micro-setting guides choices via "groaning main doors" to stall graffiti.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness via map) signaled early, deepens at graffiti to Charged Poise reconfiguration narrowing options from conquest to agency; cost unmistakable in accordion left on "dusty bench," altering post-quest flow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of agency over pain emerges organically from map pursuit to graffiti ("YOU ARE THE ONE WHO DRAWS THE LINES") and accordion sighs; final image offers non-literal resonance reweighting guilt as "tributary," not destination, with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in geographic/grief-filtered noticing ("chronicle written in silt and stone"); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure at wheeze, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful figures ("broken lung") integrated into action; minor figurative density in opening ("sandpaper... rawness") without obscuring closure, no loops or scaffolds dulling wheeze beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-map quest resolved via graffiti wisdom and taped accordion abandonment transforms trope; risk in raw, unhealed orientation ("not healed, but oriented") heightens stakes organically.</comment>
