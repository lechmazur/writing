<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular to machinist's worldview (pressure/release) drives micro-choices like adhesive analysis; contradictory impulses (logic vs. chaotic memory) act in scene, earning final reconfiguration with emotional cost in trembling hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered discoveries (adhesive → pollen → chain → letters) tightening to on-page CR; closure reconfigures premise with conceptual cost ("Duty and love were not conflicting values"), anchored early without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains path (crater tiers, center stone) and charges final image (regulators gleaming); sensory details (thermal breaths, geologic sighs) filter through POV, evolving with dawn light to mirror realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonize values/understand silence) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through clue chain narrowing options; agency in puzzle-solving forecloses misbelief with felt cost ("truth settled over him, vast and quiet").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of encoded love emerges from particulars (adhesive map, unsent letters), final image offers resonant CR ("two parts of the same complex, vital machine") reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with machinist perceptual signature (groans of metal/rock); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, prose-as-character reflects analytical mind without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "geologic sighs"); varied rhythm propels without loops, though minor density in opening risks slight overwriting under lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forensic analysis (pollen/azurite in glue) and cipher chain transforms inheritance trope; risk-taking in volcano machinist frame heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
