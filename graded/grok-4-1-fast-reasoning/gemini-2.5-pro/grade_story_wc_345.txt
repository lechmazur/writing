<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Characters defined by consistent traits—Elara's fragile faith vs. Kaelen's cynicism—drive micro-choices like following messages despite doubt, earning the collective climb. Group as found family coheres pressure without headcount blur. Shallow interior contradiction limits depth; no embodied emotional layering in pivotal climb.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: messages trigger reexamine → cell → bell → diagram → resonance DC, with clear before/after as magnetosphere clears. Mosaic shards taught early via dawn messages, transitions legible. Climb cost felt in "symphony of desperation"; final "Go home" Charged Poise reconfigures path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating arches constrain impossible climb, dust "rust and regret" charges atmosphere and evolves to shake free at resonance. Biodome figs mirror "brambled hope," filtering through survivors' priorities. Sensory hierarchy vivid, purposeful; arches reweight final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape via stable path) signaled early, tightens causally through message escalations to group climb forcing trade-off (effort vs. doubt). Agency in rigging pulleys, hoisting Anya; wind as complication. Cost legible in "treacherous winds," resonance forecloses magnetosphere barrier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of selfless guidance amid brambled hope emerges via chalk messages → collective success, final smile reweighting "lonely guardian." Subtext in bell's seized silence → resonance avoids moralizing. Complexity in trust's risk pays off without tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person with Elara focal bias; perceptual signature in "faith a fragile shield." Dialogue sparse, natural/subtextual ("What good is this?"). Rhythm modulates crisis (short climb sentences); no head-hopping despite group.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak resonance beat. Propulsion peaks at "low, harmonic hum pulsed," weaving sensory/action seamlessly. Opening anchors voice/stakes cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bell as tuning fork for planet's arches transforms ghost trope organically via chalk causality. Fresh synthesis of survival puzzle with benevolent AI-echo; risk in mosaic shards heightens collective stakes without gimmick.</comment>
