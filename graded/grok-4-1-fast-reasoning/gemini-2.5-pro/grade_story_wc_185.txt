<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation intensifies credibly from charting to singular ritual under sonic pressure, with embodied strain in "old bones protesting" and "fortress of will"; micro-choices like extracting ice reveal values; lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in climax for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from hum to ice pattern to hush bloom; on-page RR closure as hum inverts into quiet with cave shudder cost; orientation anchored early in caves; single tightening via internalized map suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens to sonic edges and ice fractures filtering through mapkeeper bias; caves constrain via Chamber of First Frost access; recurring stone light charges final steady pulse image; no white-room, all purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quiet amid storm) signaled early, escalates via sharpening hum and flare intensification under accum lens; agency in conjuring forecloses noise option with felt shudder cost; one decisive deepening at pattern release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of silence as active void emerges organically from ritual particulars, not statement; final "rich, textured presence of peace" reweights noise premise non-literally; no moralizing, ambiguity in "not banished the storm, but... eye."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third with perceptual sonic signature ("noise that had angles"); rhythmic modulation accelerates to climax hush; no head-hopping or withholding; diction controlled, prose as strained mind under din.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/imagery without loops; rhythm varies with pressure, varying openers; minor figurative density ("grinding hum... angles") in opening risks overwrite but pattern-taught and purposeful, no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ice-crack cartography and hush inversion transforms sci-fant trope organically; risk in sonic/textural ritual heightens stakes; final eye-of-storm reconfiguration inevitable from particulars.</comment>
