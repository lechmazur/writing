<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the climax—"Instinct shrieked at me to abort... But flight was failure"—earning the final endurance with embodied cost of phantom agony and oxygen depletion. Interiority concrete and particular, with degradation under stress; no diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density surges as "the hush... lunged," culminating in Charged Poise RR where vial seals with death's cost legible in "power reserves flatlined." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Suit chronometer and oxygen alarm constrain climax choices; obsidian altar and vial charge final image of "pearlescent glow" against "liquid midnight." Sensory hierarchy narrows to tactile/psychic immediacies under crisis, integrated via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake signaled early (capture hush); accumulative escalation deepens via memory maelstrom forcing "override instinct," with agency in isolating priestess thread; cost unmistakable in ragged breath and flatlining reserves charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral as companion emerges via priestess memory shift—"serene acceptance"—reweighting mission without statement; final vial-to-chest image offers non-literal resonance, inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in psychic-sensory blend ("cold stone under a priest’s bare feet"); rhythm modulates tightly under stress, with compression in climax; stable first-person focalization biases toward mission priorities.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines like "The hush did not flow in; it lunged" advance sensation and stakes; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures; varied rhythm breathes with pressure, zero artifacts in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychic residue in drowned temple transforms tropes via vial's memory-touch; risk in fatal success heightens stakes, with priestess thread inevitable from hush logic; no derivatives.</comment>
