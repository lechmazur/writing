<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Helix-minded traits drive concrete micro-choices like riding recursive currents amid the memory tide; internal conflict embodied in throbs and fragmentation threat peaks at "tide of sorrow...pull her under," earning the final integration with visible identity cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from gel application to "silence...new chamber opening"; closure as RR (Charged Poise) lands cleanly in final integration image with legible cost ("throb...hammer blow forging"), oriented early via canyon/workshop anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting of periscope mirror constrains dive and charges closure reflection; canyon hum/whisper, ozone/lavender gel integrate tactilely into action, mirroring internal maelstrom without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrate dream sans self-loss) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via "dove into torrent...fought back" forcing will-focus; cost unmistakable in "head throbbed...pulse a hammer blow," charging final stabilization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging chaos amid erasure emerges organically from dream flashes to sunset symphony internalized; final tear/smile image reweights premise without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of self-enrichment's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with helix perceptual signature ("spiraling connections," "recursive currents"); rhythmic modulation peaks in dive ("storm of ghosts") then silences purposefully, diction biased to engineer's precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative stack in climax ("maestro...torrent...tide...hammer blow") borders overwrite, slightly muddling peak propulsion without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neural archeology via broken mirror/periscope twist transforms memory trope; risk in mind-modification paradox heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via helix logic.</comment>
