<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via bone-felt hum and fragmentary images like "glint of a monocle"; final realization as "destination" earned with emotional cost. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via crank's building rhythm to flood of understanding; CR closure legible in "peace...paid for with the weight of a crown," with undeniable emotional cost in final sigh and lightness.</comment>
