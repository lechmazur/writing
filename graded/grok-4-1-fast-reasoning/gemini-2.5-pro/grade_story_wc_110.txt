<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and micro-choices like leaving the desk for the first time reveal Elias's yearning and risk; contradictory spying impulse vs. transparency desire acts in scene. Final confession earned by ticket accumulation. Minor epiphany summary ("doodles were no longer cryptic") borders on unearned insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ticket rituals build density to park shard's Charged Poise closure. Lens offering as DC/RR reconfiguration legible with relational cost ("delicate thaw"). Orientation anchored early; two-shard scope fits defaults seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (wet earth/jasmine, glistening pathways) mirror internal states and guide soft approach on gravel. Recurring "crystal whispering forecourt" motif charges final image, constraining emotional revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thaw mistrust) signaled early via silence ritual; accumulation deepens via ticket pattern to agency-driven eavesdropping/following, narrowing to confrontation choice. Cost felt in spying confession and partial thaw; one tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silent honesty emerges organically from doodles/grief symbols, reweighted in final shared stand without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in tear-caught moonlight recharges prior motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with Elias-specific perceptual bias (silence as "fortress/currency"). Rhythmic prose modulates hush to charged hush; purposeful compression taught early, pays off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image integration; read-aloud ear strong. Minor overwriting in stacked figures ("dense, ringing silence"; "crystal whispering expanse" echo) slightly muddles peak lobby beat without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cryptic doodles ingeniously transform silence trope into puzzle driving turns; ticket-key motif fresh synthesis risking symbolic overload but succeeding via concrete payoff. Non-obvious spying-to-empathy arc feels inevitable.</comment>
