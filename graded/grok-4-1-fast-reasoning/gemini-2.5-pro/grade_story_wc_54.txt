<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shines in embodied curiosity ("quiet hum of curiosity vibrated through her") and micro-choices like daisy-chaining generators, earning her final realization with visible effort cost; contradictory rational disappointment before success acts in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly from sextant discovery to power rigging to slot insertion ("quiet click") and activation; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with cost in her three-hour labor and foreclosed doubt, reconfiguring hope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Abandoned terminal's decay (ozone/popcorn, confetti drifts) supplies carnival generators constraining her tactics; gantry climb and panel slot charge the climax image, with sensory hierarchy via her engineering lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlocking hidden purpose tightens via rigging reversal (generators groan, momentary failure) forcing endurance; agency in switch throw narrows options with felt risk of inertness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hope as "circuit waiting to be completed" emerges organically from rerouted power to star chart bloom, offering resonant non-literal answer in final galactic image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (equations, frequencies, nodal coordinates); rhythmic control modulates from analytical precision to wonder in closing lines.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("cables went taut"); varied syntax and no loops, though minor figurative density ("living star chart") in peak avoids muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of spaceport decay, carnival detritus, and brass key unlocking galactic view transforms tropes into fresh monument-to-destination premise.</comment>
