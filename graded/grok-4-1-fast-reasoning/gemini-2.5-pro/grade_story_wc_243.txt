<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve small moments drives consistent micro-choices like steeping the photo, culminating in her instinctive journey to the jetty; interiority embodied in stained fingers and shivering energy. Minor flaw: epiphany at recognition ("instinct that defied logic") borders unearned without stronger contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid Causal-Accumulative lens holds: restoration causally links to jetty convergence, accumulating textural density to Charged Poise closure where shared locket reconfigures feud with legible cost ("haunted by the ghosts of generations who had lived and died by a lie"). Orientation anchored early; two-shard structure seamless; cost undeniable in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Blooming jetty at twilight charges final image, constraining convergence and mirroring internal revelation; sensory details (salt-scrubbed wood, phosphorescent buds) filtered through archivist's tactile priorities, vivid and purposeful. Environment guides choice from archive to pier without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth to heal rift) signaled via locket, tightens through restoration revelation narrowing options to jetty journey; convergence forces stance crystallization with generational cost felt in Tomas's line and final haunted euphoria. Agency in Elara's actions drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of regenerated covenants emerges organically from photo restoration to blooming jetty, final image offering resonant non-literal answer reweighting feud as "pointless animosity" without moralizing. Subtext in clasped hands vs. rivals charges irony; complexity in "tragic" loss lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with archivist's perceptual signature (aging paper, chemical brews); elevated diction consistent and voice-motivated, modulating rhythmically. Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("It was never about fishing rights"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but overwriting via stacked figuratives ("chemical covenant", "hours bled into a soft, bruised evening") in restoration beat muddles slightly without pattern payoff; minor coherence slip in mixed vehicles like "whisper in a room of shouts". Closure image clean; no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of archival restoration triggering miraculous blooming heals feud, transforming preservation trope via proximate causes chain; fresh inflection in locket's blur-to-love reveal growing from particulars, risk-taking in supernatural jetty payoff heightens stakes organically.</comment>
