<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Julian's motivation as encore-seeking ghost is vividly embodied through synesthetic traits and consistent drive to alter Elara's despair; micro-choices like layering echoes reveal values. Minor slip: lacks overt internal contradiction, with competence dominating over struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density buildup to RR closure—Elara pockets coin without flipping, despair shattered with Julian's energy cost felt in "poured all of his spectral energy." Orientation anchors early; one tightening via applause surge suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Chronos Tree and Moon-Blossoms recur to constrain and charge closure—bud nudged as final bow reconfigures maze's magic. Sensory details (silver-honey scent, rust color) filter through Julian's bias, purposeful without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert tragedy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through echo layers narrowing Elara's despair options; applause vibration forces stance crystallization with bone-felt cost. Agency clear in Julian's pours; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of nostalgia redeeming despair emerges organically via echoes reweighting tarot coin's ruin/star; final pearlescent blossom offers resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing; ambiguity in "choice made irrelevant by a feeling" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("colors, chords of sensation") biases noticing distinctively; POV stable in ghost's textured voice, modulating rhythm with intensity—no head-hopping. Compression of echoes taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (short gasp sentences peak); no loops or scaffolds, metaphors coherent ("sour rust thins"). Minor figurative density in echoes beat doesn't obscure; clean propulsion to bud sigh.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synesthetic ghost weaving timeline echoes transforms spectral trope organically; fresh premise of "conductor of memories" risks bold POV, heightens stakes inevitability in hindsight via encore arc.</comment>
