<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shines in embodied contradiction—arms carving cipher paths during dance reveal logic vs. intuition struggle. Final roll earns change via prior dance insight, foreclosing control with vulnerability cost. No unearned epiphanies; micro-choices like journaling her poem hierarchize values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from journal opacity to dance insight, cadence shifts at dice roll for RR closure. Cost legible in "surrendered variable" realization reconfiguring options. Orientation anchored early; single scene tightens meaningfully without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sunken lab's hum and algae constrain isolation, charge final chord shift and fractal bloom. Sensory hierarchy (pressure dirge, bone coolness) filters through Elara's code-symphony bias. Micro-setting (desk, tanks) guides dance-to-desk progression purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate mother) signaled early, deepens via dance reversal narrowing logic-only tactics. Agency in poem-writing/roll forecloses control path with felt surrender cost under accumulative lens. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (vulnerability strengths logic) emerges from dance defiance and dice surrender, final fractal reweights chance vs. control without moral. Dice motif shifts from relic to key, charging closure organically. Ambiguity lingers in "shared soul made whole."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: code as "symphony," cipher as "spiraling paths." Lyrical rhythm modulates from dirge to chord, diction purposeful (lyrical code). No elision or head-hopping; voice biases notice symbols/dance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short leaps amid arcs), density high with multi-job lines like "arms carved arcs... variable substitution." Minor metaphor pile in opening but coherent, no loops or scaffolds dulling roll/closure. Propulsion peaks at "tumbled, clicking softly."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dance-decrypting in logic-purist lab transforms code-breaking trope via chance dice. Risky lyric mode (web-spinning patience to defiant leap) heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight. No derivatives; bold defiance of control feels singular.</comment>
