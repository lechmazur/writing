<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—analytical certainty vs. intuitive pattern-following—act simultaneously from mica discovery to balcony, earning final understanding without full conversion; embodied in "absurd, a refutation of her life's work."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as symbol discoveries densify into intuitive grace and CR closure; cost legible in "clover melancholy" reconfigured to "quiet peace of an equation...resolved" on balcony; shards legible with mica as taught pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mica pane as micro-setting constrains all choices from library etchings to final glow, charging closure image; subway "grimy, forgotten corners" filter through prof's pattern bias, evolve to rail yard rust.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping father's soul via symbols) signaled in note, tightens via weeks' deepening from skepticism to grace under Accumulative lens; cost in foreclosed "stultifying certainty of zero" felt at "beautiful risk" etching.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of patterns in chaos emerges implicitly via glyph path to "lucid contradictions"; final lantern lighting non-literally reweights logic's limits with resonant ambiguity, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of probabilistic grace in "impossibly fine, cryptic scrawls"; rhythmic diction modulates from melancholy to peace, prose texture distinct and pressure-attuned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; specific verbs/nouns propel from "brushed it away" to "flickered, casting...shadow"; figurative "lucid contradictions" purposeful, not muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of subway glyphs as "city’s soul" map transforms gambler inheritance trope; risk-taking in mosaic shards heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via mica key.</comment>
