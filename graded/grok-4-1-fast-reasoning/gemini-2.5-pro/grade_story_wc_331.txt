<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, compelling meticulous ritual; embodied emotion peaks in "tremor in his hands" post-vision with credible endurance cost. Minor slip: no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during setup, reducing tension in solitary execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to vision; Charged Poise closure lands on-page via "proven the path" and tremor cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like specific tomes (celestial mechanics, Lobachevsky) constrain ritual choices; library manifold perception filters through POV. Patrons' subtle reactions mirror internal state, charging final desk return.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (access story-place) signaled early, escalates via textural density to vision then fade; agency in scarf draping tightens under lens. Cost legible in dissolving image and tremor foreclosing capture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of story-reality boundary emerges organically from ritual particulars; final smile reconfigures patience motif with resonant ambiguity. No moralizing, counter-readings linger in "universe of secrets."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with geometric perceptual signature ("manifold, geodesic path"); rhythmic diction modulates from calm to "low thrum" intensity. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors consistent ("saddle-shaped space") without muddle in vision beat. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear in sequential actions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry, sci-po library, and analog scarf transforms "magical ritual" trope into rigorous conceptual pursuit. Risky premise commits fully, inevitable in hindsight via vision payoff.</comment>
