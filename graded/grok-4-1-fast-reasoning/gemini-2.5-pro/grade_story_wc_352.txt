<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prism-mind trait drives pivotal wall revelation through refraction, earning final burden with embodied panic overridden by practiced grace; micro-choices like aligning doodle with fungi reveal values hierarchy. Minor flaw: initial purpose telling slightly abstracts motivation before full dramatization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: Inversion enables entry, doodle guides to wall, alignment unlocks equation, groan forces memorization/escape with legible cost in hard landing and eternal burden. Continuous scene, orientation anchored in first paragraph, CR closure reconfigures knowledge with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inverted stalactites/stalagmites and upward-falling water constrain movement, forcing floating grace; phosphorescent fungi charge wall revelation by enabling alignment. Sensory details (gut-lurch, shimmering equation) filter through prism-mind bias, evolving causally with gravity shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secure combination vs. lethal Inversion/plague) tightens via wall impasse to perspective shift, narrowing options under causal lens; agency in alignment/escape forecloses easy paths with scramble cost and felt responsibility charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of vigilance-through-synthesis emerges organically via scattered ideas' potency, reweighted in memorized equation and "internal fire now his to guard" without moralizing; final image offers resonant CR on knowledge's dual promise/threat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (refracting doodle into "interwoven pathways"); rhythm modulates from quiet tracing to tense scramble, diction purposeful without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: lines multi-task (e.g., "water droplets... silver pearls" builds inversion rules via image); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds, though minor "clandestineyl" typo and occasional elevated diction nudge below peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gravity-inversion physics and doodle-as-perspective-key synthesize fresh quest frame, transforming knowledge tropes via prism-mind; wall revelation feels inevitable from early cues, bold world logic cued without retreat.</comment>
