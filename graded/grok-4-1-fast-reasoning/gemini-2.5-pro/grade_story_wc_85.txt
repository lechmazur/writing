<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied guilt ("acidic burn of his tempered regret") driving micro-choices like the shore search; final renunciation of black-market life earned by revelation, with contradictory pride-curse impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: past work causes search (driftwood method), discovery causes truth revelation, reconfiguration to restoration purpose; CR closure legible in "forcing the world to remember" with lingering guilt cost on final line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Driftwood and gouged oak constrain pivotal discovery choice and charge final image alongside watch hand; sensory hierarchy (hush, waves "like sandpaper on bone") mirrors psychic void under Elias's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unveil truth) tightens via wood-touch reversal changing knowledge from death to erasure; agency in sifting forces stance crystallization to restoration, with horror/guilt cost felt in stagger back.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory weapon vs restoration emerges organically from particulars (gouge as "structured absence"); final image reweights premise non-literally as "sift the truth back," embracing ambiguity of partial recovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (psychic resonance in objects); rhythmic control heightens pressure in "world tilted" reveal, diction biased to haunted textures without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density (e.g., "sieved hush" motif propels without repetition); varied rhythm accelerates to gouge-touch climax, figuratives coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-trafficking premise with driftwood psychometry transforms erasure trope; risk in quiet CR closure heightens stakes via irreplaceable void-image inevitability.</comment>
