<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Guarded druid's contradictory impulses—ignoring ghosts while pushing deeper—act in scene, earning the climax's wall-cracking and heart-unbending with embodied life-force cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual circles densify pressure to center; on-page CR closure via "I wasn't strong enough" revelation and seed-planting reconfigures past with emotional cost legible in final weeping.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid micro-setting (petrified soil, blanched reeds, bone-pale bark) constrains ritual choices through expanding circles; twisted trees recur to charge final branch-unbending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth in vortex) escalates via agency-driven circles under Accumulative lens, narrowing to life-force pour at "pushed... groaning with... torment"; unmistakable cost forecloses guarded stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of inadequacy's truth vs. mirrors' limits emerges implicitly through confession voice and seed-planting; final image offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (serenity as "blade cutting... noise"); diction/rhythm modulates intensity purposefully in ritual without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels circles to climax; coherent metaphors (serenity "blade," "fortress walls") avoid muddle, though minor descriptive density edges overwrite in opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of druidic ritual mechanics (circles, seed vs. curse) transforms tropes; unbending branch as nexus feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
