<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority via tactile instincts and embodied tension (cold knuckles, humming vibration); final renunciation of doubt earned through box revelation, with contradictory faith impulses resolving in serene acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from failed grapples to box surfacing; CR closure lands cleanly in sundial insight ("you could understand its function... without needing the sun"), cost legible in reclaimed disgrace-as-sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Canal mud and radio static constrain grappling and deadline tactics; recurring punt hull as micro-setting enables instinctual "listening," charging final serene image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (familial truth) tightens via grapple failures to revelation under textural lens; agency in tactile salvage forecloses ignorance with felt cost in radio silence ending window.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial lies emerges organically via blueprints contrast; sundial reprise reweights riddle without statement, offering resonant CR to "architecture of the lie" premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with tactile perceptual signature ("tactile conversation with the mud"); rhythmic modulation peaks in haul ("shedding mud... like a surfacing leviathan"), no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short haul sentences into reflective cadence); no loops or artifacts, metaphors cohere (bruise water to leviathan) without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tactile detection and sundial paradox transforms legend-seeking trope; risk in poetic compression ("errant legend seeker... architecture of lies") heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
