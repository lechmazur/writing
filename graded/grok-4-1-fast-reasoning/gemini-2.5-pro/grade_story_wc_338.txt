<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with "shielded openness" breached in the "tremor of connection" at discovery, earning the final annotation as a micro-choice revealing values; contradictory impulses act simultaneously without alternating summaries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from map tear to footage comparison to CR closure in "threshold found" annotation, with legible conceptual cost of breaching shields and acknowledging unknown; orientation anchored early in workshop and project.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vault's lichen disrupts growth patterns, constraining the key choice to freeze frames and charging final image of map as threshold; sensory details like "breath fogging" integrate purposefully through POV's archival bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to interpret silence tightens accumulatively at lichen line discovery, narrowing options from repair to annotation with agency in patient observation; cost felt in empathetic rush foreclosing oblivious framing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final annotation reweights tear from "physical wound" to "threshold," offering non-literal answer to silence's theme via particulars without moralizing; resonance emerges organically from mapmaker's preservation act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in "fragile histories" empathy; diction/rhythm modulate from methodical to charged in "silence screamed," maintaining perceptual bias under rising insight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, varied rhythm, and purposeful "silence" motif; minor metaphor density in opening slightly overwrites but pattern-taught and does not touch closure image clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lichen-seal reveal via footage synthesis transforms map-tear trope into fresh conceptual door; risk of silent comparison heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight from methodical curiosity.</comment>
