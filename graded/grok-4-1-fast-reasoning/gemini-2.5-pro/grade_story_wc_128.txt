<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's "profound click of understanding" moment holistically earns the initiation through prior motivation linkage to dockworkers and David's role; contradictory impulses in "cautious exuberance humming just beneath shrewd composure" act in scene without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from letters to locket reveal to envelope; Charged Poise closure lands on-page in Alina's "tears welled... catching the starlight" with legible emotional cost of vulnerability risked.</comment>
