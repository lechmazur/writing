<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion in the breakthrough ("sudden, immense weightlessness that was also a profound weight"), earning the transformation with micro-choices under pressure; motivation rooted in creation, not mere defiance, compels the final shift. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses limits to exceptional but not flawless.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from cosmic gaps to personal heartbeats, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure in the dust's activation and skin-etching ("a line of shimmering obsidian began to flow"); cost legible in permanent verse and "ache and surge of new feathers." Orientation anchored immediately; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden micro-setting constrains and enables via "cool moss" paths and isolation for forbidden dance, charging final image as "the garden's unmoving center"; sensory selection (jasmine, sage, moth pauses) purposeful and POV-biased toward gaps. Stars reconfigure internally, mirroring transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (activate dust for cosmic verse) signaled early, tightens via internal focus reversal ("not the space between stars, but... his own heartbeats"), forcing agency with felt cost in marrow change; one decisive deepening suffices under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-creation emerges organically from dance failure to verse on skin, resonant non-literal answer in "His dance was no longer an act of remembering; it was now an act of being" without moralizing; final image reweights exile premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (gaps as language) stable in single POV, rhythmic modulation peaks in breakthrough ("stars... pouring through his veins"); purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varying rhythm in dance beats; figurative language purposeful in accumulative texture but dense in climax ("cool, dark fire... pinpoint of perfect shadow") borders overwriting without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; clean syntax supports ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tide dance, nostalgia ban, and fledging via gaps transforms tropes; "pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin" premise bold, risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens cosmic stakes organically.</comment>
