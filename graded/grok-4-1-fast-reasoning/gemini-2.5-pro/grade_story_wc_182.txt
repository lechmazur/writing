<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in traits compels higher-stakes renegotiation; interiority concrete and particular via symphony perception. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in key research beats, tilting toward competence without raw ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from gaps to diary-map to silent wall, culminating in Charged Poise RR at staircase opening ("weight of all possible futures on her shoulders") with felt risk cost. Orientation anchored early; one tightening suffices via botanical path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy POV-filtered (vellum rustle, decaying scent, silent hum drop); mountain stacks constrain path through tunnels to living rock wall. Final precipice charges closure image, mirroring internal stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (access for future rescue) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via diary-map to Curator confrontation narrowing options. Agency in presentation forces trade-off; cost legible in heart-beat pause before chord acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unconsulted knowledge as wasted seed emerges organically from gaps-map and "knowledge unconsulted is a seed that never sprouts" argument, resonating in hopeful crescendo finale without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in symphony motif and ink/memory Curators; stable close third-person modulates rhythmically with pressure, peaking in "solo instrument" speech. Minimal dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; purposeful metaphors (symphony, woven roots/pages) cohere without muddle. Minor overwriting in opening sensory stack, but integrates propulsively; no loops dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh botanical cryptology transforms library trope into silent-map path; ink Curators and unlearned lessons premise commits boldly, with diary-leverage turn inevitable from gaps method.</comment>
