<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied in "weary resignation that settled deep in his bones" and trembling hands, with contradictory impulses of failure pull versus last-resort observation compelling the dream choice; final renunciation of solo burden earned via causal dream revelation with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from telescope alignment to stellar ideograms superimposing glyphs, culminating in on-page CR ("The sorrow is not yours alone" echoes as shared lament) with legible conceptual cost in reweighted legacy at awakening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory micro-setting constrains via "gears whispering" and eyepiece against brow, charging final image as sun bathes "dusty room"; selective sensory hierarchy (cold copper, scent of dust/petals) mirrors internal dissolution into dream void.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode via stars signaled early, tightens accumulatively in dream deepening (stars as "glowing ideograms" reveal lament), narrowing to endurance of witnessing with on-page cost in "frantic energy... subsides" foreclosing solitary obsession.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared sorrow emerges organically from glyph-lament revelation, resonating in non-literal final image of telegram as "promise" reweighting prior burden without moralizing; counter-reading of honored loss lingers via cosmic loneliness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature in cosmic-text fusion ("pulsing with meaning right before his eyes"); rhythmic control modulates from "swirling chaos" to dawn calm, compression taught early in dream surrender.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax ("shimmering motes of light, and the void... rushed in"); no loops or artifacts, metaphors coherent ("celestial heartbeat") without muddle in peak dream beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lucid dreaming as stellar decryption transforms obsession trope, with variable-star ideograms yielding sorrow encoding; risk in dream-witnessing heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via grandfather's clue payoff.</comment>
