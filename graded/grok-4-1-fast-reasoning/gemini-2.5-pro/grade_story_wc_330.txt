<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silent carpenter's motivation to interpret silence as possibility drives persistent restoration, culminating in earned singing after a decade's quiet with embodied emotional surge. Internal endurance shows through micro-choices like carving the groove, revealing value hierarchy. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in peak scene, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from discovery ("fingers brushed against something hard") through creation to closure's Resonant Reconfiguration in singing note holding "all his reasons," with felt cost of rusty voice breaking long silence. Orientation anchored early (wrong turn, train meadow). One tightening via fragment's evolving influence suffices; no slips touch closure image of sacred silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Abandoned train's rusted carriages, chipped poplar, and wind bells constrain choices (prying shard, carving groove) and charge final mare's crowned reflection. Sensory hush (misting, tick of decay) mirrors internal state, evolving to shattered symphony. Micro-setting (workbench, chisel) filters through carpenter's tactile priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fill restorative silence with possibility) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fragment's glow spurring creation, tightening to gust-forced singing that crystallizes stance. Agency in persistent work forecloses mere mending path; cost legible in "rusty and yet achingly clear" voice. No reversal but decisive deepening reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of nurturing possibility from decay emerges via particulars (splintered limbs to crowned mare), reweighted in final "silence... a listening" without moralizing. Singing image answers silence-as-oasis question resonantly, tying arc to motivation. Subtext in fragment's "whispering gleam" lingers with ambiguity of completed yet solitary kingdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in tactile silences ("scrape of his own tools") and biased noticing of decay's potential. Lyrical rhythm modulates to frantic bells/singing peak without head-hopping; diction reflects carpenter's quiet persistence. No dialogue, but internal voice coherent and distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences weave action, image, atmosphere (e.g., "pulsed with a faint, internal luminescence"). Varied rhythm avoids monotony; metaphors cohere (spun moonlight, miniature dawn) without muddle in climax. Minor overwriting in reflective opener ("quietly persistent argument") doesn't dull closure; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of derelict train oasis and luminous shard transforms hermit-craftsman trope into inevitable song from silence. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick; halo fragment's reweighting feels organic, not template. Final reconfiguration charges prior particulars uniquely.</comment>
