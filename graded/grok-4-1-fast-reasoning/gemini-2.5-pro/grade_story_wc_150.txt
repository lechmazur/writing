<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's hollowness and warmly curious observation drive micro-choices like purposeful wandering, earning the final acceptance; contradictory impulses surface in initial doubt versus persistent excavation. Minor slip in unembodied "profound hollowness" phrasing early.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with discovery density tightening to CR closure via carving revelation; cost legible in "hollow space inside her begin to fill... with a peaceful acceptance of the questions." Orientation anchored by para 1; no shards, single tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard roots/bones constrain excavation (fig tree grip on sundial) and charge final image of "roots and bones... testament to continuity"; sensory selection (damp soil, blossoms) reflects POV urgency. Micro-setting as recurring roots evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore faith) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via sundial find and carving to foreclose doubt path; agency in wandering/rebuilding shows endurance cost in acceptance over answers. Entry to 8+ via felt trade-off charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interrupted journeys reweight via ship etching as perpetual beginning, resonating non-literally without moralizing; theme emerges organically from roots/bones continuity motif constraining closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (cautious gaze on land's "quiet language"); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise; no dialogue, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "silver vein slithering over... clavicle"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; minor overwriting in stacked modifiers ("purposeful wandering... warmly curious") but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard + sundial carving synthesize fresh diaspora angle; risk in lyric accumulation pays off at CR without gimmickry; transformation of interrupted trope via eternal sail etching.</comment>
