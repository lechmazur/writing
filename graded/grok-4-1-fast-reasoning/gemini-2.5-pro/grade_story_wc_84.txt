<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation to decode the frequency is clear and intensifies through embodied strain ("knuckles were white"), compelling the pull; interiority concrete via "hummed in her bones." Limited contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—mostly competent execution without visible flaws complicating choices—caps at strong band. Closure change (smile of peace) earned by prior causality without unmotivated leap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: chip insert → drone navigation → pull → beam activation = DC closure with felt cost (years chasing whispers resolved). Orientation anchored early ("observatory's brilliant dimness," post-pilgrim). Single scene, one tightening (handle pull reveals lens), no orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory details selective/POV-biased ("soft click swallowed by silence," "stabilizers whining"); observatory dome constrains pull choice, lens charges final image. Micro-setting (Nighthawk drone, obsidian console) lived-in via tactile use. No white-room; dusk peaks evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode frequency) signaled early, tightens via drone strain narrowing options (power fed amid whine); agency in piloting/pull forecloses isolation path. One escalation under causal lens; cost legible in effort ("groan of stone on stone"). No abstract stakes or coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges via chip unlocking "font of pure meaning," reweighting isolation without statement; final image (smile amid symbols) non-literal answer to cosmic conversation. Particulars (star trails, filigree) build resonance organically. No moralizing; ambiguity in "silent conversation" lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV stable, perceptual signature via pilot bias ("sharp-eyed...mapping every facet," starfield overlay). Voice texture distinct (lyric rhythm in "weaving dance between stellar nurseries"); no head-hopping or filter excess. Compression in drone whir/click legible under causal drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "chip slid home...soft click" advances plot/atmosphere). Rhythm varies (short whir/pull sentences amid longer descriptions); minor repetition ("perpetually surprised") but no loops/scaffold touching closure. No figurative muddle; propulsion clear to chime/resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: alien chip in ancient observatory + drone star-trail nav transforms tropes organically. Pull turn inevitable from schematic; risk in intricate path heightens stakes without gimmick. No derivative templates; premise (frequency of belonging) non-obvious angle on cosmic isolation.</comment>
