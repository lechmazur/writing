<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the ghost confrontation ("It wasn't our fault" vs. "It was my fault"), earning the final integration with embodied release of regret as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: echoes build density to wheel's pattern break, yielding on-page Conceptual Repricing ("purpose had shifted... curator of this magnificent failure") with legible emotional cost in shared sorrow and pocketed token.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon and crystallized condensation constrain digging choice and charge final image (swirls no longer taunt but fact), with sensory details (clicking, ozone scent) filtered through scavenger's fractured perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve ghost via fragments) tightens accumulatively through wheel's memory flood, forcing agency in admission that forecloses bargaining path with felt cost of accepted consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of pocketing wheel offers resonant non-literal answer to ambition's erosion, reweighting prior material (fire of ambition to profound sorrow) without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (temporal bleed, congealed sound); rhythmic diction modulates from fractured overlap to crystalline sequence under realization pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful figures ("sound congealed like amber"); zero loops, clean propulsion sustains closure image without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of halted carousel world and echo-scavenging transforms regret trope into inevitable ghost integration, with risk-taking in temporal stillness heightening stakes organically.</comment>
