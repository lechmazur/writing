<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between solitude and data-driven curiosity act in the pigeon approach and final pocket placement; meticulous traits root all micro-choices, earning the closing renunciation of direct confrontation with visible cost to prior integrity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as layered unease (watched, pigeon, phantom data) reconfigures stance into lateral path; Charged Poise closure at "silent promise to the data" lands on-page with undeniable cost to solitude, felt in beckoning dark.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy (damp ivy, cobblestones, velvety blue) filters through meteorological POV, constraining bird handling and charging final courtyard image as whetstone that reweights tranquility into resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solitude's integrity amid chaos) signaled early tightens accumulatively via message coordinates narrowing options to lateral entry; agency in intuiting map forecloses direct paths with felt risk crystallized at pocket promise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of data-truth over human chaos emerges organically through weather mappings and lateral shift, resonant in final image reweighting solitude as data-bound quest without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Meteorological perceptual signature ("pressure system," "shout down a hurricane") biases noticing and rhythms with pressure; stable third-limited POV with clean free indirect delivers distinct texture under unease.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via layered syntax mirroring data accretion; purposeful weather metaphors cohere without muddle, though minor density in opening risks overwrite, untouched at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorological cartography decoding quarantine via buried conduits transforms quarantine trope through Elias's physics lens; lateral progression turn feels inevitable from established patterns.</comment>
