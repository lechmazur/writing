<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's crafty hands persist in polishing amid grief's weight, revealing contradictory impulses that earn the final reconfiguration; embodied sorrow (knuckles white, powdered starlight on fingers) avoids labels. Interior conflict layers without tidy resolution until dream's promise breaks him open. Closing crane fold forecloses drowning void with felt integration cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory waves and polishing density tighten toward basilica RR (Charged Poise in dream's "forever broken" beauty reconfiguring grief). Orientation anchors instantly in workshop/tea garden. One deepening (gem clarification) narrows to legible emotional cost in final stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Floating isles' physics (descend while ascending) constrains climb, pulling into luminous torment that mirrors internal plunge; basilica refracts aether into rainbows, charging dream vessel. Tea garden bookends evolution from wound to peace. Recurrent bamboo skeletons and washi paper integrate tactilely without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape grief via dream) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through memory breaks and polishing ritual forcing endurance; dream revelation forecloses erasure path with "achingly beautiful and forever broken" cost. Agency in ascent/placement crystallizes stance under lens. No coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Grief-as-unfoldable-water transforms via lantern/dream/crane images into "current...with wings," emergent from particulars without statement; final fold reweights loss as integrable force. Subtext in broken promise invites ambiguity on endurance's price. No moralizing, complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual bias (hollowed expression in ponds, luminous dust) character-specific; rhythm modulates from heavy plunge to profound stillness. Compression in climb shards taught early, pays off legibly at closure. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels: "each upward step a plunge deeper into memory" varies rhythm without loops; figurative coherence (formless heavy water, powdered starlight) pattern-taught, no muddle in peak basilica beat. Concision weaves action/atmosphere seamlessly. Read-aloud cadence breathes with ascent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fantasy physics (shadow detach, mnemonic gems, paradoxical stairs) synthesizes grief craft organically; crane fold from lantern-maker roots feels inevitable, transforming loss trope boldly. Risk in textural ascent/descent heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
