<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via perceptual work to earned emotional shift; interiority embodied in toothache, tear of awe, stone thumbing. Chess traits particularize conflict without stereotypes. Minor label in "singular motivation" line slightly abstracts but anchors present choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silences build density to pattern emergence, CR closure in lights/stone drop with harmonized exile cost legible in final paragraph. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: magnetic hum aches teeth, silences textured as chess. Stone as micro-setting charges closure drop. Details constrain perception, evolve with phase shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake signaled early (beauty in chaos), Accumulative escalation via silence charting deepens to pattern/lights revelation. Agency in focus forecloses exile despair with emotional cost. Subtle internal pressure coheres tightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from chess-silences-covenant to discovery in difficulty; final "checkmate" image reweights exile without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with chess-perceptual signature; voice rhythmic, modulates awe in lights paragraph. Prose texture controlled, diction POV-apt (gambit, bishop threats).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; minor overwriting in "ghostly ribbons... pulsing" but purposeful for climax. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion matches perceptual build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chess decoding alien silences transforms exile trope. Risk in perceptual lyricism heightens stakes, inevitable in lights checkmate.</comment>
