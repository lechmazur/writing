<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in restoring connection drives patient micro-choices like building the apparatus and final adjustment; embodied anticipation ("tremor") and gentle touch reveal character. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for 9+; steady progression without internal friction slightly limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from stalled pilgrimage to holographic bloom and glowing resonance; clear orientation in first paragraph. Conceptual Repricing closure lands on-page with cost in "artificial pilgrimage at its end," reweighting sound-as-light via lens clue causality. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (ozone, dust, golden shadows) filter through Elian's reverence; miner's lens and bells constrain choices by enabling transmutation. Final shift to "steady, golden light" charges closure image, mirroring internal discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore connection frequency) signaled early, tightens texturally via "see the echo" realization and apparatus test narrowing auditory assumptions. Protagonist agency in adjustment forecloses force-based path with pilgrimage's end as felt cost. Minor abstractness in stakes prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of visible connection emerges organically from holographic lattice and glowing bell; final image reconfigures premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like interwoven hands pattern avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of precision ("delicate precision of a surgeon"); rhythmic prose modulates from reverence to awe. Elevated diction fits invented world without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; metaphors like "cascades of faint, colored light" purposeful in prism-song context without muddle. Minor overwriting in descriptive runs ("shimmering, intricate lattice... breathtakingly beautiful") slightly dulls peak without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-as-visible-light via miner's lens transforms trope of lost artifact; holographic connection pattern feels inevitable from setup. Risky conceptual pivot heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
