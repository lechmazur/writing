<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation to defy fate roots in consistent backward-ticking trait, compelling lever pull with erasure cost; embodied in "cold fire" and "tremor in soul." Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses in climactic beat prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to lever pull as Charged Poise CR, reconfiguring life via "hands softening" with felt erasure cost; orientation anchors early, lens holds through silent void.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tide's "nadir" constrains timing of pull; hunger stone and chronometer hands charge final image of unspooling, mirroring internal reversal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of fate-defiance deepens accumulatively to assembly/pull, narrowing to erasure trade-off; cost unmistakable in "dizzying lightness" and "unknown."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Unwritten past" final image resonantly reweights causality premise from yoyo loop to cosmic suspension, emergent without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV-stable perceptual signature of "quiet rebellion" and selective ozone/brass noticing; rhythm compresses propulsively to "profound thrum."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; minor opening figurative density ("leviathan bones," "tangled knot") risks slight overload before pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Yoyo-encoded loop into hunger stone chronometer transforms time-trope boldly; "unspooled string" inevitability heightens stakes organically.</comment>
