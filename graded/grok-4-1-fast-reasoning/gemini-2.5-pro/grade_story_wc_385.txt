<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (perceptive gift/curse) act in scene via embodied grief and micro-choices like pitch adjustment; final renunciation of "why" to become song-finisher earned by progressive echoes with tear as cost. Interiority particular (marrow vibrations, shard in heart). No therapy-speak or tidy paths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: song-echo-whisper density builds to nexus heart CR, reweighting echoes as debt with conceptual cost in "perfect silence" realization and tear image. Orientation anchored by para 1; one tightening via crystal match. Persistent shell constraint shapes tactics to harmony.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Body/tool (seashell warms, boots silent) and setting (chasm slices note, starlight pools) constrain choices like deeper movement and frequency match, charging final glow/merge image. Sensory hierarchy perceptive (hum in bones > visual). No tourist catalog; dust/starlight filters urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (echo origins) signaled para 1, deepens accumulatively via "Unfinished" warp to crystal lock, forcing harmony agency with emotional cost (mother's void clarified painfully). One tightening forecloses questioning path. No abstract stakes; tear makes price felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image (tear amid glow, new purpose) offers non-literal answer to "why echo" via debt/resonance reweighting, inextricable from arc without moralizing. Emerges organically from particulars (warped returns, shell-crystal). Ambiguity lingers in "necessary melancholy."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (marrow/bone sensing, silence shapes); rhythmic control modulates from quiet mist to deafening hum under pressure. Lyric compression taught early, legible at harmony payoff. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density (each line advances disclosure/atmosphere); varied rhythm (short note slices vs. weaving melody) propels without loops or scaffolds. Coherent metaphors (webs/shards) in peak crystal beat; no filter stacks or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: echoes as cosmic debt/anchors transformed via perceptual singing and shell-crystal harmony, inevitable hindsight from progressive pattern. Bold lyric fantasy risks poetic voice without gimmick; no template tropes.</comment>
