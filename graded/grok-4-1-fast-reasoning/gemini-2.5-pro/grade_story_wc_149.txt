<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation intensifies credibly through embodied sensations like the "chime echoed... in the marrow of his bones," earning the final memory flood; Lyra's devotion shown via plant changes reveals character under pressure. Minor limit: her actions observed more than crucible-tested in direct interplay.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of glimpses/pattern break at full Lyra appearance; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with cost in her dissolution and his "work... just beginning." Orientation anchored early in greenhouse bubble; one tightening via bolder cameos suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains via "rows of slumbering moon-petal vines" guiding movement and charges final orchid image; sensory hierarchy (chilled breath clouds, toxic dew burns) reflects alchemical urgency, evolving causally with her influence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlocking legacy/debt) signaled early via bead, escalates accumulatively through toxic vibrancy and bud formation to transference; agency in tending enables tightening, cost legible in her "mournful elation" and solitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of debt-repaying poison-love emerges organically from plant mutations and memories; final image of her "perfect fusion of mournful elation" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting "shared promise" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in alchemical noticing ("jewel-like intensity," "internal luminescence"); rhythmic control heightens to climax without slippage, diction purposeful and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "perfumes became intoxicatingly toxic" advances stakes/atmosphere); figurative language consistent in alchemical pattern without muddle, though dense in buildup risks slight overload pre-climax. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost alchemy/orchard transforms tropes via "lovingly venomous" plants and bead-key memories; risk in lyric accumulation pays off inevitably at pollen transference, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
