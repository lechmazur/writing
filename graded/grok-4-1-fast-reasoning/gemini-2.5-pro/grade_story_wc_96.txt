<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's monthly molt trait roots motivations consistently, culminating in the Architect's hopeful response to drifters over Reckoner's potential aggression; embodied in breath catching then rising to offer poem. Elara applies relational pressure without overshadowing. Minor abstraction in "quiet, desperate fire" slightly dilutes contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of salvage, poems, then drifters builds to Charged Poise closure where communal sorting reconfigures solitary rebuild with vulnerability cost legible in tentative entry and poem handoff. Single scene anchors early (library, moon, Elara). No orientation debt; one tightening via strangers suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rusted library girders and starlit dome constrain sorting and charge final silver light on four people, mirroring internal rebuild. Sensory selection (crunched glass, grimy marble) POV-biased to decay/potential. Environment evolves with arrivals, guiding welcoming choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuild against rot) signaled early, tightens accumulatively with tin poems then drifter flicker forcing stance via poem offer—foreclosing isolation at exposure cost. Agency in rising/stepping forward; one deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of forging beauty from anarchy emerges via particulars (warped books to poems to community), final image resonantly reweights resistance as shared without stating moral. Subtext in Elara's hand on arm, drifter's rasp implies complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person on Silas with perceptual bias (decay as cathedral); poetic diction/rhythm consistent, modulates to strength in reading aloud. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Time to plant the garden"), advances arsenal reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; no loops/artifacts dull closure. Minor overwriting in stacked figures ("vagrant penny poet surrounded by water-warped spines") risks muddle but spares peak drifter beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Monthly molts and poems-as-arsenal transform post-apoc survival trope into textural resistance; fresh synthesis in Architect/Reckoner duality inevitable in communal pivot. Bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
