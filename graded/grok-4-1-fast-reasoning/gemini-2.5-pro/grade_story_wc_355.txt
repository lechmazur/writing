<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eclectic pacifist traits shine in sensory interiority and motivation to catalog silences for empathy; attribute drives intuitive tuning with embodied contradictions like tasting anger in frequencies. Final shelving of unread diary earns closure via renunciation of violation, foreclosing reading path with felt privacy cost. No diagnostic speak; flaws like theatricality balance competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory frequencies build density to memory-driven insight, yielding clasp's click as Charged Poise RR with conceptual cost of unread devotion preserved. Orientation anchors in first paragraph (workshop, night, fireworks eve). Single scene causality intact; fireworks thud tightens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Workshop's brass contraptions and copper wires constrain tuning action; fireworks pressure via floor thud and sky eruptions charges final image as counterpoint to captured silence. Sensory details (ozone, pinprick stars) filter through Elias's priorities, evolving with external blasts. Micro-setting (velvet cushion, calipers) guides choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture grandmother's silence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via failed frequencies and time thud narrowing to memory agency; insight forecloses machine reliance with cost of vulnerability. Fireworks force stance crystallization before chaos. One tightening suffices; cost legible in preserved privacy amid intrusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence as empathy path emerges via failed tunings to devoted hush repricing noise as counterpoint; final shelving reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in clasp's protective love layers ambiguity of unspoken hearts. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (tasting colors, hearing textures) biases noticing; voice modulates rhythmically from theatrical murmurs to quiet insight. Prose syntax reflects intuitive mind under time pressure. No head-hopping; elision of diary contents purposeful for cost.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene urgency (short hums amid rising tension); density high, metaphors purposeful (velvet hush, sun-warmed stone) without muddle in peak tuning beat. Minor figurative density in opening but integrates; no loops, clear propulsion to click.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia and silence-capture transforms pacifist quirk into frequency empathy; risk of whimsy pays off in clasp's organic opening and fireworks counterpoint. Premise commits to emotional physics without retreat; final image inevitable hindsight.</comment>
