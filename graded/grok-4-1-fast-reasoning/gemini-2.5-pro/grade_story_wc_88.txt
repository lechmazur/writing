<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interior numbness and micro-choices (searching ads, descending) reveal character under pressure, earning the final empathy spark; minor therapy-speak in motivation ("kindle empathy") slightly abstracts without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain from baseball to ads' coordinates to cavern letter holds tightly to CR closure, with descent as pivotal tightening; orientation anchored early, cost legible in "pierced the grey numbness."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake charges final image, mirroring endurance and constraining reflection; selective sensory glow and damp air filter through jaded POV, evolving with descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (past ghost vs. sterile peace) signaled early, tightens via fissure choice narrowing options; agency in following trail culminates in felt cost of spark amid endurance image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of kindling empathy emerges organically from letter and lake particulars, reweighting past-unearthing to future-building without moralizing; final spark offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature of grey numbness shifting to "jaded wonder"; rhythmic prose modulates intensity, no head-hopping or withholdings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels through descent; minor figurative pile-up ("labyrinth," "ghost," "pinprick") in opening slightly muddles but spares closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clean-slate trope with time-traveler ball breadcrumb and biolum quest transforms redemption arc; risk in underground payoff feels inevitable via prior causality.</comment>
