<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in denial vs. acceptance of the memory, embodied in "pain wash over him"; final wholeness earned by prior causality without unearned epiphany. Micro-choices like drifting upward reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of realizations builds to CR closure where "viaduct’s glow softened, then faded"; cost legible in lost buoyancy and integrated echoes. Orientation anchored immediately; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glowing viaduct and rain-slick tarmac constrain floating choices and charge final dawn image; sensory hierarchy (ozone taste, cool tablet) reflects POV urgency. "Shadows pooling... creep higher" mirrors internal stakes purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape loop) deepens via acceptance, foreclosing denial path under Accumulative lens; agency in opening to memory narrows options with "sickening lurch" cost on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of self-conquest emerges organically from memory acceptance reweighting denial; final "standing solidly... whole again" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in shifting runes and geometry; rhythmic control modulates from frenetic to stabilizing, enhancing pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but minor overwriting in "fallen star" droplets slightly blurs peak realization beat without touching closure. No loops; rhythm supports cadence shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of procedural prison and memory-seed origin transforms time-loop trope; "procedural generation" payoff feels inevitable from particulars, heightening stakes boldly.</comment>
