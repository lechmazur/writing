<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in grandmother's slate and obsession; embodied emotions like "pressure in his chest eased" show progression. Minor slip in subtle internal contradiction—meditative focus dominates without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final endurance/peace earned by retracing causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via night-after-night retracing to storm nexus; CR closure lands on-page in "he understood" with legible conceptual cost of grief's networked shape reweighting individual loss. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse; ellipses motivated and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "vines crawled the glass like skeletal fingers" and storm "rattled the greenhouse's fragile panes" mirror internal thundering and constrain meditative choice. Greenhouse as micro-setting charges climax; recurring butterflies evolve with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of discovering grief's shape signaled early, tightens accumulatively to storm reversal narrowing to "nexus"; agency in persistent retracing forecloses aimless melancholy with felt emotional cost. One deepening suffices; pressure coheres without abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of collective grief as interconnected network emerges organically via ribbons, butterflies, veins to web image; final slate "intricate, abstract web" offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars drive complexity, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature: patterns in stone/ribbons/biologists filter meditative bias. Rhythmic prose modulates intensity ("thundering calm"); purposeful compression in ellipses taught early and legible at CR closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—figuratives like "overlapping flight paths of a thousand butterflies" purposeful and coherent. Propulsion aligns with meditative peaks; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravestone carver's grief-mapping via unfinished slate, ribbons, and butterfly migration transforms mourning trope into networked endurance. Risky meditative structure heightens stakes; inevitable in hindsight from particulars.</comment>
