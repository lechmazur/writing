<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular via cartographer's eye on frost-map; subtly confident trait shown in "quiet focus" grabbing spectrograph, earning shift from skeptic to archivist with conceptual cost to life's work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to frost-map CR reweighting premise (phenomenon over place) with undeniable conceptual cost in "his life's work... a joke"; orientation anchored early, no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen lake and outpost window constrain observation and charge final glowing frost-map image; sensory hierarchy (falcon's speck, condensation bloom) reflects professional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rivers' source) signaled early, deepens via falcon → phrasebook → map under Accumulative lens with agency in sustained watch; cost legible in realization foreclosing static mapping career.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of static maps vs. dynamic flow emerges via watershed frost, resonant CR in "rivers remembered their beginning" reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature (fractal veins, starlike point); rhythmic control modulates to humming dark, no head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in revelation); purposeful metaphors like "feathery lines" propel without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hydro-geology and frost-fractal map transforms ghost-hunt trope; risk in lyric CR heightens conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
