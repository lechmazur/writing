<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Kael's frustration versus the required vanishing, earning the final realization as he sees Elara's retracting life; micro-choices like leaning forward reveal values under pressure. Interiority particular via anchor of lost sister. Voice distinction clear in dialogue idioms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pebble splash initiates ripple density building to reversal and CR closure where pond's collapse reconfigures self-anchoring with cost of released desire. Orientation anchored immediately in platform/pond. No slips touch revelation beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pond and grotto constrain revelation method and charge final mirror image; sensory hierarchy (visual ripples, thrum hum, tunic scrape) reflects meditative urgency. Spatial choreography coherent throughout trance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn appearing via vanishing) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through ripple visions of paths/anchor to deepening reversal narrowing options; cost legible in "release of the anchor" felt in "I see."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of retraction over erasure emerges organically via ripples reversing and Elara's life; final pond image resonantly reweights premise without moralizing, tying to Kael's desire.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature biases toward impatience yielding to insight; dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("cannot rush the tide"). Rhythmic control modulates with trance intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: no loops, metaphors cohere (ripples as futures/return), rhythm varies for trance buildup. Elevated diction fits fantasy voice without drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ripple-reversal for temporal vanishing transforms meditation trope freshly; Elara's backwards life integrates organically. Minor familiarity in guru-pupil dynamic.</comment>
