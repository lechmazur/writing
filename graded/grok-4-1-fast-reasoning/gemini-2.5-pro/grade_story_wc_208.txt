<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in panic-then-clarity during wave buildup, earning final custodianship shift with embodied cost (dripping, shivering); interiority particular via artist's eye on wood as "stories of violence and grace."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: slide discovery → projection → diagram → bulwark saves archway; CR closure via final realization reweights premise (driftwood as language) with undeniable conceptual cost in "rebuilding a world," legible in last lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Archway constrains projection wall and bulwark materials, charging final image of scattered driftwood; sensory hierarchy narrows to "deafening crack" and "shushing roar" in climax, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Agency drives escalation under causal lens: diagram insight narrows to desperate build, foreclosing death path with thigh-soaking cost; dominant survival stake tightens coherently to Charged Poise in receding water.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of driftwood as "letters in a language" offers non-literal answer to alliance theme, reweighting prior layers without moralizing; emerges organically from particulars like seal-creatures and captains.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in artist's bias ("muses in the sea’s castoffs") modulates with stress to clipped clarity ("hands and mind working in perfect, desperate sync"); stable close-3rd POV, rhythmic control peaks clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (short punchy climax sentences vs. flowing opening); minor overwriting in opening figures ("timewoven alliances") coherent and pattern-taught, not muddling peak wave beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Magic lantern slide transforms storm trope into millennia-pact diagram, synthesizing post-GPS driftwood art with sea alliances; fresh CR via "covenant" slide feels inevitable, bold risk heightens without gimmick.</comment>
