<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quiet drive hardens credibly into obsession, compelling whistle climax; final motivation shift to "make them believe" earned via map realization with isolation cost. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds patterns to CR closure via map projection reweighting watchers as lighthouses; conceptual cost of extinction undeniable in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Turtle-city shells and whelk tower constrain tower-top whistle action; endless sun pressures dread, charges final copper-rust descent image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher watchers) tightens accumulatively via sequence mastery and whistle blow, agency foreclosing hope with extinction knowledge cost legible at projection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>CR map answers premise non-literally (warnings ignored lead to doom), reweighting persistence theme organically without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (patterns in foam, groans, light); rhythmic prose modulates dread to crystallized certainty under climax stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; minor dread paraphrase in mid-section ("sun-baked certainty," "absolute certainty") avoids closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Non-obvious turtle-drift to Maw synthesis feels inevitable; light-as-language transforms tropes, risk-taking in sonic syntax heightens doom stakes.</comment>
