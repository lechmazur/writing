<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the rage coiling yet stilled by intuition during the revelation, earning the shift from arsonist to curator with embodied tenderness "threatened to crack his ribs." Final choice to wield a brush fulfills the promise with visible cost of past isolation. No unearned epiphanies; traits shown through pattern-seeing actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries densify to the light projection onto the slash, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure where vandalism becomes canvas, reweighting erasure with defiant cost in the final image of reaching for the brush. Orientation anchored early (archive, 5 years off-grid). One tightening via layered reveals suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archive's petrified paper, basalt petroglyphs, and fissure constrain choices, supplying pigments for completion and charging the final image. Sensory selection (dust-choked silence, time's scent) reflects analytical urgency, integrated into trail-following action without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue sister's truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through trail discoveries narrowing to the chamber revelation, forcing renunciation of fire for creation with legible cost of scorched isolation. Agency in aligning tapestry drives deepening; one pressure point suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of defiant creation from violation emerges implicitly via slash-as-canvas reveal, final brush-reach reweighting destruction-to-art without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like chemical shimmer, inviting reflection on erasure's survival.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: pattern-seeing bias ("almost imperceptible shifts") biases details character-specifically. Rhythmic prose modulates from discovery tension to calm resolve; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "quiet detonation in his chest" advances emotion and stakes); varied rhythm passes read-aloud. Minor figurative density in revelation ("diamond resolve") purposeful, not obscuring closure; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious tapestry-as-lens projection transforms trope of hidden message into irreplaceable art-defiance synthesis, risking poetic compression that heightens tenderness-from-rage stakes organically. Fresh volcanic-to-enduring-fire arc feels inevitable.</comment>
