<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's intuitive process and empathetic mapping earn the revelation choice with embodied visions of Jorn's mend and Mara's trauma; secondary pressure from Mara and Jorn coheres without headcount blur. Direct "motivation was simple, yet endlessly complex" tells slightly over embodied micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds from accusation to scrying via crystal-mirror, delivering on-page Charged Poise closure in Mara's "shuddering sigh" with legible emotional cost of shared fragility. Orientation anchors lighthouse orchard early; single scene fits defaults seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frost-rimmed apple boughs and lighthouse's "haphazard vintage store" constrain Kael's intuitive path to the cheval mirror, charging final orchard reconciliation; shifting ice floes below mirror internal fears purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Schism stake signaled early tightens causally through visions disproving sabotage, forcing empathetic reconfiguration; Mara's sigh pays visible relational cost, protagonist agency intact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Empathy-as-action emerges implicitly from visions bridging intent and fear, resonating non-literally in "weary understanding" and sigh that reweights accusation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "flicker of an image" and rhythmic diction modulates tension; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual in Mara's accusation tightness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety and density propel from "frozen air" tension to release; "weighted breath" motif purposeful without loop, though minor figurative density in opening risks slight overwatch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quartz shard in vintage mirrors transforms scrying trope into intuitive truth-mapping amid ice-perched orchard; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight, heightening isolation stakes.</comment>
