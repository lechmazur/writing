<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via thermal embodiment; contradictory impulses peak when trauma orange erupts, compelling weave with exhaustion cost. Final peace earned by prior micro-choices like finger-hover coaxing. Minor epiphanic fade at "silence... new music" but anchored in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from violet bud to trauma intrusion to woven light symphony. Closure as Charged Poise RR in final glass image and cereus bloom, cost legible in "deep exhaustion... profound peace." Orientation anchored early in conservatory/shipwreck world.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Winterglass panes constrain as "score" for projection, charging climax weave and final fade. Selective sensory filter (chilled feet, humid green, thermal hues) biases via Elara's priorities. Body/circlet as micro-setting shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence-to-music) signaled early, tightens via trauma intrusion pattern-break narrowing to weave-or-fail. Agency in "surge of will" forecloses erasure path with embodied cost. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, minor abstract joy stake softens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges via color-weave: trauma reshaped into beauty, silence as "space... new music." Final pearlescent white/closed case reweights premise without moralizing. Violet persistence tests thematic question organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited third with thermal perceptual signature ("cool blues... placid gold"). Lyrical rhythm modulates intensity, compression purposeful in peak weave. No elision or distance slips; voice biased to silent patterns.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; propulsion peaks in "violet deepened, swirling... bud tremble." Minor figurative density ("incandescent violet... hopeful hum") in climax risks overwrite but pattern-taught, no loops or muddle obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-noise thermal music from trauma weaves inevitability from particulars like circlet/node. Bold lyric risk (color symphony) heightens stakes, transforms silence trope without gimmick.</comment>
