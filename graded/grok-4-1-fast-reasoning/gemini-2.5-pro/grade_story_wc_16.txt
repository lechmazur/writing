<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's interior contradiction—carefully reckless precision amid frantic heart—embodies fear of inadequacy driving the modified symphony; final vulnerability in empty vial earns Elara's reach as Charged Poise. Blind spots compound via omitted burden, revealed in lattice confession. No therapy-speak; emotions layered in embodied thrill and peril.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Oriented immediately in archive with Kaelen tracing sigil; accumulative/textural lens builds via glyph chain to glowing lattice drawing Elara, landing Charged Poise closure ("fragile, resonant chord of hope") with legible cost in recklessness and empty vial. No lens ambiguity; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archive's dust motes, moonlight beam, and shelves constrain meddling peril, mirroring internal fragility; glass ink well as micro-setting charges final image via empty transparency. Sensory hierarchy (silvery ink hum) reflects scholarly bias; evolves causally with spell activation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore trust) signaled early, tightens texturally via final glyph loop risking shatter; agency in arrogant modification forecloses safe paths with cost in bone-deep agony shown in lattice. Elara's arrival complicates without resolving; pressure coheres to hand-reach crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-vulnerable-symphony emerges via lattice weaving omission into harmony, reweighting silence in final hand-reach without moralizing. Particulars (blood-ink, modified clause) resist binaries; irony in reckless magic confronting fears lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with perceptual signature (glyphs as vows/chords); rhythmic modulation peaks in "heart-stopping second" compression under stress. Diction scholarly-magical, biased to linguistic peril; no head-hopping despite Elara's entry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., ink well links gift, blood, sincerity); varied rhythm, no loops though "carefully reckless" recurs purposefully. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("dust motes danced like constellations") but purposeful, not obscuring lattice climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Proto-Aenic symphonies transform linguistic magic into emotional contract with fresh modification gamble; risk in personal clause heightens stakes organically. No template echoes; synthesis of archive peril and relational crux feels inevitable in glowing confession.</comment>
