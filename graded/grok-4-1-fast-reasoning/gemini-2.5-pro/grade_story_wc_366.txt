<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's reticence and bond-driven motivation compel the protective journey and repair, with embodied dread ("cold dread, sharp and unfamiliar") and ache showing contradictory impulses acting in the climax; final stone circle earns closure as renunciation of personal connection with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of silent exchanges builds density, light's failure breaks it decisively, repair and circle stone cadence-shift to Charged Poise RR with legible ache-cost in sea glass image; orientation anchored early in porch scene, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Storm-churned sea and cliff stairs constrain ascent and repair, Fresnel lens absorbs light mirroring loss; recurrent stones and sea glass as micro-settings charge final image, sensory narrowing under crisis (wind howl, slick stairs) reflects urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect light/bond/safety) signaled early via beam's "heartbeat," tightens via keeper's absence deepening to solitary endurance; agency in fuel-line fix forecloses heroic rescue with emotional cost crystallized in "luminescent ache."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of fragile distance-intimacy emerges organically from stone/ note patterns and loss, final sea glass refracting beam offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting safety as enduring ache without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (sea as "part of this sea," stones as "language of balance"); rhythmic control modulates from quiet routine to storm compression, diction biased to tactile/maritime idiom without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and integrated sensory image (e.g., "churning the black water into a frenzy"); minor modifier stacks in opening ("practiced, silent economy") but closure propulsion clean, no loops or artifacts dulling repair beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive stone-message language transforms isolation trope, fresh anonymous bond via notes/glass inflects lighthouse archetype; risk-taking in lyric closure heightens emotional stakes, inevitable in hindsight from established patterns.</comment>
