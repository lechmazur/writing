<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's fault-tolerant oracle nature drives contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—both Liam realities equally clear—forcing the earned renunciation of deciphering; interiority embodied in "breath pluming" and micro-choices like avoiding the desk reveal hierarchy of values with cost. Flaw of needing ambiguity complicates without hedging. Final placement of illustration forecloses certainty path with felt emotional price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to CR closure where "the truth was... in the smudging" reweights premise, ambiguity as needed preservation, with undeniable cost in "clean, high-altitude ache." Orientation anchored early in station details; single scene coherent, no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory hierarchy (barograph click, wind whine, ozone) reflects Elara's peripheral awareness, constraining choices like drifting to window post; illustration as micro-setting charges final image on sill. Mirrors internal sway without overt symbolism; weather pressures silence post-fever.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (swallowed truth's weight) signaled early, deepens via squint at smudge narrowing to dual realities, reweighting under Accumulative lens; agency in renouncing decipher with on-page cost ("sigh... ache"). Minor abstractness in initial grief slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserved ambiguity emerges organically from illustration's shift—uncertain story illuminated—offering resonant non-literal answer via final placement; subtext in silence/gesture avoids morals. Complexity lingers without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("wide, soft net"); rhythmic modulation heightens under stress, diction controlled (lyric compression taught early). Elevated phrasing fits oracular voice without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm/syntax; figurative layering ("auroral sorrow," "collapse the waveform") purposeful in reflective mode, no muddle or loops. Minor density in opening metaphors borders overwrite but integrates without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: alpine bloom/smudged note transforms grief into quantum ambiguity via science metaphors (oracle, waveform); risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes.</comment>
