<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between performative lightness and private grief, embodied in narration dropping for silent whittling; final shrine earned via micro-choices with moral cost; minor diagnostic phrasing like "morally ambiguous act" slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual actions build density to Charged Poise closure in bird-nesting tableau ("sliver of lightness... enough"), reconfiguring grief with legible conceptual cost of endured mandate; orientation anchored immediately, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Turbines' "whump-whump-whump" as monstrous heart recurrently pressures internal hush, kitchen/table lived-in via tactile whittling and steaming mug; final bouquet/bird image charged by environmental isolation, no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lightness in grief) deepens accumulatively from public narration to private carving/integration, narrowing to renunciation of full scream; cost felt in guilt over Mara and persistent "not happiness"; tightening sufficient without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of contraband grief vs. mandate emerges organically via ritual forging "remade hush," final image non-literally reweighting forced joy with earned ambiguity; no moralizing, resonance from particulars like skeletal bouquet.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with theatrical perceptual signature mirroring Elias's narration ("chalice worthy of ritual"); rhythmic control modulates from stage whisper to flat close; no head-hopping, diction biased to grief-filtered details.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring ritual cadence; purposeful metaphors (dust motes, rust tea) integrate without muddle; minor paraphrase in turbine noise descriptions, but no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of happiness mandate, turbine oppression, and grief-ritual yielding carved bird-shrine; risk in quiet stasis closure heightens stakes on contraband emotion; no template tropes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
