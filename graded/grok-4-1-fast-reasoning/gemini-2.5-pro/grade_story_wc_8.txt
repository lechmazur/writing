<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aris's precise, career-rooted motivation drives persuasion; Elara's guardianship yields to parallels in the "resigned click," earning her shift with embodied cost in clutching hands becoming millstone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via argument chain ("studying the archives... Ashworth Collapse") tightening to decisive handover; closure DC lands with legible emotional cost in Elara's posture shift and vellum slide.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ivy-choked station anchors vividly, constraining Aris's analogy ("pointed to the ivy strangling the station") and charging thematic suffocation in derelict hall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (relic recapture) escalates through causal parallels foreclosing Elara's defense, forcing trade-off visible in her unfastening latches with resignation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Noble lies theme emerges organically from parallels vs. peace defense, reweighted non-literally in vellum handover as "gilded cage" escape without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Aris's metronome precision; dialogue subtext in Elara's "thin" voice advances persuasion naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates action-imagery ("dust motes danced"); purposeful metaphors like "hungry thing" propel without loops or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Intellectual "extraction" via historical parallels transforms relic trope into principled debate, fresh in dispassionate persuasion.</comment>
