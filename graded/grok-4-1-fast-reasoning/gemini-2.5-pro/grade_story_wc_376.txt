<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation as truth-seeker rooted in calligrapher's precision compels piecing the map and vault entry, with embodied tension in "hand trembled slightly." Final shift to cultivator earned by prior obsession, foreclosing ornamental craft with conceptual cost. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in daily market vs. obsession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fern cue to map assembly ("days turned into weeks") to vault CR, where seeds reprice lost truth with promise/cost of seeding city. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse city; one tightening via zinc plate suffices. Closure CR on-page: placard realization and plaza planting make before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silver-Vein fern recurs as constraint (wilts near haggling dishonesty) and charges final image linking to Veritas Bloom. Setting tactile/lived: warped floorboard yields map, shafts lead to arboretum; greenhouse humidity warps boards, mirroring internal quest. Sensory selective via POV (ink smell, cleaner air).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore authenticity) signaled via fern/market opener, accumulates texturally to revelation tightening options from search to cultivation. Agency in piecing/following/inserting plate/placing seed; cost felt in role foreclosure ("not just... anymore"). Escalation coherent under lens without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of regrowable truth emerges implicitly from fern-map-seeds arc, final plaza planting offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moral. Veritas placard ("soil of sincerity") integrates organically, ambiguity in "million tiny... conversations" lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: notices script loops, ink fades, fern curls character-particularly. Prose rhythm modulates (short sentences at vault click); distinct texture in "sweet poison... recycled air." No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "fern always knew; it was an heirloom attribute" advances world/character/stakes). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative purposeful ("oasis of honesty") without muddle in peak vault beat. Propulsion clear to closure image.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: truth as cultivable seeds from postal relic/map in greenhouse dystopia transforms tropes organically. Ingenuity peaks in "lost conversations... atmosphere" repricing, risk in quiet CR heightened by calligrapher's tools enabling turns.</comment>
