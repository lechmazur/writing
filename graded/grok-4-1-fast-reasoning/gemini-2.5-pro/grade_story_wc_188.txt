<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Slump against buttress embodies discouragement with contradictory persistence via chants; rag handling reveals fireworks-specific micro-choices turning to insight, earning final smile with visible cost of prior futility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ambient awareness density breaks via rag knot's pattern lesson, tightening to wall schematic CR with conceptual cost of reseeing hush as canvas.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Moon-petal vines and blood-blossom moss constrain perception, filtering into schematic that charges final image; sensory hierarchy (scents, sighs, hums) reflects fireworks lens without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to defy hopelessness signaled early, deepens via rag-enabled filtering that forecloses broad listening; agency in awareness crystallizes stance with discouragement's felt seep.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Hope-as-pattern emerges from decay-life mosaic and rag blueprint, reweighting premise in final chant without moral; fortress realization non-literally answers search with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fireworks-inflected perceptual signature (chemical chants to colors) stable, rhythmic modulation from rhythmic gait to joyful litany under stress; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High-density propulsion in lines like “million tiny points of data”; varied rhythm, coherent metaphors (gravity, canvas), zero loops or artifacts even in peak decode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fireworks designer decoding bioluminescent ruin-mosaic via rag synthesizes fresh alchemy of pattern-perception; transforms seeker trope through ambient schematics without hedging.</comment>
