<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's spiraling calm and pity enable precise micro-choices like shutter-weaving, revealing a hierarchy of values in the deliberate non-aggression; final permanent crack forecloses erasure with earned promise-cost. Contradictory impulses subtle but embodied in empathy vs. darkness's despair resonance. Exceptional single-POV integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: early child-secret anchors orientation by para 2, weaves density to light-plunge DC/RR closure with legible cost in "permanent crack... promise." No orientation debt; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, shutters, water-mirror constrain choices (weaving paths, light dance) and charge final sliver-image; rain-slick specificity filters through guardian bias, tactile and purposeful. Recurrent water/object evolution mirrors internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teach via light) signaled para 2, textural tightening via tremor response and beam-plunge narrows to bloom-acknowledgement; agency in mirror-tilt forecloses dread with sleep-quiet cost on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Empathy-to-stars theme emerges via shutter-patterns and beam-messenger, final crack reweights loneliness without moral; resonant non-literal answer in "darkness knew it was not alone."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable, perceptual signature in light/shadow noticing biases calm resolve; rhythmic compression peaks at "tiny, reflected spark... plunged beneath," voice-modulates tension seamlessly. No head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels (e.g., short "It danced... It was a messenger"); no loops/artifacts, figurative coherence in weaving/loom sustains without muddle, even in peak beam-beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Dental mirror/shutter ingenuity transforms canal-darkness trope into fresh light-language synthesis; risk in lyric patterns inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
