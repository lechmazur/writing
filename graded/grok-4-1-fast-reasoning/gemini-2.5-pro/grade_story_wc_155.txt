<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (desperation vs. gentle coaxing) act in the painting beat, earning the final pensive smile with embodied cost in chest ache and sorrow. Interiority particular to faded artist (phantom limb memory). Micro-choices under pressure reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to fragment snap ("breathtaking snap"), RR closure in fraying mural with impermanence cost legible in "soft sorrow of its passing." Orientation anchored by ~50 words. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fog and fragment constrain choices (reclaims colors, anchors image), charging final dissolution. Sensory hierarchy (damp moss, cool shard, pearlescent beam) reflects artist's priorities. Skeletal espaliers mirror internal fog without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover joy) tightens via frustration ("wavering, bleeding") to fragment-enabled snap, narrowing distortion option with agency in coaxing. Cost unmistakable in bittersweet reconfiguration ("joy rediscovered... in the fleeting act"). Lens escalation via density reweights.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image (pensive smile mirroring mural) resonantly reweights theme of impermanent joy without moral, emerging from particulars like light-snap and fraying. Subtext in silent laughter's pressure invites lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (light/memory bias: "fragile, light-saturated negative"). Lyrical rhythm modulates intensity (short sentences in snap: "locked into place with a silent, breathtaking snap"). No elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (multi-job lines like beam on fragment); varied rhythm passes read-aloud. Purposeful figuratives ("grey silk," "exposed film") taught early without muddle in peak snap beat. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Light-painting + fragment anchor synthesizes fresh memory-recovery frame; daydream fold risks bold lyric structure heightening stakes of impermanence. Inevitable hindsight from film-concept buildup.</comment>
