<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dual allegiance torment vividly embodied in "pulling him apart," driving simultaneous impulses toward rage or reorganization; final endurance via subtle revolution earned through prior micro-choices like approaching Zola. Foundation stone chip reveals attachment under pressure. Contradictory traits act in scene without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as graffiti patterns build density to inspector's "flicker of confusion," yielding conceptual repricing (CR) closure where "data-slate full of contradictions" and final stone image reweight chaos/order premise with felt cost of inevitable change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Raft city's graffiti surfaces constrain choices (encode messages) and charge final image (language survives "coming tide"); sensory details like "thrum... through soles" and "neon kraken" filter through Kael's orderly bias, evolving with art's hidden order.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigate gentrification via reorganization) signaled early, tightens texturally via art's "new kind of coherence" forcing inspector's "certainty wavered"; agency in encoding narrows options with on-page cost of unaverted change legible in final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden order surviving imposition emerges organically from graffiti's shift in perception, resonant in "painted bright against the coming tide" without moralizing; dual allegiance friction yields non-literal answer reweighting anarchy's viability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of orderly charting amid chaos; rhythmic prose modulates from sensory immersion ("sizzling fry-oil") to charged introspection; brief dialogue to Zola carries subtext and goal advancement naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and no loops; propulsion aligns with pressure, from opening "thrum... soles" anchor to final image's cadence; purposeful sensory integration avoids overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of raft-carnival chaos encoded with order transforms resistance tropes; graffiti-ledging ingenuity feels inevitable from Kael's trait, risking mosaic shards that heighten stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
