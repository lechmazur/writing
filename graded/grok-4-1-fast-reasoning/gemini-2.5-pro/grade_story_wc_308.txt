<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelan's reverent patience constrains crude search, earning psychic skim that forecloses waiting with felt peace. Contradictory impulses—reverence vs. pulse's scream—act in bird-reading beat. Motivation intensifies via arrowhead's vibration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wind-peeled grit to flock scatter mapping sorrow, culminating in RR via hummed thought and canyon sigh. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure reconfiguration legible with stillness cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Bone towers and echoes constrain reverent search, wind reveals arrowhead. Flock in rust sky charges story map. Sensory hierarchy (vibrations over sight) biases via skimmer priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve pulse for navigation) signaled early, deepens via flock revelation of hunter's regret, agency in psychic skim forecloses unrest with peace cost. Textural pressure tightens to frantic scream peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sorrow-map via flock reweights "navigation without moving" premise, answering via harmony without moral. Emerges organically from pulse resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-limited with harmonic perceptual signature (frequencies, breaths). Rhythmic modulation peaks in "flick of pure will." No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density (e.g., "frantic, silent scream trapped in the volcanic glass" advances three layers). Varied rhythm accelerates to closure hum without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bird-flock augury maps ghost-regret in bone-echo canyon, risk of psychic non-action pays off in path-unfurl image.</comment>
