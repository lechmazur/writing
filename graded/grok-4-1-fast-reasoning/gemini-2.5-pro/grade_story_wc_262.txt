<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through Elara's push deeper into residue, embodied in sensory builds; interiority concrete and particular ("scent of ink... texture of wooden desk"). Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal vision beat, muting internal conflict depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density swells from touch to vision to CR closure ("Unused love... soul of a place") with conceptual cost in journey's resolution and reverence. Orientation anchored early; vision shard legible as motivated deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy vivid and POV-biased (dust "rust and regret," celluloid "cool and sharp"); setting absorbs love, constraining revelation and charging final image of film's inertness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early, escalates via density ("pressure... behind a dam") narrowing to CR under accumulative lens; agency in "pushing deeper" with felt cost in breathless receding vision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (letters filmed, light absorbed); final CR reweights premise without moralizing, resonant in "soul of a place" image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature ("build the world from inside out"); rhythmic lyricism modulates intensity, diction controlled and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; purposeful lyric metaphors ("hushed thunder") taught early without muddle. Minor paraphrase in silence motifs ("specific frequency of absence") avoids loop penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry on filmic love-remnants transforms trope into conceptual CR; risk in spatial-vision lyricism heightens stakes organically.</comment>
