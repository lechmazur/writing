<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority peaks in "thrumming in his bones" and dissolution, with motivation rooted in aesthetic yearning compelling the core choice to let go; minor abstractness in "pure structure" slightly dilutes contradiction before the earned change to kindred spirit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to on-page CR closure—"the colonnade was not chaos; it was a blueprint"—reconfiguring premise with cost in "shivering... profound quietude"; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (teeth-thrum, lantern-moth hush) filters through poet's bias, charging final frozen lake as "blank page"; cobalt atrium and quartz constrain immersion choice, mirroring internal softening without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand quartz grammar) tightens accumulatively via self-dissolution risking madness, agency in "letting... self soften" foreclosing separation with felt bodily cost; legible in shivering post-tremor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of direct aesthetic truth vs. authority emerges organically from particulars, final image reweights silence as "presence" answering sacred-boundary question without moralizing; resonant ambiguity in regime's fear lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "cloud-shadow poet" diction and rhythmic modulation under dissolution pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in legible CR closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image integration like "geological time and starlight"; no loops or artifacts, minor dense metaphors cohere without muddling tremor peak.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forbidden site as crystalline poem transforms epiphany trope through quartz blueprint realization; risk-taking in boundary-dissolution immersion heightens stakes organically.</comment>
