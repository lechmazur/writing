<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to prove cosmic meaning intensifies through embodied doubt at climax ("resolve wavered"), compelling the keystone insertion with felt loneliness cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene via retrocognitive grief versus thistle hope, earning the final endurance. Interiority particular via specific visions guiding assembly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from polishing/visions to star-aligned assembly, delivering on-page Decisive Change ("fit was perfect... beacon lived") with emotional cost legible in "his own loneliness felt ancient." Orientation anchors immediately (Elian at Spire pavilion post-collapse). Single scene coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pavilion dome as lens constrains star-tracking/assembly choices; starlight "striping the floor" charges final beam image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: cosmic focus amid silence, body in "hands shaking." Details tactile (etched slates, velvet cloth) evolve with action, mirroring internal hush-to-thrum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle/prove meaning) signaled early, tightens via rare Cygnus alignment forcing tonight's assembly; agency in shard placement forecloses doubt-path with wavering cost. Accumulative escalation reweights via deepening hush-scream opposition. Cost unmistakable in endured loneliness against "suffocating void."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (silence as pause, coincidences as design) emerges organically from star-map visions and prism arcs, reweighted non-literally by final "fragile heartbeat" beam answering isolation premise. Returning thistle-hope image shifts from fragile seed to proven pulse without moralizing. Complexity in ambiguity of old vs. new beacon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: retrocognitive/cosmic bias in "arcs that mirrored the star-lanes." Prose texture modulates rhythm from meditative ("thistle seed") to propulsive climax. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in visions anchors present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "light refracted weakly... broken rainbow" advances plot/atmosphere). Varied rhythm accelerates to closure without loops or scaffolds; specific diction ("Cygnus Rift") propels. Zero figurative muddle in peak "shard into place" beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: shatter-fragments as star-map via retrocognition transforms post-apoc beacon trope into faith-driven cosmic proof. Risky quiet lyric closure ("gentle thrum... message") heightens fragile hope stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from early prism obsession.</comment>
