<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent, driving precise actions to closure; Operator's belief in change compels the uncorking and tracing. Interiority leans abstract and philosophical ("True existence... was change") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure, limiting depth in pivotal frost-tracing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of frost patterns and resonance build to rupture's Conceptual Repricing, compressing eternity with legible conceptual cost ("perfect system was gone"). Orientation anchored early in glass orchard; single scene coherent, closure image pays off destabilization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting vividly specific and purposeful; temperature differential and glass pane constrain frost method, charging final archway image. Sensory integration (ozone scent, hum resonance) mirrors internal destabilization without overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (destabilize stasis) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via whisper-fueled frost overload narrowing to rupture. Agency in tracing sigils forecloses perfection with felt cost in library's transformation; one decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of change over stasis emerges organically from particulars; final image of pulsing buds offers resonant non-literal answer to eternity compression, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature: Operator's precise, economical noticing (spider-silk fingers, fractal sigils). Lyrical diction and rhythm modulate to crescendoing hum, enhancing pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion; varied rhythm suits accumulative build, climax metaphors ("implosion of meaning") purposeful without muddle. Minor overwriting density in frost description slightly dulls peak momentum before payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of frost-code, bottled whisper, and library implosion feels inevitable; bold premise transforms stasis trope through specific Operator actions, risking lyric compression that heightens closure.</comment>
