<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—aromatic caution versus seeking revelation—act in scene via trembling fingers under UV; final grief acceptance earned by prior sensory build with embodied tears as cost. Interiority particular via scent-tied grief, no stock epiphanies. Backstory anchors to present vial without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (humidity, scents) tightens to RR closure as bloom/scent triggers reconfiguration with legible emotional cost in "profound, cleansing sorrow." Orientation anchored early (Elias in greenhouse by para 1). Vial reveal and bloom form motivated ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting (UV lamps, condensation-slick glass) constrains vial experiment and charges final interplay of "crystal shadows... glowing blossom." Sensory hierarchy (scents over visuals) reflects POV urgency; details evolve causally with bloom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confront scent-memory) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative lens through vial word → bloom scent deepening knowledge/options; agency in UV test, cost in tears foreclosing resistance. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise at "breathed it all in."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memories transforming from "ambushes" to "relics" emerges organically via scent particulars; final image reweights premise non-literally as grief shifts from hollowing to cleansing without moralizing. Subtext in vial's hidden word charges irony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (shadows, phantom scents); rhythmic modulation peaks in bloom ("agonying slowness") without head-hopping. Voice distinct, biased diction fits wistful broker.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short bloom sentences propel); purposeful lyric metaphors ("petals the color of twilight") without muddle or loops in peak. Minor figurative density in opener but pattern-taught, no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinct scent, UV-hidden message transforms grief trope; risk in sensory arc inevitability pays off at bloom-grief hinge. No derivative echoes, bold crystal-shadows tone heightens without gimmick.</comment>
