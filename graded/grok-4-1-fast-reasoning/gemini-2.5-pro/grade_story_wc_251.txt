<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to tune silence via attribute is consistent and intensifies to compel the window climax; interiority concrete in hearing the "town’s collective subconscious... as a chord." Minor lack: no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the grotto retrieval or stone-cradling, tilting toward resolute action without embodied tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from library hush to synchronized displays, yielding Charged Poise closure in the "shift... from resignation to... curiosity" with defiance cost felt in collective gasp. Orientation anchored early; two shards transition legibly via grotto stone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto lodestone and stone constrain choice (retrieval enables focus) and charge final image ("faint, internal warmth"); cobalt library/mist filters through Elias's perceptual bias, narrowing to "unspoken gasp." Sensory hierarchy sharpens under prophecy urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seed doubt via displays) signaled early, tightens accumulatively at ninth bell with town-wide reveal narrowing Authority's hold; agency in organizing/cradling forces trade-off of exposure risk, cost legible in Maya's pivoting thought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of homogeny vs. textured lives emerges via particulars like braided loaf/gear/telescope, resonant in final "conversation that had just begun" reweighting prophecy without moral. Subtext in unspoken words invites ambiguity on rebellion's endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in "hearing... unspoken words... as a chord"; diction/rhythm modulate hush to blooming thoughts without slippage. Voice texture distinct in biased noticing (e.g., "forests of second thoughts").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences weave sensory/action (e.g., "cradle the stone... weaving... threads"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts dull closure image of warming stone. Minor figurative density coherent, not muddy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: telepathic coach's window network + grotto amplifier transforms dystopian trope via textural defiance; risk in "unvoiced doubts" pays off in Maya's "I can draw that," inevitable hindsight.</comment>
