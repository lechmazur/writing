<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and earned shift from Vienna hesitation to purpose, with micro-choices like tracing the pillbox revealing values; minor slip in overt epiphany ("the place his courage had been hiding") borders on unearned, but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with revelation tightening stakes (she's alive, network closing); on-page Charged Poise closure as Elias scuffs snow and turns with purpose, cost legible in past fracture now mended, constraint of ephemeral snow/map persistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist and snow constrain communication (vulnerable to breeze/sun) and charge final memorization; sensory hierarchy spy-specific (polished pillbox reflection for caution), vivid integration like "crunch of old snow" mirrors tension without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix Vienna failure via her location) signaled early, causal escalation via Kestrel's codes/vouchsafe narrows to Pyrenees action with agency in prudent wait/memorize/go; cost unmistakable in "fracture...he now had the chance to mend."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of mending fractures emerges organically from pillbox, snow map, and final talisman hold without statement; resonant reconfiguration in last image reweights courage as "waiting for the right war," lingering ambiguity of risk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (spy caution in reflection watch, scanning treeline); dialogue subtext-heavy ("You came") advances plot naturally; rhythmic control modulates from hush to dawn propulsion without slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "thumb traced...gravestone" advances character/atmosphere); figurative language coherent in lyric pattern without muddle, though minor density slips like stacked metaphors ("sharp enough to cut glass") in peak revelation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Snow codes transform dead-drop trope ingeniously, fitting spy grit with mist's ephemerality; fresh synthesis of lyricism and genre conventions in "strange dance" method heightens stakes organically.</comment>
