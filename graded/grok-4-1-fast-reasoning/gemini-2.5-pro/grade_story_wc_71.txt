<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses surface in her shift from "waking the spirit" to creating fissures, embodied in heart hammering and orris handling; realization earned via prior acts with visible cost in private conviction. Final choice to persist reconfigures her self-view holistically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from observations to displaced acts, culminating in CR realization ("She wasn’t waking the houses at all") with conceptual cost of her mission's true scope, legible in chain-reaction images.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring orris root and rock garden crunch constrain her desperate stoop act and charge realization scent; sensory hierarchy (salt-mud, violet-earth) mirrors her bias toward untidy life, evolving to next evening's lightness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fight sterility) tightens via cube-house desperation, narrowing to root placement with violation cost; agency in micro-rebellions drives pattern break, though abstract scale slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final images (flamingo contemplation, riot flowers) offer resonant non-literal answer to deadness vs. life, reweighting prior sterility motif without moralizing; emerges organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (houses' pulses, orris comfort); rhythmic modulation peaks in realization's cadence, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (e.g., "jagged piece... smelled of violets and damp earth"); minor figurative density (hushed blaze recurrence) coherent and pattern-taught, no loops dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of suburban sterility via displaced chaos transforms quiet-rebellion trope; flamingo/flowers chain reaction inevitable from orris anchor, bold risk in subtlety heightens stakes.</comment>
