<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the psychic link to Kael's warning versus Elara's push with the clipping, earning the final discovery with root-bound cost; interiority particular via "sap-slowed blood" and scars. Single-POV coherence exemplary under pressure. No diagnostic labels or tidy paths disrupt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ritual to clipping's heat, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("a single, shining thread had been pulled straight") with legible conceptual cost of frayed existence; orientation anchored in first paragraph. One tightening via warning deflection suffices; lens unambiguous at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt glade and weirwood constrain choices (roots fuse her, glade holds breath at climax), charging final permeable boundary image; sensory hierarchy (ozone, moonpetals via visionary bias) selective and purposeful. Body/roots as micro-setting mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (re-knit frayed edges) tightens accumulatively via Kael's spiral warning forcing clipping pivot, narrowing to vector path with felt endurance cost; agency in scar-tracing and sharing reconfigures options on-page. Escalation coheres under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of coherence from chaos emerges organically via clipping logic against dream-storm, resonant non-literal answer in "path...created" reweighting frayed premise without moralizing. Particulars like scars drive complexity; no tidy binaries or echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with visionary perceptual signature ("impossible colors," "shimmering...traceries"); rhythmic modulation heightens psychic vertigo to elation. No head-hopping or withholding; elision purposeful in dream-stuff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; metaphors coherent and voice-motivated (e.g., "lightning frozen on skin" in ritual beat). Minor figurative density in opening risks slight overwrite but spares peak; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal scars as link, clipping as chaos-key transforms fantasy tropes organically; risk in textural psychic fusion heightens stakes to inevitable hindsight vector. No derivatives or hedging; bold premise commits fully.</comment>
