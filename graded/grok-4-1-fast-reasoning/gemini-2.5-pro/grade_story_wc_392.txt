<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's watchfully calm precision fractures under lantern-induced visions, revealing contradictory impulses between empirical skepticism and vulnerable entanglement; final report defiance earns change via notebook discovery, foreclosing easy compliance with felt professional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as lantern visions and notebook accumulate to Conceptual Repricing closure; notebook find decisively reconfigures Finch's death from accident to obsession-driven, with defiance cost legible in "small act of defiance" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (wet earth, train hum vibrating bones) selectively narrow under empirical POV, with silt prints, scuff marks, and high-water mark constraining accident analysis; lantern as recurring object charges final "freedom but...cage" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (empirical truth vs. boss's simplification) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via visions escalating to notebook realization forcing defiant stance; cost visible in refusal to "sign it off," narrowing career compliance option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of entangled histories vs. flattened truths emerges organically from lantern's residual pull on Finch and Elias; final lantern image as "promised freedom but...become a cage" resonantly reweights obsession's peril without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of precise, measurement-driven noticing (e.g., "angle of Finch’s fall"); rhythmic modulation builds from calm observation to vulnerable intensity without filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action, sensory, and interiority without loops or scaffolds; varied syntax propels from "jolt went through him" to fading "echo of other people's memories," with clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms supernatural trope via empirical investigator's skeptical entanglement with Underground Railroad artifact; fresh synthesis of history's residual pull driving modern defiance feels inevitable in notebook payoff.</comment>
