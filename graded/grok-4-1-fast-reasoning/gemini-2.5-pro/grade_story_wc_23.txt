<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in daughter's loss drives precise micro-choices like slotting the censer foot, with embodied ache and tears showing contradictory endurance; minor reflective summary of calls slightly dilutes scene pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as calls build to full-moon placement and thrum, delivering Charged Poise closure with legible emotional cost in tears and unresolved ache; orientation anchors crisply in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station's defunct parts and gantry constrain building choices, while starlight and wind charge the rooftop final image; selective sensory hierarchy (thrum in bones, solid starlight) reflects Elias's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of building a grief-lighthouse tightens accumulatively via moon-fluctuating energy to activation, narrowing from personal loss to communal solace with felt cost of daughter's absence; agency clear in persistent construction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of homecoming amid irreversible loss emerges organically from reverse migration setup and final thrum image reweighting personal grief as raw comfort; no moralizing, resonance from particulars like censer hum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (geography of loss, shivering compass) modulates rhythmically under rising thrum; brief phone dialogue natural and cryptic, advancing stakes without subtext overload.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and purposeful metaphors (grinding stars, solid starlight) propel to closure without loops or drift; minor overwriting in opening patina description doesn't touch peak activation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc mysticism via censer-powered signal transforms navigator trope through moon-fluctuating grief-tech; risk-taking in poetic lens heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
