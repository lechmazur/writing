<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation intensifies through micro-choices like repositioning via watch pulses, embodied in trembling fingers during transcription; internal conflict emerges in cautious exuberance amid desperation. Final documentation of "Stay" earns a credible reconfiguration of her understanding. Minor abstraction in emotions like "painful" exuberance slightly tempers peak specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of motes and phrases toward CR closure with "Stay" pulsing as dying star light, cost legible in dissolving mist and still watch. Orientation anchors immediately in first paragraph; one tightening via central chamber glow suffices. Persistent watch constraint shapes all tactics without slippage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist and motes constrain choreography, narrowing perception to propagation delays that charge final "Stay" image; body as micro-setting via palm-held watch and veil diffusing light integrates purposefully. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency, filtering through dreamer's bias. No white-room; spatial coherence tracks moves cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find unspoken words before second letter) tightens accumulatively via transcribed phrases converging on central glow, forcing stance crystallization in final clearing step. Agency in documenting forecloses time path with felt cost (thinning mist). One deepening suffices; visible price in frantic watch alters final positioning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth in delayed arrival emerges organically from cipher events, reweighted by "Stay" as non-literal answer to silence's architecture without moralizing. Final image clutches journal amid dissolving library, resonating regret's cost. Particulars like reversed watch avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in facing messenger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with dreamlike perceptual signature (light as page, motes as ghosts) modulates rhythm under pressure, compressing at climax. Voice texture distinct in syntax like "cyclically reversed sweep"; no head-hopping, inference matches knowledge. Prose as character reflects veiled urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, e.g., short pulses amid transcription; metaphors cohere in light-delay pattern without muddle. Minor scaffold in repeated "mist" anchors avoided loops. Opening anchors stakes; final line recharges watch motif propulsively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise transforms library trope into physics-of-regret cipher, synthesized via watch's reversal enabling irreplaceable turns; "propagation delays" inflect offers fresh angle on silence. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at "Stay" CR. No derivative echoes.</comment>
