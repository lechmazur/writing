<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Celeste's motivation roots deeply in observant traits, shown via concrete retrieval of the nib and phone call under pressure; micro-choices like circling the telescope reveal hierarchy of values. Internal conflict emerges in balancing public scandal with private sorrow, embodied in "heart a steady, solemn drum." Final intervention earns closure via prior causality without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: journalist's call triggers nib retrieval → proof-by-contradiction call dismantling narrative → reconfiguration of truth. Orientation anchors immediately in observatory post-call. Closure via CR in final image ("painful orbit complete") with emotional cost legible in "for the first time, she felt her father was finally among them."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory details selective and purposeful: "hum of the dome's rotation," "curved glass wall," constrain solitude and reflection, mirroring internal orbits. Nib as micro-object charges final image, held "cool against her palm" against clouds/stars. Sensory hierarchy fits POV's astronomical lens without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth, protect legacy) signaled early, tightens via causal questions narrowing journalist's options ("why did the bulk... reappear?"). Agency in precise dismantling forecloses lie's path with felt cost (inheritance sold). Escalation peaks in journalist's stunned breathing, charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths vs. surface lies emerges organically through contradiction cascade, reweighting regret's orbits without statement. Final image offers resonant CR: father's "orbit complete," recharging prior metaphors with emotional cost. Subtext in nib's "unwritten narrative" avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: astronomical diction ("orbits," "gravitational pull") biases noticing. Dialogue natural, goal-driven with subtext ("solemn playfulness"); journalist's stammer advances plot. Rhythm modulates tension in call without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwrite in opening metaphors ("satellites of sorrow," "planet tethered") slightly muddles pre-climax propulsion. No loops or scaffolds; closure image crisp ("sea of white clouds obscured... stars traced perfect paths"). Propulsion aligns with causal beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: logical "proof by contradiction" phone defense transforms family-scandal trope via observatory orbits metaphor. Risk in solemn-playful tone heightens emotional stakes organically. Final nib image inevitable in hindsight, no derivative echoes.</comment>
