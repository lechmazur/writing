<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength in embodied grief release tying personal motivation to father's stasis paradox; Mortimer's vague presence as death-persona adds intrigued curiosity without deepening relational pressure, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via discovery density to CR closure in "their release not an act of violence, but a simple, final exhale," with legible conceptual cost of infinite energy vs. entropy; orientation anchored early in submersible approach.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Library micro-setting constrains manipulator actions and charges snow globe reprise; "books floated in lazy suspension, their pages swollen into pale, indecipherable flowers" vividly embodies preservation theme without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding letting go tightens via strongbox opening and note reveal under accumulative lens; cost legible in "perfect preservation that was also a state of perfect stasis," but lacks single decisive agency turn narrowing options further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of holding vs. releasing emerges organically from particulars like the globe's "gilded cage," offering non-literal resonant answer in narrator's lighter griefs; no moralizing, complexity in father's success-as-failure lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature ("crushing pressure of the deep, both literal and existential") modulates elegantly; single murmured line to Mortimer feels natural, voice coherent under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in "pried open the library's warped bronze doors," varied rhythm; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "pale, indecipherable flowers" slightly dulls peak reveal without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh quantum sanctuary in snow globe transforms sunken ship trope, Earhart fluke adds ingenuity; risk in esoteric physics payoff feels inevitable from analytic drive, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
