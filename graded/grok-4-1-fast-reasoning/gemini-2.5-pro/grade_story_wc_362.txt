<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory mystic/grounded impulses act in the experiment setup and prism handling; final realization earned by causal buildup with visible conceptual cost in "earth beneath him was now made of broken steel."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to on-page CR closure; cost legible in "His entire theory... proven horribly, clinically correct" as premise reweights literally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frosted windshield and prism constrain the light experiment choice and charge final schematic image; selective sensory vividness (feathery ice, pulsing colors) mirrors revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove emotional absorption) deepens via agency in positioning/commune, reweighting knowledge with unmistakable conceptual cost in bolt diagram.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of literal object memories emerges organically from prism reveal; final image ("tiny vessel of a cold, mechanical truth") resonantly reweights "truthful lie" premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (mystic-scientist lens on light/frost); rhythmic modulation heightens pressure in revelation beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops; purposeful figurative language ("spear of pale light... exploding into a rainbow") integrates in peak without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystic science with literal mechanical twist transforms grief trope; risk in CR revelation feels inevitable from grounded setup.</comment>
