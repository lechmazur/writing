<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in grandfather's legacy, compelling micro-choices like crushing the grain; embodied melancholy ("beautiful ache that would linger") earns endurance with felt cost. Minor label-speak ("purposefully curious ache") slightly genericizes interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to blooms, pattern breaks at sunrise for Conceptual Repricing closure; cost legible in "image... seared behind his eyes, a memory far more vivid than any film." Single scene, orientation anchored early, no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Suit heaters groaning against profound cold constrains waiting; summit evolves from moonlit hush to barren sterility, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (crunch of regolith, vibrating stillness) POV-specific and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (photograph blooms for legacy) signaled early, tightens via lure reaction to hundreds blooming then instant extinction; agency in chemical setup forecloses path with emotional cost in "profound, dawnlit melancholy." One decisive intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fleeting beauty/extinction emerges organically from blooms' "communal farewell" and sublimation; final image reweights legacy as indelible ache without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature on light/silence ("dawning hush... world held its breath"); rhythmic control modulates from anticipatory hush to reverent thump-clack.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel to climax; no loops/artifacts, though minor overwriting in "intricate, fractal patterns of light, pulsing with a gentle, internal energy" risks purple but stays coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi legacy (spore-catalyst luring crystalline blooms) transforms extinction trope; risk in chemical timed message heightens stakes organically.</comment>
