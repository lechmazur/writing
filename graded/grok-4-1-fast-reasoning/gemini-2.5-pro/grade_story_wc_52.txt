<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (dwell vs. harvest) act vividly in memory selection and carving choice; final renunciation of whole-man containment earned via "crystallized time" with embodied cost in steady hand amid whistling kettle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory density tightens to carving cut (DC/RR), reconfiguring grief with legible cost in "silence that rushed back in was deeper"; orientation anchored early in loft/rain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rain-kettle-ash triad constrains timing/choices and charges final image ("fresh-cut ash" mingling scents); sensory hierarchy (sounds guide inward, smells anchor Leo) POV-biased and evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest/contain lesson) signaled early, deepens via cub-memory reversal under Accumulative lens, forcing carving agency with cost in foreclosed "whole man"; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final "arc of profound stillness" offers resonant answer to control-as-presence, reweighting loss via carving image without moralizing; theme emerges organically from memory-carve particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with perceptual signature (scent/sound bias, grief-tinged lyricism); rhythmic control modulates from rain-drumming to post-whistle hush, compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pressed the blade... arc of profound stillness" advances action/theme); varied rhythm, coherent metaphors ("bottle a storm"); no loops/artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lion-tamer grief into "crystallized time" carving ritual transforms widow trope; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
