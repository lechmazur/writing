<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (ruthless drought-maker vs. trembling hands cradling egg) act simultaneously, earning the penance act; final renunciation feels compelled by boyhood memory haunting his pragmatism. Interiority concrete and particular, no epiphanies. Flaw complicates without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from navigation to basin release, culminating in CR (egg dissolution reconfigures lineage as microbial echo) with legible cost in "quiet, hollow resonance." Orientation anchored immediately via salt flat drive. Single scene, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Salt crystals biting knees and geothermal brine constrain kneeling/placement choices; vent's "sulfurous warmth" and "corrosive brine" charge final dissolution image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (cracks as arteries he bled). No white-room; lived-in tactile navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (penance via egg release) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through retrieval/kneeling to foreclose via dissolution; agency in gentle placement bears "hollow" cost. Thunder lull tightens expectant pressure without reversal need. Cost unmistakable in post-act turn away.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image (echo in salt/water/heat amid thunder-rain promise) resonantly reweights drought-baron premise without moralizing; theme emerges organically from biochemistry apology vs. broken world. No tidy resolution, embraces ambiguity of unfelt forgiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (patterns in cracks, phantom birdsong); rhythmic modulation heightens intensity at "pearlescent colors bleeding." Prose texture distinct: lyrical diction biased to geological/biological intimacy. No elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "calligraphy of cracks" multi-job: plot/setting/voice); no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle—lyric pattern taught early pays off at closure bloom. Propulsion varies rhythmically, zero artifacts dulling release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: drought-baron's microbial penance transforms eco-villain trope via specific egg-vent logic; risk in quiet CR closure heightens stakes. Irreplaceable final "hollow resonance" feels inevitable from thrush-memory seed.</comment>
