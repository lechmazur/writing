<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in Elara's protected care versus Kaelen's resignation culminate in his earned breath shift ("first that didn’t sound like a prelude to shattering"), revealing hierarchy of values with relational cost; interiority particular via moss-tending bias. Kaelen's passivity borders on endurance without full agency test, but prior causality supports stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from drip tracking to pattern reveal, yielding Charged Poise closure when Kaelen closes fingers on pendant amid "fertile ground" hush; cost legible in foreclosed fossilization path. Single scene adheres to defaults; orientation anchored early via server farm/moss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Slate drip pattern as micro-setting constrains climax choice and charges final image, mirroring microprocessor failure to growth; sensory hierarchy (hush, petrichor, moss velvet) reflects Elara's priorities, evolving causally with thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grafting meaning onto Kaelen's viral failure) signaled early, tightens via pattern deepening that narrows fossil vs. flow options under Accumulative lens; agency in proffer forces crystallization with felt relational/emotional cost in his tightened jaw then releasing breath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of rust-to-life emerges organically from moss on servers, drip delta/microprocessor, pendant gnat; final image reweights failure premise via "choice she had just given him," resonant without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of new hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with Elara's perceptual signature (moss as biome, patterns in water); rhythmic modulation peaks in quiet proffer beat; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You don’t have to be the fossil"), advances closure without declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "drip, drip, drip... patient metronome" advances time/atmosphere/stakes); coherent metaphors avoid muddle, rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwrite in opening hush/weight cluster slightly dulls early propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data center moss garden transforms failure tropes via thawing icicle microprocessor pattern; risk in lyric Accumulative build heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight pendant/drip reconfiguration.</comment>
