<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Locksmith's motivation to free ideas is clear and intensifies through focused intent, compelling the humming choice; woman's grief embodies via whisper and tears. Interiority concrete but leans poetic over raw contradiction. Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, with release earning change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to closure via RR (hair dissolving into motes, music released). Orientation anchored early in workshop and client problem. Cost legible in "profound release" chord and woman's relief, reconfiguring fear's hold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus and starlight constrain choices, with light filtered through hair projecting lattice on stone to enable method. Sensory vivid (ozone tang, chord echo) and purposeful. Final image of stones as "just a circle" recharges setting's magic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free trapped music) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via lattice confusion to ribbon untying. Agency in humming narrows options with deepening resonance. Cost felt in fear's dissolution, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of idea-liberation emerges organically from starlight method and release, with final drifting symphony as non-literal answer reweighting fear's cage. Subtext in gentle dissolution vs. direct assault avoids tidy morals. Particulars like lock of hair shift meaning richly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in cosmic noticing (ley lines, star resonance). Rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, distinct from woman's sparse speech. No head-hopping; elision of backstory taught early and paid in release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short expectant sentences to rich chord echo). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; figurative language purposeful in peak dissolution beat. Propulsion peaks cleanly at "frayed ribbon...untied itself."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of metaphysical locksmith using starlight disorientation transforms trope organically. Risky lyrical fantasy heightens stakes via improbable method succeeding. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from established pattern.</comment>
