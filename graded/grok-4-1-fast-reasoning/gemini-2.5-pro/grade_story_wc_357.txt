<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through micro-choices like banking into the water flow and extending the drone under time pressure; embodied sensations (humming in teeth/bones) ground interiority. Solo POV limits relational crucible but shows competence balanced with struggle (racing gravity). Final shard collection feels earned without contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Inversion enables water path (because), arrow guides to cavern (therefore), time pressure forces quick shard shear with legible cost ("only minutes"; "racing the re-emerging river"). Orientation anchored early ("ochre soil of the orchard planet"). On-page DC closure with persistent constraint (gravity timer).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (thrum, dust motes upward, levitating droplets) filters through pilot's priorities, constraining choices (navigating arches via inverted river). Central cavern geode and pulsing crystal charge final image, mirroring internal quest. World rules consistent via action (floating fish, seed growth).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find resilience source) signaled early, tightens causally via arrow's hum to cavern and gravity deadline narrowing options. Protagonist agency in drone extension forecloses safe exit path with visible cost (shuddering skiff, racing river). One decisive escalation suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience as "gathering of echoes" emerges organically from seed pod transformation and final realization ("not a simple cure... planet's memory of strength"). Closing image reweights premise without moralizing, tying character arc to planetary renewal. Subtext in arrow relic's purpose lingers ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (pilot's focus on navigation amid silence); diction modulates rhythmically with intensity ("soundless noise grew stronger"). No head-hopping or withholding; purposeful compression in high-stakes flight enhances propulsion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates action, sensation, atmosphere without loops; rhythm varies (short urgent sentences in cavern: "She cut the engines..."). Figurative language purposeful ("whirling silence," "weightless ballet") without muddle in peak beats. Minor scaffold absent; clean propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity inversion, inverted river navigation, and life-force crystal transforms tropes into organic quest; arrow relic's dual halves offer hindsight inevitability. Bold sci-fi ingenuity (Anechoic Heart as echo-gathering) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
