<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's haunting optimism shows in contradictory impulses—unconscious dream-sewing vs. conscious storm-anchoring with bleeding hands—earning the final endurance; interiority particular via "orchid solace blooming in the sterile air."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: thread density builds to storm cadence shift, yielding Charged Poise closure as threads hum post-storm with Kaelen's felt cost (bleeding hands); orientation anchored early in wharf weaver amid canyon silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Red canyon walls and crimson dust constrain choices—alcove yields plate, rock anchors threads against storm; sensory selection (dust scouring, taut humming) mirrors transformation, charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve dream-art) signaled via plate-inspired hope, tightens via storm forcing agency (conscious knots), with visible cost (bleeding hands altering tactics); escalation coheres accumulatively to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of reweaving ruin to reverence emerges via particulars (sleep-threads to storm-anchored map), final image resonantly reconfigures "tomb" to "cradle" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (optimistic bias: "strange and fragile hope"); voice texture modulates rhythmically from dusty silence to resonant hum, purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image integration (e.g., "shimmering line tracing a path"); minor figurative density in opening desolation but no loops or muddle touching storm peak or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesizes post-sea fabulism (sleep-collective weaving precedents) into inevitable transformation; risk of poetic method heightens stakes, fresh via kelp-rope knots securing dream-threads.</comment>
