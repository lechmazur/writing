<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's obsession with mathematical perfection clashes with life's messiness, embodied in tracing the nautilus then dropping it; Kael's confession forces her pivot to emotional alchemy, earning the sun's transformation with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds emotional density to CR closure in the living sun's bloom and shared glance; nautilus drop makes before/after legible with felt cost of renouncing sterility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ember Nexus twilight with crystalline dust and vesper crickets mirrors fading energies, charging Kael's confession; nautilus and sun as micro-settings constrain her initial rigidity and final infusion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to capture presence tightens accumulatively via confession, forcing heart over math; agency in ignoring nautilus and pouring grief forecloses perfectionism with visible tear-cost image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of math-vs-heart emerges implicitly through failed sun to living gold; final shared glance reweights presence as relational, not formulaic, with resonant ambiguity in Kael's tear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable Elara POV with alchemical perceptual bias modulates to emotional compression; Kael's whisper "I'm leaving" carries subtextual pressure, distinct from her introspective idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythmic prose varies with scene urgency, dense without loops; "swirled with motes of amber and deep russet, chaotic and alive" propels closure image crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pocket-sun alchemy synthesizing sterile math and human emotion transforms epiphany trope; risky poetic density heightens stakes in the improvised sun without gimmickry.</comment>
