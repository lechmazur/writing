<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Steadfast pacifism roots motivation in acceptance over violence, compelling higher-stakes integration of her own grief in the final photo; embodied emotions (heaviness crushing, lightness euphoric) show contradictory impulses acting in scene. Final compassion to child-self earns closure change with visible cost. Minor therapy-speak ("shadow work") embodied enough not to flatten.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: photo-by-photo density builds to pattern-break cadence at own-image processing, yielding Charged Poise RR closure as aperture parts with acceptance-cost felt in ship-shudder and total lightness. Orientation anchored early (Scrap-Ark, sole steward). No lens ambiguity; persistent photo/tear constraint shapes tactics to finale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recycled spaceship groans/contracts in sympathy, constraining via buckling fear and microgravity floats that enable core cycle; body lightness as micro-setting charges final dome-lift. Sensory selection (cool Tear, grated plates) purposeful, POV-biased to ritual. Environment mirrors internal states through action (sinking presses to floor).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (open dimension) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening sorrow-density per photo, culminating in own-grief tightening that forecloses fighting-despair path with on-page cost (crushing desolation integrated). Agency in welcoming pain narrows options. Cost unmistakable in shuddering ship and sacred-trust acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Acceptance-as-compassion theme emerges organically from stitching sorrows into tapestry, reweighted non-literally in final whisper-open aperture offering healed humanity. Particulars (saline crystals, silver knots) build resonance without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question of despair's weight vs. integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-POV, perceptual signature via lightness physics and ghostly diction ("jagged edges," "airy vessel"); rhythm modulates with pressure (short ritual beats to expansive finale). Purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (sinking/floating cadences build propulsion); high density with images advancing stakes (leadens weight floods, silver knots pulse). Minor figurative density in peaks ("needle thin as whisper") coherent, pattern-taught without muddle. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-human vigil, crystallized compassion unlocking dimension via tear-stitched photos transforms isolation tropes through physics-of-emotion and pacifist shadow-work. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at buoyant closure. Bold conceptual integrity without retreat.</comment>
