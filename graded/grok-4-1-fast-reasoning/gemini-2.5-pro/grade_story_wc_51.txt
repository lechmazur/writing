<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solitary endurance of Kaelen's motivation shines through concrete micro-choices like thumbing the wick-raiser amid psychic ache, rooting traits in his boundary-less trap. Interiority particularized in "whalebone reverie," embodied without clichés. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, tilting toward competent isolation over raw conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sorrow wisp accumulates into stone via layered process, taught early in grotto hush. On-page closure as Charged Poise in kneeling amid deepened silence, cost legible in "lonely warden... waiting for the next weight." Orientation anchored in opening lines; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bronze grotto and starlight (Alphena sliver) constrain choice, forging wisp in pivotal alignment beat. Sensory hush layers tactilely via "shingled presences," mirroring internal states through action. Micro-setting of burner as tool charges final mosaic image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to collect/transform burdens signaled early, tightens accumulatively via wisp's frantic pulse slowing to lattice. Agency in orienting/calcifying forecloses chaos with entrapment cost felt in relief echo and kneeling. Minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of pain's transmutation into weighted silence emerges organically from stone mosaic growth, reweighting solitude without statement. Final image of "infinitesimally heavier, deeper" offers resonant CR to warden's premise. Particulars like tear-shaped stone avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in layered silences and psychic currents; diction/rhythm poetic yet controlled, modulating to hum's disturbance. No head-hopping; voice coheres as Kaelen's boundary-less mind. Perceptual bias filters world through sorrow-net.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion via dense images like "starlight pierced... low hum vibrated." Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("ice-cold streams," "shard of glass") borders coherence slip in process beat, but purposeful for textural lens. No loops; high density advances closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sorrow-weaving via starlit burner transforms alchemical trope into inevitable warden's stasis. Risky lyric compression heightens entrapment stakes, recharging hush motif organically. Non-obvious "fractal weaver" premise feels singular.</comment>
