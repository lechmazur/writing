<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in "sharp, crystalline shard of his guilt began to soften," with contradictory guilt and kindness impulses acting in the bluff climax; final endurance earned by lace deciphering causality, confronting flaws without tidy erasure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as remembrance density breaks with compass steadying at "trembling, and pointed... straight down," yielding RR closure (diffusion reconfigures grief) with legible cost in persisting "brutal concentration... spread[ing] like ink in water."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bluff granite and tide/wind constrain climax timing ("wind turning to push against the incoming tide"); recurring juniper charges final image of "hand that now knew how to shape... the silence."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigate sorrow) signaled early, deepens via agency in holding compass at peak, foreclosing drowning grief with felt price in "memories did not vanish"; lens escalation via cadence shift to "gentle, rhythmic swell."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of diffused (not erased) apologies emerges from lace/compass particulars; final shears image non-literally answers "color of unspoken apologies" via "regret... transmuted into... contemplation," reweighting without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases to melancholic sea/sky ("cerulean regret"); rhythmic control modulates from dense reflection to sparse closure image, with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density in lines like "Each cut was a question asked of the silence"; varied rhythm propels without loops or muddle, ear-test clean even in peak "warmth spreading... entire body."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lace-as-map and inward-pointing compass synthesize grief navigation freshly; risk of lyric stasis heightens via charged diffusion, inevitable in hindsight from "language of knots and threads."</comment>
