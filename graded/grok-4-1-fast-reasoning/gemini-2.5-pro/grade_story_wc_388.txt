<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to excavate truth drives consistent, observant choices like noting the orchard's uniformity and reassembling letters, earning the final discovery. Interiority concrete via professional lens, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or embodied emotional friction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via discovery chain: observation → reassembly → alignment → stillpoint reveal as Conceptual Repricing. Closure cost legible in "one more lie had been carefully excavated and replaced with a fact," reconfiguring superstition into physics. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via intuition suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Derelict station and orchard-dust perimeter constrain actions, with antenna climb and mossy earth enabling climax. Final image of rustling leaves amid dust-free wind charges closure under causal lens. Sensory details selective through Kaelen's observant bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (excavate truth) signaled early tightens causally via reassembly revelation narrowing to alignment test. Intuiting light focus as agency forecloses folklore option with intellectual cost paid on-page. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth supplanting comfortable lies emerges organically from myth-to-physics arc, resonating in final orchard image reweighting the premise. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in locals' unshown reaction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of precise, scientific noticing (e.g., "flaw... asymmetrical lattice"). Prose rhythm modulates from methodical to revelatory; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with every line advancing knowledge or image; varied syntax propels from setup to peak without loops or scaffolds. Clean, specific diction like "greasy smear" heightens without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc orchard anomaly as engineered physics protected by seeded myth; diamond-as-lens turn inevitable from particulars. Risks quiet CR closure effectively.</comment>
