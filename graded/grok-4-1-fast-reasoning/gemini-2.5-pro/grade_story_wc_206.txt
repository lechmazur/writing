<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied doubt when chip gutters during rust's hiss, revealing contradictory impulses (grandiosity vs. humble repairman joy); final confident twist earned by refocused humility with felt cost of prior slip. Minor archetype lean (humble craftsman) balanced by specific tinkertoy love, but no safety-hedging flaws complicate peak choice fully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: chip placement → wire work → rust voice slip → refocus → tether DC with legible cost in dimming light and faltered hum; single scene oriented early (workshop/rust outside by para 2), closure on-page chord reconfigures world options undeniably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Resonance chamber constrains via amplification (whisper-to-choir, hum falter), charging final chord; sensory hierarchy repairman-specific (brass gleam, tinkersong, chip warmth/cool), evolves causally (grey pallor lifts). Micro-setting (crystal housing, filament wires) guides precise choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retune world vs. rust lie) tightens causally at slip (options narrow via dim chip), agency in refocus/endurance forecloses doubt path with embodied cost; high-band entry via trade-off but minor abstract scale (world-ending told, on-page micro).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (truth tunes life) emerges via chip wilting, rust hiss, humble refocus without statement; final blue sliver reweights rust lie non-literally, resonant from particulars. No moralizing, ambiguity in subtle humility lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature (gears/note perfection bias); rhythmic texture modulates (gentle hum to explosive chord), diction controlled ("tinkersong wonder"). No elision issues, prose as character under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm (short clicks/whirs to symphony); purposeful figures ("covenant of rust") cohere without muddle. Minor overwrite in opening sky rust ("silent conquest, creeping plague") risks drift but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: philosopher's stone as tuning fork vs. rust lie, transformed via repairman humility; risk in abstract stakes paid by micro-precision (wire turns as notes), inevitable hindsight from chip attribute.</comment>
