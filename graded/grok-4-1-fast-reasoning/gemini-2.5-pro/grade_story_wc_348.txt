<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—chemical logic versus missed poetry—act in observations, earning final reconfiguration via foam insight with embodied chest-knot loosening as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build to CR closure; river foam "slow, widening dawn" reweights rigid-family premise with undeniable emotional cost in chrysalis touch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>River foam and granite slab constrain insight choice, charging final "nave of a cathedral" image through chemist-filtered sensory details like "wet stone and pollen."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Foam patterns deepen dominant stake of connection, forcing renunciation of permanence via accumulative pressure; loosened grief forecloses prior path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>River braiding image resonantly answers divergence question, reweighting polymers/rift motif without literal statement or moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Chemist perceptual signature—"enzymatic breakdown," "polymerization in real time"—biases noticing consistently under reflective pressure, with stable single-POV distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm; foam passage integrates metaphors without muddle or loops, passing read-aloud test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Foam-polymer synthesis transforms atonement trope through specific chemist lens, risking lyric reflection for fresh relational reconfiguration.</comment>
