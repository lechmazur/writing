<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's embodied sorrow (heart as "fractured thing") contradicts with professional curiosity, compelling micro-choices like gentle unfurling; final hopeful endurance earned without epiphany, visible in ceremonial sleeving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: dust anomaly to button drop to embossed message tightens discovery density toward CR closure; cost legible in "ache... shifted, making room," reconfiguring personal loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dust patterns and "decaying paper and binder's glue" constrain careful handling, charging button reveal; post-emancipation specificity filters through archivist bias, mirroring internal fracture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (magnify kindnesses amid sorrow) deepens via layered discoveries under accumulative lens, narrowing to emotional reweighting; button's fall forces stance shift with felt cost in shifted ache.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Clerk's fold reconfigures sundered families into "stubbornly tucked" love, resonant CR inextricable from Elara's arc; final shelves image answers without moral, embracing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with archivist perceptual signature ("sharp, clean line broke the grey veil"); rhythmic modulation peaks at crackle sympathy, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density in "paper crackled in protest, a sound that made her own broken heart ache"; varied rhythm propels without overwriting in reveal beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Button-in-fold as clerk's rebellion transforms hidden-history trope into century-spanning empathy; inevitable synthesis risks quiet lyricism without gimmick.</comment>
