<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's dynamically observant trait enables pivotal pattern-reading in flutters; final resolve to sculpt possibility earned via layered realizations with embodied laugh and fist-uncurl; minor abstraction in backstory "never" foundation slightly distances peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from glass flake cue to flutter code realization; Charged Poise closure via fiddle-playing reconfigures "never" with conceptual cost of embracing impossibility; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fluttering mesh constrains choice as visual code-map charging final play; ozone-pine-ozone and glass shard tactilely mirror digital-analog fracture; sensory hierarchy musician-specific via rhythm-seeking eyes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to solidify vanishing memory tightens via flutter-decoding reversal, narrowing to play-the-secret agency; cost legible in foreclosed "never" endurance; single deepening suffices under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of impossible doors emerges organically from Lyra's exit to Elias's fiddle-cadence; final image reweights "never" ashes non-literally without moralizing; ambiguity in amnesty lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (rhythm in flutters, glitching music) biases musician POV consistently; purposeful compression taught early pays in closure poise; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring emotional crescendo; figurative overlay (grid of iridescent squares) purposeful without muddle; minor stem repetition in observations contained pre-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh digital-analog synthesis (collodion flake, pixel amnesty, flutter code) transforms vanishing trope via fiddler lens; risk in lyric code-reading heightens stakes organically to charged end.</comment>
