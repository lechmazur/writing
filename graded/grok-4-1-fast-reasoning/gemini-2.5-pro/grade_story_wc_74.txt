<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in doubt "creep[ing] in, cold and sharp" clashing with "stubborn fire," driving micro-choice to display canvases; final reconfiguration earned with embodied cost in hammering heart and shuddering breath. Voice-specific perception (counting ochre shades) avoids stock phrasing. No safety-hedging in flawed hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: paintings accumulate symbols, tightening to display act; closure as Charged Poise in lights' response reconfigures doubt with felt cost of prolonged silence. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (rooftop greenhouse, pre-dawn smog). Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse's "humid, clean air" contrasts smog-choked city, constraining display from ledge and charging final image of symbols blazing into chasm. Sensory hierarchy (moonlight on philodendrons, terracotta floor) POV-biased toward painterly light. Spatial choreography tracks precisely to precipice overlook.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove kindness remembered) signaled early, escalates via hour of silence deepening doubt before lights tighten to Charged Poise; agency in flicking switches forecloses isolation path with cost of "vast and profound" silence. One meaningful cadence shift sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of dormant kindness lexicon emerges organically from symbols ('shelter freely given') to final reprise of crude 'witness' reply, reweighting premise without moralizing. Resonance in "nascent stars" image invites ambiguity of scale. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in painterly diction ("saffron quiet," "moon-tipped brush... drink the meager moonlight"); stable close-3rd POV with no leakage, modulating rhythm to peak stress (short sentences in doubt hour). Prose texture reflects insomniac mind without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., brush description advances motivation/tool); rhythmic variety in read-aloud (long descriptive opens to punchy "Then, it happened"). Minor overwriting in opening metaphors, but purposeful/lyric without muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of insomniac visions into city-broadcast symbols transforms trope of urban alienation; risk in abstract glyphs rousing metropolis pays off in hindsight-inevitable response pattern. No template echoes; bold rooftop display heightens stakes organically.</comment>
