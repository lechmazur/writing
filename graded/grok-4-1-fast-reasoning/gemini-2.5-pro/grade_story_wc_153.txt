<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's resolve despite depletion embodies fierce tenderness, with micro-choices like pressing the shard revealing values under pressure; Kael's reaction shows earned change. Minor slip: internal conflict more stated than simultaneous impulses in pivotal evocation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from setup to evocation, culminating in CR closure via dissolving "*sorry*" and Kael's weeping, with Elara's sway as legible cost in final lines. Orientation anchored early in stilt-hut; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mangrove roots, humid pane, and shard constrain choices (pressed to glass) and charge final image (shard angled to moon). Sensory selection (keening hymn, chill) reflects urgency; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evoke pre-decision moment) signaled early, textural escalation via swelling spirits and mist revelation narrows to understanding; Elara's agency in whispering name drives deepening, cost in her hollowing out unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken regret emerges organically via fragmented words and vision; final shard-to-moon image offers resonant repricing of "mending" without moralizing, reweighting initial labyrinth stillness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in poetic biases (e.g., "stones rubbing together underwater"); voice modulates rhythmically under pressure, elision purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative layering (e.g., "tidal pull of memory") dense in evocation peak without muddle; minor recurrence of "heavy" avoided as purposeful pattern, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of medium's condensation ritual transforms regret tropes; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, with gargoyle shard's evolving role feeling inevitable to closure.</comment>
