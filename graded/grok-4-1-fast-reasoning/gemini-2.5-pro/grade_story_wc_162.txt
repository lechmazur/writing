<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (homeward pull vs. sacred finality) act in scene through grain-tracing and threshold approach; final renunciation earned by causal chain of symbol-decoding, with chest-chill embodying cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern-teaching (grain spirals to logbook symbols to light sequence); CR closure lands on-page with conceptual cost of permanent distance legible in threshold vibration and final platform image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace and wood grain constrain choices (northern point, symbol decoding) and charge final chair image; sensory selection (agitated whorls, prismatic flares) mirrors urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sacred thresholds) tightens via prediction sequence under Accumulative lens, narrowing to agency in crossing; cost felt in "fundamental rule" vibration, though lacks one micro-turn complicating resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of necessary distances emerges organically from wood memories, spatial shears, and final analysis reprise; ending image reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of chosen separation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (storm-memory grains, volatile skies) biases noticing; rhythmic compression heightens under stress (desperation-born speed), with stable single-POV and no elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (violet pulse to green shimmer); figurative language pattern-taught early without muddle in peak (threshold step), though minor synonym churn in "wooden" recurrences dulls propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corn-maze inheritance, weather-coded realities, and grain-navigation transforms butterfly-effect trope; risk in lyric compression inevitable in hindsight, charging CR without gimmickry.</comment>
