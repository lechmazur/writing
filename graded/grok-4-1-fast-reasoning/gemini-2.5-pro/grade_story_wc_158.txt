<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied in "photosynthesize pain into beauty," with contradictory impulses of longing and awe acting in the shift to truce; final endurance of wakefulness earned via prior isolation causality, foreclosing conquest with serene cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sorrow builds to pattern break at "blossom armistice," delivering Conceptual Repricing closure when postcard is ensconced, reweighting premise with undeniable acceptance cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shell and postcard as micro-settings constrain choices (amplifies whispers, niches poem) and charge final pearlescent crevice image; sensory selection (salt-damp air, soughed wind) purposeful and POV-biased toward poetic isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming pain signaled early, escalates via texture shift ("sand grinding into a pearl") that deepens under accumulative lens, forcing harmony renunciation with legible cost in un-trembling hands at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of pain-bloomed beauty emerges organically from garden/reef images shifting at postcard ensconcement; final new sound offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting sorrow with reef-shadow joy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (cosmic dust as "bruise") stable in single POV, modulating rhythm to match emotional cadence; purposeful poetic compression taught early and legible at serene vigil closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but minor figurative density in opening ("nacrous walls," "calcium cathedral") borders overwrite without obscuring closure image of pearlescent crevice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shell-poet premise transformed via "blossom armistice" and pain-photosynthesis; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, with postcard turn inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
