<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction between rational denial and yearning faith, embodied in trowel digging and tooth-holding; final charting choice earned by prior micro-hesitations. No diagnostic speak; flaws drive inevitable self-forgiveness arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: digging cue → box/tooth discovery → note realization → constellation charting as CR closure with emotional cost of "irreparable cleft" legible in final image. Orientation anchored early in maze/garden; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hedge maze and wilting moon-petal roses constrain digging choice and charge reflective isolation; sensory details (clink, pearlescent glow) POV-filtered via bone-setter's tactile priorities. Subtle mirroring of internal fracture without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rational certainty vs. folklore faith) signaled early, deepens decisively at tooth/note with knowledge shift narrowing denial option; cost felt in "chasm" and self-forgiveness trade-off charging final image under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bone-fracture motif emerges organically from particulars, reweighting skepticism in final constellation image as non-literal answer to doubt-without-proof; ambiguity lingers in "terrifying mistake" without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in medical metaphors (e.g., "clean, satisfying snap"); rhythmic modulation heightens realization without filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor figurative density (e.g., stacked metaphors in reflection block) slightly overwrites peak tooth moment without obscuring closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling lore via bone-setter's fracture metaphors transforms skepticism trope; final "nostalgic innovation" constellation turn feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
