<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Julian's embodied grief (sweaty palm, gasping apology) and Vex's pragmatic pressure earn the final lighter chest; contradictory impulses peak in the deluge without tidy epiphany. Voice distinction shines in Vex's idiom vs. Julian's whispers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (hum, lilac, embers) builds to RR closure in imperfect acceptance; cost legible in "fractured and painful absolution" before diesel growl. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Archive constrains ritual timing ("before the very ground...is torn up"), charges closure via fading lilac and distant chainsaws; sensory hierarchy (ozone over dust) filters through Julian's regret.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (apology delivery) signaled early, deepens via ritual surge forcing gasp-agency; cost unmistakable in "drowning...raw and agonizing miracle" reweighting options under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Imperfect miracles emerge implicitly from deluge to "simple, profound acceptance," reweighting premise without moral; final lighter chest offers non-literal resonance on grief's phantom limb.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias (Elara's notes "crawl"); Vex/Julian dialogue subtextual and idiomatic ("gravel wrapped in silk" vs. flimsy whispers). Rhythm modulates to peak compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels (notes "shimmer...lift like dying embers"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (bell in vacuum) without muddling climax hum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms exorcism via copper-wire ritual on sheet music/perfume synthesis; fresh "static cling between worlds" angle risks tech-ethereal grit, inevitable in hindsight closure.</comment>
