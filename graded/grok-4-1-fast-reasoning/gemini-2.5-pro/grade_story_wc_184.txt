<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's warmly methodical trait drives all key choices, from retrievals to weaving, with interiority concrete in cross-referencing the seal; competence balanced by the "utterly mad" task reveals subtle struggle. Final integration earns a meaningful reconfiguration with archival cost legible. No deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but micro-choices under anomaly pressure satisfy 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: door discovery → seal retrieval → rope reconfiguration → stable integration as DC with "reminding the universe" cost in final weave. One tightening at weaving narrows anomaly options; orientation anchors by para 2. Structure fits two shards with seamless transitions; closure cost undeniable in door's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clock tower's gears and hum constrain weaving choice, charging final image where door gains handle; sensory details (scent of paper, rope's shimmer) filter through archivist POV. Micro-setting of escapement wheel and governor integrates action. Environment evolves causally to mirror integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrate anomaly) signals early, tightens via weaving agency that forecloses banishment path with procedural cost; pressure coheres causally to Charged Poise in reading room reveal. One reversal at rope integration tests commitment. Entry to 8.8+ via legible price, but no moral calculus sharpens peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of integrating absence emerges organically from fables → relics → weave, with final card-writing as resonant non-literal answer reweighting "conquered the impossible" premise. Rope's "what-ifs" motif shifts to ordered clarity without moralizing. 9+ test met: ending reconfigures priors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with archivist perceptual signature (mind as "library," pattern cross-references); voice modulates precisely from curiosity to satisfaction. Rhythmic control heightens weave tension; no elision or head-hopping. 9+ test: distinct signature under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "braid of what-ifs" advances plot/atmosphere/theme); varied rhythm propels from hum to chime without loops or scaffolds. Metaphors purposeful and consistent, no overwriting in climax weave. 9+ test: zero artifacts, propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival lore and temporal seam transforms portal trope via relic-weaving; risk in "mad" integration heightens stakes organically. Final reading room feels inevitable from fables buildup; no derivative echoes. 9+ test: non-obvious inevitability with risk (+0.3).</comment>
