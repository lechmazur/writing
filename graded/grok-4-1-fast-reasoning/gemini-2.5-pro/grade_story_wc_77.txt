<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the mirror confrontation, where fear of the void battles its use as bait, earning the final choice to wield brokenness as weapon with clear cost to self-conception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through note-driven navigation to clasp grasp and void revelation as Decisive Change; cost legible in "light arced to the mirrors... faces dissolved," reconfiguring Fear's defeat from prior setups without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Funhouse micro-setting constrains via "warped slide" descent and "forest of sagging pendulums," charging final clasp image; luminance glow filters POV bias, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to trick Fear escalates via agency in following notes to confession—"You’re right... void in me"—narrowing options under causal lens, with cost in mirrors' "reaching out... permanence" forcing trade-off crystallized at clasp eruption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of brokenness defeating wholeness emerges organically from void confession reweighting Fear's hunger; final "curse... like a weapon" offers resonant non-literal answer, charging prior luminance motif without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature—"afterimages, in echoes"—biases noticing toward luminance and mirrors; voice modulates rhythmically under stress, stable POV with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax in peak ("light arced... dissolved"); minor figurative density in opening ("sugar and rust") purposeful without muddle, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of curse-as-anchor voids Fear's logic, transforming funhouse tropes through lived paradox; "void... gateway it could not comprehend" feels inevitable, bold risk heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
