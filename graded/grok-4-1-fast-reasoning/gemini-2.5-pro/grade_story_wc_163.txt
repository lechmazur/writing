<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation rooted in feather and belonging rhythm drives micro-choices like dimming lights; Elara's skepticism yields to awe in "her hard features softened," earning relational shift. Minor epiphany phrasing edges toward abstraction but ties to embodied feather touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: energy patterns build density to light-jellies arrival as cadence shift; CR closure lands on-page with "sharp edges of grief had been smoothed" as felt cost, reweighting belonging premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome and abyssal black constrain observation choice, charging final violet sunrise image; sensory groans, pressure, bioluminescence selective and POV-biased toward wonder. Micro-setting (dome lights dimmed) mirrors internal rhythm discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove theory/find belonging before sunrise) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via Elara doubt to shared wonder tightening; cost legible in time pressure and smoothed grief, foreclosing isolation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges organically from feather reprise and light-sync image, reweighting loss via shared exhale; final "He was home" offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias toward "shadowseam wonder"; dialogue distinct—Elara curt, Kaelen calm—and goal-driven, advancing persuasion. Rhythmic prose modulates from tension to awe without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in light arrival build propulsion); high density integrates setting/action, minor overwriting in "luminous respite" cluster but no loops or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Landscape astrologer syncing geothermal with jellies transforms deep-sea tropes via specific pattern discovery; fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, risking poetic tone without obscuring pressure.</comment>
