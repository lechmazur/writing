<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular in "wistful ache" and motivation as "translator between generations"; final seashell placement earns stasis via prior sound-gathering choices with isolation cost legible. Contradictory impulses in revering silence yet composing symphony act simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound density builds to Charged Poise closure in "new kind of silence, one that felt full," reconfiguring box with conceptual cost of "small, daily sin" paid via attention; orientation anchored early, one tightening via box discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dunes loft and shore constrain gathering (net bag clinks) and charge final image (sun rays, jars semi-circle); sensory hierarchy (whistle, heartbeat) reflects poet's priorities, mirroring internal states without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sweeten silence) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via gathered sounds narrowing to harmony; agency in uncorking forces trade-off, cost in "patient, endless wandering" legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of lost voices translated emerges organically from jars/box; final image ("translated its ghost into the language of the now") reweights premise without moral, ambiguity in lonesome justification lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV stable third-limited with poetic perceptual signature ("grey silk of morning sea"); rhythmic control modulates from dawn hush to symphony swell, diction biased toward sonic textures.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image ("dusty fingers of gold"); figurative pattern (sea/sigh motifs) taught early without muddle, minor density slip in descriptive runs but propulsion clear at uncorking climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sound-jars premise fresh synthesis transforms trope of beach scavenger; risk in lyric accumulation inevitable to transfigured box, no derivative echoes.</comment>
