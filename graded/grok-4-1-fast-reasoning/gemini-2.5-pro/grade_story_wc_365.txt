<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in sensory obsession drives all choices to climax; embodied realization—"The truth landed with its full, crushing weight"—earns final redirection over futile rescue, with felt parental protection cost. Minor lack of shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: sensory mapping → truth discovery → redirection DC with conceptual cost (existence's instability). Closure reconfigures accident premise on-page—"visions collapsed, leaving only the quiet, dusty dark"—with undeniable price in final datalog entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy (ozone, chai tea, wind frequency) filters through Kael's map-maker bias, constraining climax via bay's nexus physics; shard as micro-setting charges final image—"lowered the green glass, its purpose fulfilled." 9+ gate met.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth, avert cascade) signaled early, tightens via Elara sighting to agency-driven redirection; cost legible in foreclosed rescue path, but single turn without micro-reversal slightly limits escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of withheld truths emerges from bleed-through particulars, reweighted by CR—"a debt paid to a ghost who was never there"—without moralizing; resonant final image answers instability premise obliquely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with sensory-biased perceptual signature; rhythmic texture modulates from descriptive build to clipped climax—"hum screamed, then snapped"—under stress. No dialogue, no issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion without loops; minor overwriting in opening metaphors ("cavernous hall of rust and silence") risks slight drag, but closure image crisp and artifact-free.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory cartography and parallel resonance cascade transforms multiverse trope; risk-taking in "soul realignment" physics inevitable in hindsight, heightening closure ingenuity.</comment>
