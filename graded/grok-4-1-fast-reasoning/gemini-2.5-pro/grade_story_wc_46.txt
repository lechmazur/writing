<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and embodied motivation rooted in grandmother's words and village fire memory compel the polishing choices; micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values with isolation as felt cost. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene prevents 9+; resolute endurance earns stasis without deeper ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: polishing density builds to pattern break (glow emanates), landing Charged Poise closure as glass pulses with self-sustaining light, reweighting her untethered state with conceptual cost of past fire in final image. Orientation anchored early (grotto, mist); single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (salt air, damp stones, warming shard) selectively mirror internal reclamation; grotto curves protectively in final glow, charging closure image as recurring object (glass) constrains polishing choice. Micro-setting (body/hands, glass) enables tactile transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (glow without fire) signaled early, tightens via polishing deepening (opaque to vibrant) under Accumulative lens, narrowing to successful emission with effort cost legible in "hours bled into a single, focused moment." Agency in repetitive motions forces trade-off; no major slips touch peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patient light vs. fleeting fire emerges organically from polishing arc and fire memory, resonating in final image of "quiet light for a world... too loud and too bright with the wrong kind of fire" as non-literal CR reweighting premise. No moralizing; ambiguity in shareability lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with star/sea perceptual signature stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation (meditative friction to serene pulse) heightens pressure without elision or head-hopping. Prose texture as character: syntax reflects patient mind under isolation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("rhythmic friction was a meditation"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Minor figurative density ("zephyr bloom promising a soft unfolding") risks overwrite but stays voice-consistent without harming glow peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh magical realism in sea glass-to-star synthesis transforms trash reclamation trope; risk-taking lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes via subtle luminescence without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
