<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied guilt as "low-frequency hum," driving micro-choices like etching the server; contradictory work-to-silence ritual yields earned peace at "hum inside him ceased," with visible memorial cost. Backstory letters anchor present without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density to Resonant Reconfiguration closure: screen's "Papa." reconfigures cry to rest, cost in amber tombstone legible on final lab image; shards transition legibly under tattooist-star-map pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber gnat recurs as micro-setting constraining etch choice and charging final "golden tombstone"; lab "concrete monolith where time folds" mirrors internal hush, sensory selective via tattooist lens (needle whisper, cold sterile air).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to hush cry/dissonance tightens via agency in etching Lyra constellation, reweighting text from "Cold. Scared." to "Papa."; cost unmistakable in silenced hum and leather memorial foreclosing guilt loop.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mapping loss to rest emerges via constellation/amber particulars, final leather tattoo non-literally answering guilt's hum with peaceful connection; no moralizing, resonance from shifted screen words reweighting motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with tattooist perceptual signature (circuits as "pathways, like the star-charts"); lyrical rhythm modulates from "meteor hush" to lab stillness, purposeful compression taught early pays at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, no loops; metaphors cohere (city "nebula," amber "tombstone") without muddle, peaking cleanly at "hum inside him ceased" for propulsion under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of tattooist charting ghost cry via amber-etched server transforms tropes; risk in firmware-baby cries/haunted tech feels inevitable, heightening stakes to hush without gimmick.</comment>
