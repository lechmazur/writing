<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear and embodied via thread focus and lifelong cartography; interiority concrete in "phantom ache in her shoulders." No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase in projection; CR closure via realization of healing's geography, cost legible in "chill...sharper now, the silence deeper." Orientation anchored early by garden, ship, thread.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden's chill and thread constrain projection choice and charge final image as "key, a biography in miniature." Sensory details selective via POV, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping healing signaled early, escalates accumulatively via intimate projection deepening knowledge of Elara's grief. Cost felt in sharper chill post-vision, foreclosing prior ignorance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of healing as containment emerges organically from carpet map and final writing; resonant CR reweights absence as "triumphant journey" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent third-limited POV with poetic perceptual signature in "crimson haze, the scent of pears replaced"; rhythm modulates from calm garden to intimate vision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering like "perfume of rust-colored chrysanthemums"; varied rhythm propels to closure, no loops or scaffolds dulling final journal image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh translocation method via thread transforms eulogy trope into geographic mapping; risk of intimate projection pays off in hindsight inevitability at writing beat.</comment>
