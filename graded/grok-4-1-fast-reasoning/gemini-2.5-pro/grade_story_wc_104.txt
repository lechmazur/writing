<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's patiently strategic mind and chained endurance compel the decoding choice with embodied calm ("profound stillness"), earning her stasis as purpose frees despite bodily cost; contradictory impulses subtly act in non-violent grace under tremor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: arrow fletching → key reordering → panel activation → defenses rise with cost (her immobility); Charged Poise closure crystallizes victory image ("beautiful noise of her victory") with undeniable chain-price legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Carnival decay (chain "ligament," "dusty, grinning bears") constrains choices (bench access despite tether) and charges final ray-lit face; sensory hierarchy sharpens via strategic POV amid chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vault/seeds) tightens via arrow-deciphered agency narrowing to automated delay; cost unmistakable in enforcers' hindered shouts and her binding endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Resilience theme emerges organically from chained acts planting future ("sown the future from a cage"); final image non-literally answers liberation paradox without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (strategic stillness filters chaos); rhythmic control heightens pressure ("cacophonous, automated defense system") without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via vivid propulsion ("spasmed to life, dropping tangled mountains"); no loops, varied rhythm sustains ear-test through climax activation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of carnival traps via key-cipher transforms tropes; petal-arrow and prize-defense premise feels inevitable and riskily theatrical, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
