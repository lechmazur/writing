<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to decode leaves roots consistently in his precise sorting and monument-building, culminating in the earned prod that transforms him with embodied cost felt in his shimmering hands. Interiority shines in concrete details like breath catching at the speck, avoiding stock phrases. Final change forecloses his prior quiet existence, satisfying 9+ test via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: leaf patterns accumulate to anomaly, monument deepens density, prod delivers on-page Decisive Change with arbor's tremor as legible cost soaking into floor and bones. Orientation anchors Elian/Great Root early. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt; closure reconfigures premise with undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ashen skyborne arbor constrains via falling leaves dictating sorting/monuments; mica spire and root hairs as micro-setting charge prod moment. Sensory details (brittle sugar leaf, pearlescent pulse) filter through Elian's tender priorities, evolving to jade leaves. Satisfies 9+ test: recurring arbor bark flakes to reveal green, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode leaves) signaled early tightens accumulatively via speck anomaly, forcing monument/prod with deepening pressure; cost unmistakable in arbor's shiver awakening Elian. Protagonist agency drives escalation under lens. Single intensification suffices, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of small catalyzing vast emerges organically from sorting to prod, reweighting prophecy in jade leaves without moralizing. Final image (shimmering hands, inhalation of life) offers non-literal resonant answer to "tender of small things," satisfying 9+ test. Counter-reading lingers in prophecy's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (mossy delight in precision) stable in single POV, modulating rhythm to hush's deepening. Diction like "brittle as spun sugar" purposeful, no head-hopping. Satisfies 9+ test: rhythmic control heightens prod's chime.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via layered images (ashen veins pulsing); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure. Minor figurative density purposeful in accumulative pattern, not overwriting. Satisfies 9+ test: zero artifacts in peak prod beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore/prophecy via leaf monuments and speck prod feels inevitable; transforms tropes through skyborne arbor's sigh-to-breath. Risky lyric accumulation heightens small-to-monumental stakes without gimmickry, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
