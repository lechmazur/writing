<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solid motivation rooted in traits drives micro-choices like channel carving and coin placement; interiority concrete via loom metaphor. Minor slip: no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, limiting 9+ test, though final retrieval earns quiet endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly through because/therefore chain (channel nudges water to machine, coin triggers cascade to light via bishop); closure as Charged Poise in mural illumination and Kael's internal smile lands on-page with ephemeral cost felt in "light died as quickly as it had been born." Orientation anchored early; no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting integrates purposefully: tidal pools under Lyra constrain bishop placement and water path, charging final beam reflection; sensory hierarchy (hiss of tide, metallic sigh) mirrors Kael's priorities. Recurring arcade machines evolve causally, mirroring internal creativity without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchestrating beauty from mundane) signaled early, tightens causally via setups culminating in cascade reversal; agency in precise nudges forecloses failure path with cost in solitary "internal smile" as only applause. Pressure coheres under causal lens to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of creativity defying monotony emerges organically from chain to mural shine, reweighting premise in final image of "painted eyes... shine with captured starlight" without moralizing; subtext in couple's wonder contrasts Kael's isolation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in poetic biases ("loom weaving threads," "solved equation"); rhythmic texture modulates elegantly from observation to climax without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances chain or atmosphere, e.g., "silver tongue licking" varies rhythm naturally; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors despite density—coherent and ear-pleasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Rube Goldberg physics with poetic art transforms arcade tropes; risk in hyper-detailed causality (coin to bishop to mural) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via "orchestrated serendipity."</comment>
