<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's dreamless state and embodied "phantom limb aching" drive the micro-choice to embrace over erase, earning the final dream-stirring reconfiguration with visible cost in receding awareness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build to Charged Poise closure; pine memory intrusion tightens to resonant crystalline synthesis, cost legible in "the feeling of being everywhere receding back into the solid, singular form."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glowing dune and shivering pale blooms constrain the charm and charge the final crystalline pine image, with sensory hierarchy narrowing to pine scent under crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of archive stability escalates accumulatively via tremor to wave overlap, agency in synthesis foreclosing erasure/shatter paths with receding singularity as on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of past-present synthesis emerges implicitly via pine-sand overlap, final crystalline structure resonantly reweighting dreamless endurance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with flickering "occasionally everywhere" perceptual signature; rhythmic lyricism modulates seamlessly under pressure, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density propels via varied syntax, coherent metaphors like "net cast across the glowing sand" heighten peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quantum archive and wave-function charm synthesize post-apocalypse into fresh, inevitable conceptual repricing; risk-taking in lyric sci-fi elevates stakes organically.</comment>
