<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's expectantly resigned sigh embodies internal conflict, driving the pivot from addition to subtraction with micro-choices like holding the rosette. Contradictory impulses—resignation versus persistence—act simultaneously in the failed rehearsal cue. Final endurance in guiding silence earns the unified hum, foreclosing forced blending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: library reflection accumulates prior failure to crystallize subtraction method, tightening to Charged Poise closure in the hum's resonance. Orientation anchored in opening paragraph. Cost legible in "two years" friction yielding to fragile whole.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rosette as micro-setting constrains realization and choir instruction, charging final hands-denoting image. Autumn decay mirrors vanishing arts without cliché overload. Sensory details (old paper, rust) filter through Elias's priorities, evolving to hushed room's tactile calm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—braiding rivals—tightens accumulatively from failed hymn to breathing/hum via agency in noise subtraction. One deepening forecloses addition path with felt cost of prior dissonance. Final yielding reconfigures pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of harmony via subtraction emerges from rosette carving to resentment release, culminating in non-literal resonant hum without moralizing. Final image reweights premise: "no longer resigned, but purely expectant." Complexity lingers in imperfect whole.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elias-specific perceptual bias (rosette as life microcosm). Prose rhythm modulates from reflective cadence to urgent silence-guiding. Brief dialogue natural, subtext-laden: "carved away the unnecessary parts."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; opening anchors stakes imagistically. Minor figurative density ("painting the world in gold and rust") in reflection but weaves without muddle. No loops; closure image crisp: "a resonance in a quiet room."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rosette-zither as fresh lens on choir rivalry transforms vanishing arts trope. Subtraction method risks bold pivot, heightening stakes organically. Inevitable synthesis: relic's negative space births harmony from hatred's ashes.</comment>
