<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to thresh meaning drives consistent micro-choices, like following trails and offering the exchange, culminating in an earned shift to sketching the woman's face. Interiority feels concrete and painterly, with embodied insomnia as "predator" to "companion." Woman's brief presence applies relational pressure without stock dilution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details layer from insomnia to unearthed find to exchange, tightening to CR closure where sketching the face reconfigures his artistic pursuit with felt cost ("ache of a soul stretched"). Orientation anchors immediately in tidal island post-wars. One seamless transition back home maintains drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting specifics like rain trails, causeway mud, and bluffs' exposed roots+drone constrain the journey and charge the convergence image. Sensory selection (slick mud, warm amber) reflects painterly urgency. Tide's return forces closure on dry land, mirroring internal reweighting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (threshing meaning) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via discovery's awe to exchange's human cost, narrowing to new painting stance. Agency in "An exchange, then" forecloses object-possession for narrative gain. Cost legible in reframed insomnia.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of meaning-from-chaos emerges via particulars: fossilized fly, tangled roots+drone, brooch story, resolving in final sketch as "holding the grain." Resonant CR reweights without moralizing; ambiguity in "haggard awe" lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with painterly perceptual signature ("chaotic calligraphy," "trapped sunlight"). Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven in exchange ("Just the story"), distinguishing voices. Rhythmic modulation under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("thresh meaning like... grain from chaff") integrated into action; rhythm varies without loops. Minor simile density in opening but propels accumulative texture. Closure image crisp: "sketch a woman's face, her eyes reflecting... amber brooch."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-wars tidal world, painterly quest, and relic-exchange transforms tropes; unearthed "knot of petrified... drone" feels inevitable. Risk in quiet CR closure heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
