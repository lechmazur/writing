<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority rooted in embodied sorrow ("aches with a peculiar, inherited sorrow") and contradictory impulses (renewal as erasure); final renunciation of calculation earned by prior pings, with sentimental flaw charging the broadcast choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via pings to gear discovery, culminating in on-page CR where pings shift to emission, reweighting pattern with conceptual cost of forsaking ancestral math ("releasing the gear... a relic"). Orientation anchored early; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nebula garden and gear constrain navigation/handling and charge final image (dusting form, tumbling gear); selective sensory hierarchy (empathy echoes over visuals) mirrors internal wound, evolving to bloom without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break consumption cycle) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via gear deepening knowledge of failure, forcing emission stance; cost legible in foreclosed calculation path, though minor abstractness slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of emission over consumption emerges organically from gear contrast and ping shift; final broadcast image offers non-literal resonant answer ("turning the... silence into a garden... beginning to bloom"), reweighting renewal without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (empathy-sonar mapping sorrow); rhythmic prose modulates from ache to bloom ("slow transit... quiet sigh"), voice apt for cosmic lyricism without elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm (short ping bursts amid flowing descriptions); no loops or artifacts, though minor light-fire recurrence borders redundancy but serves motif without dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic husbandry, empathy sonar, and relic gear transforms renewal trope; risk-taking in lyric CR (search=light) feels inevitable, heightening stakes through irreplaceable particulars.</comment>
