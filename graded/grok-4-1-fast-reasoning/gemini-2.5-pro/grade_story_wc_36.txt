<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied ("shard of ice in his gut," "knuckles...white"), motivation drives micro-choices from arranging to tentative playing, earning change via past blind spot; minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously slightly tempers from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual builds density to shimmer and CR insight ("treated the flute like a hammer when it was meant to be a needle and thread"), with legible emotional cost ("clean, sharp pain") on page; orientation anchored early in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via "unseen currents" dictating driftwood alignment and charges closure ("canyon held his grief...and...understanding"); sensory hierarchy (hush, ozone, shimmer) reflects POV urgency, vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest insight) signaled early, deepens via flute-playing reversal (force to question), reweighting under Accumulative lens with agency in micro-turn ("first note...tentative"); cost felt in lancing pain, but internal focus slightly mutes external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of harmony vs. barrier emerges organically from ritual to insight, resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing; final image ("flute resting...canyon held") non-literal answer to failure's question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("sorrowful curiosity," biased noticing of currents); rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate to immersive ("note hung...sank"), distinct texture under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, propulsion in syntax variety (short notes amid lush); no loops/artifacts, inventive diction ("avalanchingly quiet") coherent; minor overwriting in metaphors ("cathedral of silent...stone") doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic/flute as "needle and thread" transforms guardianship trope; risk in lyric ritual pays off at insight, organic to voice/setting without derivative echoes.</comment>
