<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via shaking hands at flames and artist's eye sparking at frost; contradictory fear/need impulses act in retracing beats; final kiln-lighting earned by adaptive micro-choices with visible cost of confronting fire trauma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost discovery tightens density linking ledger glyphs to canyon patterns, yielding CR closure in kiln-firing with undeniable conceptual cost of reweighting fire from destroyer to creator; orientation anchored early in canyon post-fire.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Canyon micro-setting (shaded sentinel rock, river reeds, frost on cobalt shard) constrains decoding choices and charges final etched glass image; sensory selection (ghost-heat, piercing cold) purposeful via POV artist's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose amid trauma) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via frost-pattern deepening that narrows fear to actionable path; retracing agency forecloses avoidance with on-page cost in cave realization and kiln return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fire/ice duality emerges organically from particulars (fused shards to frost cipher to encoded glass); final image non-literally answers survival-through-patterns without moralizing, reweighting silence as conversation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in geometric frost recognition; lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from quiet observation to resonant charge at "sealed it between two panes," controlled under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts; rhythm varies (short dawn-rising sentences to flowing etching close); propulsion peaks in "held it against the frost patterns," no overwriting in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frost-as-map cipher transforming artist-trauma trope; ledger-to-glass encoding inevitable from canyon particulars; lyrical risk heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
