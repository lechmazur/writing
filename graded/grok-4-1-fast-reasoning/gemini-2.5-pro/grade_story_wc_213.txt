<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation to "favor listening over noise" roots consistently in credibly curious trait and discovery of bell rope, compelling higher-stakes override at "He gripped the cool, fibrous length"; internal consistency without contradiction elevates to near-exceptional, though lacks overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via preparations (console repair, signal tracking) leading to zero-hour diversion; Decisive Change lands on-page in breaker throw and rope pull parting clouds, with legible conceptual cost in foreclosed siren protocol reconfiguring safety.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Windblown sanctuary and resonant stone constrain climax choices (rope access, power diversion), charging final image of parting clouds; sensory hush-to-hum evolution mirrors internal shift purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hearing sky's voice vs. siren noise signaled early, tightens causally through countdown narrowing options to override; agency in final pull/throw forecloses protocol path with felt institutional cost, though no secondary loss shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of listening over noise emerges organically from signal patterns, rope tuning, and hush-to-hum reconfiguration, with final image non-literally answering via parted clouds; resonant without moralizing or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward harmonic whispers amid chaos; rhythmic prose modulates from hush to resonant peak without filter excess or drift, prose as character in "solstice hush" texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with zero loops or scaffolds propels via varied rhythm in countdown ("Twenty. He inputted..."); no figurative muddle, precise verbs like "thrummed" heighten closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm siren as noise-drowner tuned via forgotten rope transforms sci-fi trope into resonant listening premise; risk in zero-hour subversion feels inevitable from early patterns.</comment>
