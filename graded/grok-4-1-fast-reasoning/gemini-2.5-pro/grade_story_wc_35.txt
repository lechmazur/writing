<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to "sandpaper rough memories" drives consistent traits and higher-stakes choices like tasting the fossil and subsuming motes; interiority embodied in "sharp, specific agony" and contradictory grief intake. Final change earned via prior causality with scouring cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "emotionally contagious touch" slightly abstracts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: puddle patterns accumulate to fossil taste-map, discovery, subsumption tightening density to RR closure. Orientation anchored early in courtyard/fortress. Cost legible in "agony that scoured him clean, sandpapering his own heart"; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Desert fortress post-rain vividly selective ("wet stone and bruised creosote," "dunes weeping"); coral pavilion constrains entry/digging and charges dissolution image. Sensory hierarchy via chef's palate/touch biases; evolves causally with storm-scoured basin. Mirrors internal remorse without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (process/smooth memories) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via taste-map to pavilion density forcing subsumption agency; forecloses prior endurance with "pulverize his bones" pressure into scouring cost. One decisive deepening reweights options legibly on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of ending stored remorse emerges organically via fossil legion-taste, motes blizzard to acceptance note; final hand-on-arm reconfigures contagion without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like "impossibly, terrifyingly smooth" heart, inviting ambiguity on peace's price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in taste/sediment noticing; voice texture poetic-rhythmic ("shovel scraping rock," "blizzard of grief"). Warlord dialogue sparse/natural, subtext-laden; no head-hopping, elision taught via ritual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short peak-stress sentences in subsumption); metaphors consistent (sandpaper motif) without muddle. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors doesn't touch closure; no loops/artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-tasting chef decoding puddle/fossil to impossible coral-ice remorse vault; transforms desert tropes via brine-scent, motes. Bold risk in surreal pavilion dissolution heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight sans gimmick.</comment>
