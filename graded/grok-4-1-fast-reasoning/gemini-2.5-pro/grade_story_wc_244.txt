<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to cure loneliness roots in consistent traits like quiet desperation and reciprocity, intensifying to his nudge among arrivals; interiority concrete via moon rock handling and jocular cheer to pigeons. Contradictory impulses act in scene (watching hesitantly then intervening). Final endurance earned by prior causality, but minor telling in reflective blocks slightly dilutes embodiment under peak arrival hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rumor ellipsis builds density to arrivals, tightening at Silas's intervention creates Charged Poise reconfiguration. Closure CR lands on-page with conceptual cost in "still lonely, but... not alone," reweighting isolation premise via final image. Orientation anchored early in station details; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy-dripped clock and rusting platform constrain gathering and mirror malaise-to-connection shift, charging final image under clock. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (pigeons, moss thud); details evolve causally from shadows to fire barrel. Environment guides choice in side-door circle and shared task.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cure loneliness via catalysis) signaled early, escalates accumulatively from rumor seeding to hesitation-deepening at arrivals, narrowing to nudge agency. Cost legible in foreclosed isolation path and "still lonely" endurance. Pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocity-as-cure emerges organically from rumor chain to shared fire/tasks, final image offering non-literal resonance via "winding a community back to life." Subtext in unshown moon rock reweights journey over object. Complexity lingers in ongoing loneliness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in selectively biased details (moon rock as loneliness key); voice modulates rhythm from echoing cheer to tentative melody. Sparse dialogue natural, goal-driven ("fix a clock"), subtext-laden. No head-hopping; diction reflects isolated logistician.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job via integrated image/action (e.g., "ivy dripped over the rusting clock face"). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative language purposeful, not overwrought in peak (arrivals beat). Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: moon rock rumor catalyzes community in apathetic world, transforming tropes via logistician ingenuity. Risk in rumor ellipsis pays off at polite anarchy closure; non-obvious reciprocity extension to fellowship feels inevitable.</comment>
