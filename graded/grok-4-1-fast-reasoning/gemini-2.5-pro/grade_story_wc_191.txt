<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in historical knowledge compels precise micro-choices like sonic humming and chisel work, earning closure without epiphany; embodied urgency in "time bled away" reveals character under pressure. No strong contradictory impulses shown in scene, but competence balanced by prior failures' graveyard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: peeling layers build density to prime layer map, culminating in CR closure ("THRONE FILLED") with time cost legible as "sky...violet; dawn...breath away." Orientation anchored early; one tightening via revelations narrows to ruby insertion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard's metallophytes and monolith constrain choices (sonic access, peeling site) and charge final image ("crystalline trees flared...staircase"); sensory ozone/blooming filters through lore-keeper bias, evolving causally with energy flow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fill throne by dawn) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via failure murals tightening to map/indentation; agency in precise peeling forces trade-off, cost felt in chronometer pulse and staked life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory over rule emerges from murals' ambitions-to-failures and heartstone reveal, reweighting premise in final notification/realization without statement; resonant CR in dissolving staircase answers "not a body...its heart."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (codex-guided noticing); rhythmic prose modulates ("chime resonated...pulsed with crimson glow") under pressure, distinct sci-fi texture without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("light-curtain flickered, hesitated, and then parted"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts in peak peeling/climax; purposeful figures like "rivers of light" enhance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms throne trope via data-palimpsest failures and heartstone signal; fresh synthesis of sonic chisel/peeling to CR feels inevitable, risking quiet non-ascension closure that heightens ingenuity.</comment>
