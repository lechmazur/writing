<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in translator instincts and personal coral memory compels sharing the symbols; interiority concrete via "lotus-hearted ache." General's flicker earned by revelation mirroring his heart. Minor lack: no simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal translation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: symbol discovery builds density to Charged Poise closure in General's "stony expression flickered" and throat swallow, with emotional cost legible. Single scene, orientation anchored early in clinic/atrium. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist and twilight charge final image of "something had imperceptibly cleared," contrasting internal resolution; generator hiss and sterile air filter through Elias's priorities. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under quiet tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (personal mediation) tightens via translation deepening shared fears, narrowing to vulnerability trade-off; agency in Elias's choice to reveal "afraid of the thunder." Cost unmistakable in General's unguarded moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of shared anxieties emerges via symbols' lexicon, reweighting conflict in final hand-on-head without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer: pain identical across lines, charged by mist-clearing image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (unknotting patterns); dialogue subtextual—"She is dreaming of home"—advances stakes. Rhythmic control modulates from hushed to resonant close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; purposeful metaphors like "twilight bled into a deep violet" integrate without muddle. Minor overwriting in opening descriptors, but no loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: child's cast as cipher for peace transforms mediation trope. Coral fragment and symbols offer non-obvious angle on anxiety bridge.</comment>
