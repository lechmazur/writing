<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation intensifies credibly from levee duty to obsession, culminating in precisely humane ledger correction earned by photo trail; embodied emotions in mud-sucking boots and tidal-wave realization. Minor flaw: archive evenings summarized without micro-choices, but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: photo discoveries densify pattern, culminating in CR closure via ledger strike-through and appended evidence, with conceptual cost of challenging legend legible in "precisely humane" act and community murmurs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reservoir bed and exposed tavern constrain discoveries, charging final corkboard image; "mirrored hush" motif evolves from valley silence to filled understanding, with sensory mud and glint anchoring POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. legend) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via attic photo reversal changing knowledge/options; cost legible in foreclosed coward narrative and humane correction trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stories-into-meaning emerges organically via photo trail and ledger act, resonant non-literal answer in community hall image reweighting grandfather's "fiction" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (ghosts, skeletal grins); rhythmic diction modulates from resonant wire to steady voice, no head-hopping despite time shards.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, vivid rhythm in "sick man's gums" to final murmurs; minor paraphrase loop in "quiet obsession" beats (−0.4), but closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of resurfacing town and humane record-fixing transforms ghost-story trope; risk in quiet, non-violent closure heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
