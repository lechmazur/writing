<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's reflective nature and motivation to illuminate the mundane drive concrete micro-choices like stone-skipping, earning the renunciation with embodied peace; internal conflict between static creation and flow acts via patterned observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from mist's tension to pond ripples' CR, reweighting atrium's meaning with transience cost; orientation anchors immediately, single-shard motion to charged poise closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pond's dark mirror and brackish earth constrain revelation choice; atrium facets charge final rainbow image, with sensory selection (mist texture, gull flight) mirroring internal shift purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reading the shift escalates accumulatively via ripples' interference, narrowing to renunciation agency; cost of life's work's undermining legible in refusal to save.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ripple patterns and final rainbow reconfigure static value to flow without moralizing, emerging organically from glazier's arc; resonance lingers in transience's conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with geometric perceptual signature (light-bending, patterns) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates tension to peace, diction controlled and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and image-charged sentences; no loops or artifacts, rhythm peaks at "silent, shimmering explosion" without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ripple interference as glazier divination synthesizes trade and philosophy freshly; risk in quiet CR heightens inevitability without gimmickry.</comment>
