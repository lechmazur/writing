<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in "joyful sorrow" embodied through fluid signs turning desperate at climax; Lyra's urges compel higher-stakes micro-choices like targeting the nexus, earning final endurance with heart-cost. Minor abstraction in Lyra's silken whispers doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pylon mapping to nexus climax with on-page Resonant Reconfiguration as hum lifts oppressive silence, cost legible in "sorrow of their loss"; single continuous scene oriented early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Environment constrains via "divining rod" camera guiding to oblivion depths, charging final image of silvered water now singing; selective sensory hierarchy (cool leather, brittle iron) mirrors Elian's priorities without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to disrupt via mapping tightens texturally to aggressive nexus silence, agency in "hands flew... demanding," cost unmistakable in bone-hum melody replacing weight; one decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of voicing forgotten emerges organically through particulars like rotted initials; final image reconfigures silence-as-void to unending song, resonant non-literal answer with lingering joyful sorrow ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward silence textures ("texture and depth"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in climax "ballet," lyric compression taught early and legible at charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion varying rhythm (short desperate clauses at "hands flew"); no loops/artifacts, purposeful lyric metaphors like "rippling sheet of silver" cohere without muddle in peak nexus beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera-as-void-diviner and silence-sign-symphony transforms tropes inevitably; risk in surreal disruption hums with emotional specificity, no hedging, charges closure uniquely.</comment>
