<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in "quiet ache" intensifies to compel precise, high-risk choices; interiority concrete and particular via embodied details like dust as "second skin of grit and compromise." Final endurance of duty fulfilled earns closure with felt cost in relief. Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously keeps it from perfect 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: mapping gaps → countdown → uncork → transfer → bluebird confirmation as DC with legible risk cost in "predatory hum" returning. Single scene, orientation anchored early ("disputed territory," postbox, arcade). Closure reconfigures options—promise healed—via on-page data stream.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dust, "fading bruise" clouds, cobalt flicker constrain timing and charge final image; sensory hierarchy narrows to hums and cold air under drone pressure. Micro-setting (rusted postbox port) guides hidden action. Twilight arcade mirrors internal hush-to-weight shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (smuggle consciousness undetected) signaled early, tightens causally via countdown to 30-second window narrowing options. Agency in linking absences forecloses detection path with visible cost (spent bottle, returning drones). Escalation driven by protagonist tactics under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of healing promises via absences emerges organically through data transfer as CR, reweighting premise in "build it, one absence at a time." Final image offers resonant answer without moralizing. Particulars like bluebird and light bottle layer emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (e.g., "thread a needle through its seams"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in countdown. No head-hopping or withholding; diction biased to Elias's solemn view. Elevated but consistent voice fits rebellious sacrament tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "air went thin and cold" advances action/atmosphere); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Rhythm varies for propulsion, peaking in uncork-transfer beat. Minor fig density in opener contained, purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: consciousness smuggling via "thunderstorm in a bottle" and absence-linking transforms border trope organically. Method's ingenuity grows from particulars, risks bold sci-fi premise fully. Inevitable hindsight via causal buildup.</comment>
