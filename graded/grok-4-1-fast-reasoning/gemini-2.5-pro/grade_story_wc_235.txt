<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in embodied "feral nostalgia... physical hunger," driving micro-choices like pushing the scroll; flight trance earns reconfiguration to artistry, foreclosing resentment with "hand... steady" at closure, satisfying 9+ test without unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via reflective density on scroll, holds through pattern break (snap to trance), lands CR closure "points on a single... map" reweighting timeline premise with legible cost in quieted jealousy; orientation anchored by para 2, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cabin/scroll/porch micro-setting constrains trance from "this very porch" memory, charges final pull to scroll; selective sensory integration (charcoal crumble, pine rush) mirrors internal shift without catalog, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distill chaos vs. nostalgia) signaled para 1, escalates via density to trance tightening narrowing resentment options; agency in willed flight forecloses envy with "heart hammering" cost legible on return, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of warring selves as "single... map" emerges organically from flight image reweighting chaos premise, resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; prior particulars (boy, lover, grave) accrue to oblique cost of prior "obscene" hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature biases to dream architecture/timeline fractures; rhythmic modulation accelerates in "wind tore... wild symphony," stable distance under stress with no elision withholding, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm/openings, no loops/scaffold; minor figurative density ("updraft catch me... child's block") in peak flight risks overwrite but integrates without muddle or closure dulling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grave-vision chronicler soaring over timeline transforms trope via specific "chronologically confused" map realization; risk-taking in waking trance heightens stakes/coherence, inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
