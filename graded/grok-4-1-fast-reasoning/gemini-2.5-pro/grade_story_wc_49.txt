<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Whimsical tinkerer traits shine in "puzzled together like a broken gear train" and note adjustment revealing expertise under pressure; motivation intensifies to compel chant surge. Limited contradictory impulses during pivotal vine-touch—trembling yields smoothly to confidence without embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hum density builds to chant crescendo, vine visions pattern-break to Charged Poise RR at dawn's ray dissolving light. Closure cost legible in "the alignment had passed"; orientation anchored early in arbor/moon hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Verdant arbor lattice and central post constrain vine weaving, charging final "memories that now saturated the very wood and leaves." Sensory hush/chill selective to ritual urgency; tinkerer bias filters via "natural frequency."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore via ritual) signaled early, tightens via dissonance reversal narrowing to full chant agency; one decisive density intensification suffices. Cost felt in fleeting seam's precision during vine growth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of remembering as remedy emerges via golden tableaus shifting "not a potion, but a remembering"; final saturated hush reweights premise without moralizing. Particulars like vine lineage ground resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature in "tuning the world" and selective dissonance ear; rhythm modulates from hush to swell. No dialogue; compression purposeful for ritual flow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with chant propulsion; density high in light-spinning without loops. Minor figurative density ("golden stories," "luminous coin") in climax risks slight overwrite but integrates without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer-song tuning vine to spin stories transforms sacred ritual trope; "reset the most important clock" inevitable from prior particulars. Risky lyric closure heightens without gimmick.</comment>
