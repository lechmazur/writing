<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to integrate laughter drives pivotal micro-choices like urging the folk song memory, earning the spirit's reconfiguration with embodied calm amid the shriek. Contradictory impulses surface in the spirit's recoil versus emerging chime, resolved on-page. Single minor slip in spirit's swift pivot post-laughter doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sonic density escalates from shards to shriek, breaks via clear chime into balanced melody, landing RR closure as spirit dissolves into sunrise with felt cost of accepted silence. Orientation anchors immediately in precipice/gorge. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tooth as recurring micro-setting anchors Silas (cool to warm), constrains descent/temple press, and charges final image. Sensory hierarchy sonic-dominant reflects stakes; gorge acoustics warp/heal mirroring ache. Environment subtly guides pursuit through reverberations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heal via joy integration) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via chaotic intensification to memory-deepening reversal, narrowing grief options with on-page cost in untangling melody. Agency in Silas's unflinching urging forces crystallization. Cost legible in spirit's brighter luminescence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of balanced sorrow/joy emerges organically via harp's shift from distortion to complete melody, reweighting silence as breath. Final image of fading notes offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Particulars like pie-fall laughter avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with sonic-biased perceptual signature; voice texture modulates from "luminous ache" to quiet satisfaction. Rhythmic control heightens pressure in shriek beat. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual, advancing confession.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "shimmering form huddled beside... snapped strings" advances setting/action/emotion); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops/artifacts. Figurative language purposeful, no muddle in peak shriek. Closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic pursuit/healing laughter transforms ghost trope; tooth's primal anchor risks poetic ingenuity without gimmick. Premise implications followed fully to sun-dissolution. Hindsight inevitability in music's untangling.</comment>
