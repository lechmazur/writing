<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between empirical method and faith act vividly in the realization beat ("The patterns were nonsensical... utterly resistant to logic"), earning the final singing/planting choice with embodied cost (persistent doubt).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dream density builds to pattern break realization, culminating in RR closure via seed's thrum and memory reweaving, with legible conceptual cost in "doubt remained... part of the very memory" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sky-plume blossoms and pollen/rain tang constrain the planting choice and charge the final image ("blossoms seemed to lean in... deepening to an almost painful vibrancy"), filtered through Elara's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory protection) tightens via agency-driven layering of dreams, forcing faith-leap trade-off; cost felt in panic ("cold and sharp") and foreclosed logic path, charging planting under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of belief-as-reality emerges organically from dream harmonization to final smile ("doubt... the question that kept the story alive"), reweighting prior material with resonant ambiguity in rain renewal image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("luminous doubt... empirically whimsical") biases noticing (dream symbols as meteorological data); rhythmic control heightens realization without elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (e.g., short panicked sentences amid lyrical buildup); zero loops, purposeful figurative layering (fraying tapestry) integrates without muddle in peak planting beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empirical fantasy via dream-sequence instruction feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric realization (backward river to lullaby) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
