<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory dread and hope embodied concretely ("knot of dread" vs. "cautiously hopeful flicker"); final readiness earned via transmission choice with exhaustion cost, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds from signal logging to monitor flicker, delivering Charged Poise closure; "exhausted ache" makes cost legible on-page, passing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Station's salvaged waveform generator constrains interference tactic; "bakelite cool and solid" and final "small, lonely station" charge closure image, meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Textural escalation via virulent signal dread to transmission narrows options under lens; agency-driven payoff with "heart hammering" to "exhausted ache" cost visible, passing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quiet defiance theme emerges organically from hum vs. shout; "quiet hope humming into the divided world" offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting cosmic power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Celestial perceptual signature ("cosmic tricksters, bored immortals") biases noticing; rhythmic modulation from dread thrum to relief lean-back shows control under pressure, passing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in "low, gut-deep thrum" sensory image; varied rhythm avoids loops, no figurative muddle in climax, passing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subsonic counter to stellar whispers transforms invasion trope via lone interpreter's ingenuity; "hum" interference feels inevitable, with risk heightening stakes.</comment>
