<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as con artist's honest child roots every choice, with contradictory impulses peaking in the forging scene where she calls it "the most dishonest thing... most profoundly fair." Interiority concrete via atonement math; final gamble earned by backstory anchors. Minor embodiment slips in stress moments don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: backstory → plan → arrival/prep → paperwork/transport → envelope CR, with cost legible in "cold, hard math of her gamble." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene tight, no shards. Diagram reconfigures options undeniably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prep room constrains choices (tools for livor mortis, chemical packs) and charges closure via ink pot's ozonic scent. Sensory vivid/filtered (formaldehyde tang, ventilation whisper) reflects POV priorities. Ink pot as micro-setting recharges fair trade image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (balance ledger) signaled early, tightens via Silus arrival and forging choice narrowing moral options. Agency in prep/paperwork forecloses honest path with felt cost; gamble uncertainty charges ending. Causal escalation coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fair trade theme emerges organically from ink pot forging to graph paper CR, reweighting premise without moralizing. Diagram offers resonant non-literal answer, embracing atonement complexity. Particulars (cycloid curve) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (equilibrium math, sanctuary quiet); voice modulates rhythmically under prep stress. Minimal dialogue natural ("It is time"). No head-hopping, diction POV-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short prep sentences accelerate); no loops/artifacts, figurative purposeful ("porcelain stillness"). Propulsion peaks in forging beat without overwriting. Closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise transforms corpse-smuggling trope via atonement calculus and Ghost ink for undetectable forgery. Ink pot/curve synthesis inevitable; bold risk in moral breach heightens stakes organically.</comment>
