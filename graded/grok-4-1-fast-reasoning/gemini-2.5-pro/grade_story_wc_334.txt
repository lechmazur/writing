<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak perfectly in the claw's tremor against his non-interference rule, earning the interference choice with embodied nostalgia and ache as cost; chronic curiosity feels particular through decades of failed logs tilting to compulsion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under accumulative/textural lens, density builds from shimmer to violent fracture of Polaris, causal chain to touch yields memory key as Charged Poise closure with legible ache-cost in final image; orientation anchors crisply in opening paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Submersible arms and warped panes constrain sampling choice while charging final gaze from fungus to promising constellations; sensory selection (fogged glass, pulsing cap) narrows with urgency, vividly lived-in without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Anomaly tightening forecloses observation-only stance via nostalgia flood, agency in claw-touch reconfigures options with emotional ache as felt price; coherent pressure accumulates under textural lens to charged final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crisp nostalgia motif shifts from stolen summer to earned key without moralizing, final reweighting of "broken constellations" as promise answers persistence theme resonantly from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias (cipher-reading stars, frantic heartbeat sync) and rhythmic control modulate tension; diction like "spidery scrawl" for Polaris yields distinct, biased texture under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and read-aloud rhythm (e.g., "parting the water like a priest’s hand"); no loops, purposeful lyricism integrates without muddle even in peak touch beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken Fae orchard and constellation-cipher synthesize folklorist submersible into fresh, inevitable frame; risk of magic-science blend transforms tropes, heightening stakes in memory recovery without retreat.</comment>
