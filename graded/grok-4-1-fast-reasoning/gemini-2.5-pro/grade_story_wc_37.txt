<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's scattered mind flaw drives concrete micro-choices like tending ferns and vines to coax memory shards, embodying internal conflict as thorn-sharp recollections and heavy duty-cloak, culminating in earned wholeness at song's end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as acts accumulate song fragments into vortex and nascent sun; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with conceptual cost of bound duty released, charged by final radiance image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse flora (Sun-Drop Fern, Shadow-Vine, Moon-Petal) constrain choices by yielding lyrics, evolving with events; mica window reprises in climax peering to frame distorted dawn-hope, charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle realm) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via memory density to swaddling act that forecloses failure with fragile orb's pulse; agency crystallizes in voice-wrapping, cost felt in tender warmth's seepage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of broken memory birthing communal dawn emerges via particulars like pollen/spores weaving; final image reweights premise—single dawn promises future without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (melodies as yellow, lyrics thorn-sharp); rhythmic control modulates from drifting thinness to resonant vortex under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion (humid air, mossy flagstones) with no loops; figurative language (spider’s thread voice, vortex energy) coherent and pattern-taught for lyric alchemy payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-seeds, alchemical symbiosis, and song-woven dawn transforms fading-tree trope; risk-taking in accumulative shard-gathering inevitable to fragile star's release.</comment>
