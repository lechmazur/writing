<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen's balanced curiosity drives methodical data work into public stand, embodied in chain's shift from anchor to shackle; interior conflict subtle in superiors' chiding vs. obsession. Minor idealization limits contradictory impulses in peak council beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns emerge from data to holographic reveal; CR closure in council's stunned gaze reweights worldview with "profound sorrow" cost legible in final image. Orientation anchored early in city and Visitors' arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Benthic domes and abyssal plain constrain archives access, mirror internal shift; anchor as micro-setting charges final lectern image from grounding relic to "first link." Sensory hierarchy navigator-specific (cold iron, sonar sweeps).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (star navigation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pattern emergence forcing presentation risk; council reaction crystallizes with felt cost of prior smallness in hologram pull.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic expansion emerges implicitly via anchor/chain evolution and "unfolded horizons"; final hologram offers non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with navigator's perceptual bias (edges, currents); rhythmic prose modulates from somber reflection to charged speech. Brief quotes natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates setting into action (e.g., data feeds as canyon plots); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops, though minor hedge repetition ("he had to") nudges down.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of abyssal navigation to cosmic edges via geometry transforms tropes; chain reprise risks bold metaphor evolution heightening stakes inevitably.</comment>
