<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Compassionate recluse shines through embodied empathy (heart as frantic bird) and micro-choices like dissolving into the library, with contradictory fear/longing driving the earned realization; final invitation-smoothing renunciation forecloses isolation with felt relational cost. Interiority particular, no stock epiphanies until dramatized. Blind spots (assuming boisterous energy) compound then resolve organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory/emotional density building to Conceptual Repricing closure: invitation left as admission reconfigures solitude with undeniable opportunity cost in the final "staying while leaving" image. Single scene anchored early (Athenaeum via laundromat); no orientation debt. One tightening via detached observation narrows flawed logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Library setting (vellum scent, green-shaded lamp, hidden entrance) vividly filters through recluse's priorities, constraining hide-action and charging final "library’s embrace" image. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under stress (clock chime to click); spatial choreography coherent (alcove distance). Micro-setting (tome filigree) mirrors internal alchemy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (unearth mistake's wisdom) signaled via invitation, tightens accumulatively through hide-observation-deepening that forces stance crystallization; cost legible in loneliness transmuted yet shelter-nonempty acceptance. Agency in perceptual shift/endurance forecloses empty-solitude path. No reversal needed under lens; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Paradoxes emerge implicitly from particulars (solitude curdles, shelter nonempty), final image non-literally answers connection-without-storm via shared silent purpose. Subtext in Elara's sorrow-clutch resonates without moralizing. Earned insight from struggle avoids platitudes; ambiguity lingers in enlarged tranquility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature (paradox-noticing, sensory dissolution); rhythmic modulation builds lyric density under stress. Voice distinct, prose-as-mind reflects recluse's fevered spirit. No head-hopping; elisions (Elara's quest) paid via irony-charged observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (sensory propulsion into hide-beat); rhythm varies, no loops though "paradox" recurs purposefully. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("psychic hailstorm," "silent clarity of a sunrise") but coherent, pattern-taught; closure image crisp. Varied syntax breathes with scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empathy overload and "staying while leaving" in secret library transforms recluse trope; risk in lyric Accumulative closure heightens stakes via perceptual hide. Non-obvious angle on connection (shared non-interaction) inevitable from particulars. No derivative echoes.</comment>
