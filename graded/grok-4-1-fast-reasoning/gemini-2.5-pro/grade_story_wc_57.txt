<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's infinite patience embodied in slow tracing of strands and three-day defiance reveals character under subtle pressure; motivation to preserve methods drives micro-choices without stock epiphanies. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits to very strong, as serenity dominates without raw internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from rope examination to knot-as-phrase realization, with CR closure in "Understanding bloomed... philosophy of perception" reweighting premise; fog's invasion anchors orientation early and charges cost of isolation. No disorientation or lens ambiguity; persistent solitude constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dock's frosted planks, fulgurite abrasions, and fog tendrils constrain decoding choices and mirror internal attunement; sensory hierarchy (hush, flakes, vibrations) narrows with fog's crisis, charging final receding image. POV-biased selection avoids catalogs, integrating via goal-directed action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode/preserve knot) signaled early tightens via fog pressure and puzzle shift ("not a single knot, but a sequence"), narrowing options with patience's felt cost; agency in coaxing forecloses force, but lacks deeper trade-off at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of humble preservation emerges organically from knot's encoded philosophy and final journal sketch reweighting artifacts as civilizations; subtext in fog's witness avoids moralizing, lingering via conceptual cost of lost ways.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (energy echoes, tidal memory) modulates rhythm to quiet intensity; diction/rhythm heightens fog's invasion without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and read-aloud rhythm syncing to hush; purposeful metaphors (lightning root, hardened fist) cohere without muddle, though minor ornate flourishes in setup slightly pad pre-peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fulgurite lens decoding knots as tidal language transforms relic-hunting trope; risk in lyric patience pays off in CR closure, feeling inevitable via established attunement.</comment>
