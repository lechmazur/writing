<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in inheritance intensifies compellingly to closure realization; interiority particular to artist via murals and intuition. Minor abstraction in embodied emotion ("profound, umbral tenderness") slightly detaches peak without full contradiction in impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from postcard to layered reveals tightening knowledge; CR closure lands on-page in portrait with generational conceptual cost legible in "thread of shared passion." Orientation anchored early; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cathedral window and filters constrain choices, charging final image; sensory hierarchy artist-filtered (light/shadow over broad visuals). Micro-setting (etched layers) mirrors internal discovery without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bloom mystery) signaled early, Accumulative escalation via filter-deepening narrows to cosmic/inheritance revelation with felt patience cost; agency in light choreography forecloses simple curiosity path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of nocturnal strength emerges organically from layers to CR, reweighting premise in final image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in starlit roots and inheritance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (light/color as muralist); rhythmic modulation builds lyric intensity, purposeful compression taught early and legible at CR closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulative beats; minor overwriting in metaphors ("bruised sky") in setup but no loops or artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious layered-glass method transforms inheritance trope into fresh cosmic-botanical synthesis; risk in lyric structure heightens revelation without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
