<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. proceeding) act vividly in scene; final valve turn earned by internalized guilt, with embodied cost in exhaustion. "I poured all of its crushing weight into the wheel" reveals hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sounds and radio callers densify to charged silence post-valve closure (RR via Earned Stasis). Orientation anchored immediately in tunnel post-confession; cost legible in "bone-deep, earned exhaustion."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Beaded valve wheel and oily water constrain choice and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (clang, hiss, rust) narrows under crisis. "Frigid, beaded valve wheel" mirrors internal pressure, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lighten swallowed truth) signaled early, escalates via density (presence focuses, valve resists) under accumulative lens; agency in forcing wheel forecloses ghostly blame with legible cost. Radio callers tighten via parallel guilt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of confronting inaction emerges organically from valve action paralleling confession; final hush reweights ghosts/own guilt without moralizing. Resonance in "found the measure of my own," tying particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature ("damp, devouring dark," skeptical lens on radio); rhythmic control heightens drowsy alertness to climax. Radio dialogue subtextual, advances via frantic parallels.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels without loops; metaphors coherent ("sleeping iron beasts"). No artifacts dull closure; "groan of tortured metal" vivid in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: radio psychics as lens transforms factory ghosts into proxy for personal inaction; valve turn risks bold payoff from particulars. Non-obvious kinship with callers heightens stakes.</comment>
