<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong character-specific interiority through needlework embodiment and intuition tracing possibilities; micro-choices like encoding stars reveal values under pressure. Minor slip: internal conflict summarized ("pictured...rehearsal") rather than impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal transmission beat. Final endurance (return to stitching) earned with felt risk cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: clue density builds to cadence shift at transmission confirmation glyph. Charged Poise closure on-page ("message was away") with legible cost in heart-stopping lag and closing window. Orientation anchored early; single scene fits scope, one tightening via calibration opportunity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Eternal candle as micro-setting charges final image and constrains perception throughout; dome groan and dusty terminal guide transmission choice tactilely. Sensory hierarchy (flame's light on fingers, low groan) reflects POV urgency; autumn cold mirrors conspiracy chill without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose coup) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via clue density to agency-driven transmission narrowing options. Lag moment delivers felt cost charging final poise; moral calculus in risking disguise vs. action legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of unheard stories emerges organically from embroidery encoding and final "silence...filled with a new echo"; resonant non-literal answer in eyes reflected in flame reweights premise. Subtext in "ghost-stitch" possibilities avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (cosmic tapestry lens); rhythmic prose modulates from meditative to tense at console. Compression in intuition beats taught early, paid off legibly at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with stitching metaphors patterned consistently without muddle; rhythm varies (short lag sentence amid longer flows). Minor paraphrase in conspiracy threads ("discordant notes...wrong color"), but no loops touching closure; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroiderer-spy encoding coup map in nebula silk transforms conspiracy trope; final image inevitability grows from particulars. Risky intuition method heightens stakes organically.</comment>
