<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation as penance and meaning-making drives precise micro-choices like "gently meticulous touch" and desperate tuning; embodied cold (breath fogging) and whisper ("Hold") reveal character under fading pressure without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from retrieval to erratic pulsing and final nova capture as CR with cost (slide inert, vow logged as equation); orientation anchored immediately in archive and task.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen spire and "quartz hush" constrain actions (chilled vault, ice-glazed floor) and charge final window image of churning clouds; sensory hierarchy (hush vs. hum/scream) reflects urgency, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture resonance) signaled early, escalates via fraying projection and "scattering frequencies" under accumulative lens; agency in tuning forecloses loss with legible cost (light dies, but frequency saved).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging essences emerges from vow's death-to-equation arc; final ledger line and cloud gaze offer resonant CR reweighting oblivion into "lexicon of essences" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Close third-person POV stable with perceptual bias toward lights/readouts; voice texture ("cartographer of a collapsing reality") modulates rhythmically from hush to scream, distinct and pressure-attuned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated metaphors ("guttering candle," "failing heartbeat") without muddle or loops; rhythm varies (short desperate sentences in peak), closure image crisp.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fading magic archived as physics in isolated spire transforms end-times trope; vow-to-frequency turn feels inevitable from particulars, bold without gimmick.</comment>
