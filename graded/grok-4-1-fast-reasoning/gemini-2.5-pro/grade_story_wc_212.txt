<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction in "furiously tranquil" pulse against chaos enables calm gathering, earning final realization; micro-choices like inviting threads reveal values. Minor lack of deeper internal conflict acting simultaneously prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of gathered shards tightening to closure's Resonant Reconfiguration (CR in "cool, living water over ancient stone"); cost legible in effort to anchor dying legacy. Orientation anchored early in atrium post-hatching.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystalline frost and starlight fractals constrain gathering action and charge final serene reflection; sensory selection (buzzing air, cooling acorn) mirrors internal shift purposefully. Body as micro-setting in pulse anchors perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend vortex) signaled early, escalates via density of shards slowing chaos under Accumulative lens, narrowing to final push with felt effort cost. Protagonist agency in inviting/coaxing forecloses erasure path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of order from chaos emerges organically through gathering memories, resonant CR reweights inheritance without moralizing; final chorus of lives answers question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in synesthetic details (ozone scent, first-kiss feeling); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "snowflakes on a warm tongue" patterned for entropy theme, varying rhythm propels; minor figurative density in peak gathering risks overwrite but pays off without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh metaphysical gardening premise with entropy mechanics transforms inheritance trope; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable CR feels earned from particulars.</comment>
