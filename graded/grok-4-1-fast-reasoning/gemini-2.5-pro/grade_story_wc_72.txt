<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between mission certainty and emerging nuance act simultaneously in her turmoil and hesitation with the ampoule; final renunciation earned via Galen's projections and gill revelation. Interiority particular and embodied in "turmoil in her chest" and "aching clarity." Flaw of indoctrination confronts cost in burying certainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelation density builds to cadence shift in burial as Earned Stasis with conceptual cost of shattered beliefs legible in "burying the lie" and vine pulse. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in city garden and mission. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent flora, pearl paths, and gill membrane constrain choice and charge final image, mirroring internal shift from tomb to cradle. Sensory hierarchy narrows to rebreather hiss and swirling ampoule under crisis. Spatial choreography tracks swim to plinth cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mission vs. truth signaled early tightens via deepening revelations narrowing to renunciation; agency in burying ampoule forecloses path with felt cost of lost certainty. Escalation coherent under accumulative lens, pressure crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of certainty as cage emerges organically from poison lie and gill truth, reweighted in final burial image without moralizing. Vine pulse offers resonant non-literal answer, charging nuance over righteousness with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in "sculpted stone and patient coral" projections; rhythmic prose modulates from calm pressure to decisive burial. Telepathy reads as clean free indirect, distinct from narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering like "captive nebula" advancing image and momentum; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts, even in peak burial beat. Rhythm varies for propulsion, syntax supports underwater stasis to action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living statue telepathy and poison-as-piracy in vibrant underwater garden transforms tropes; risk in lyric revelations heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via gill reversal. Non-obvious moral calculus on "purifier" lie.</comment>
