<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zen potter's motivation roots in "stubborn question" and potter's intuition, driving micro-choices like watering the rose and shaping clay, with embodied hands revealing character under building pressure. Final act weaves his care into the oasis, earning change with felt effort cost. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in observation-to-action shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: thrum density increases via glass visions and kindness acts, culminating in CR closure—"His purpose now clear"—repricing resistance as accumulated care, with conceptual cost of integration legible in final clay-laying image. Orientation anchored early in arrival and camp. One tightening via rose-watering dissolves world into past.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (thrum in marrow, honey scent, waxy thyme) filter through potter's bias, with alluvial clay and collapsed channel constraining rebuild choice. Glass as recurring micro-setting charges visions, mirroring internal states without overt symbols. Final peace silence evolves environment causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding resistance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via rose act triggering visions, deepening to channel repair that swells thrum to chord, narrowing to realization with on-page costs (forgetting food/night). Agency in compassionate acts forecloses passive observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of kindness anchoring time emerges organically from rose vision and clay repair, with final image—"each one a thread weaving a tapestry"—offering non-literal CR reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars like spectral beekeepers charge resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, with perceptual signature (light angles, clay memory) and rhythmic modulation suiting zen potter; diction purposeful, compressing lyric density without elision. Prose reflects embodied deliberation, e.g., "quiet deliberation of water finding its level."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, with metaphors coherent (clay wheel memory) and no loops/artifacts; peak beats like "world dissolved" vivid without overwriting. Opening anchors stakes, closing recharges via "profound silence."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phototropic timelines and potter's clay repair transforms wasteland trope into inevitable CR; risk in lyric fantasy heightens stakes without gimmickry, voice/setting cohere authentically.</comment>
