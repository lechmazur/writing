<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through mapping and flowing power, with embodied calm ("tranquil blaze burned... placid inferno") particular to her. Interiority concrete via sensory reach to prophecy gaps, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—no visible struggle or micro-choice hierarchy in the flawless ritual climax. Final endurance as guardian earned by prior focus, with cost in fragile outcome.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence density builds from brook baseline to mapped voids expanding/merging to swallow echoes. On-page RR (Charged Poise) in "last echo... faded... fragile blanket," with legible conceptual cost of muting vs. erasing. Orientation anchored early ("kneelt in her nocturnal haven beside a quiet brook"); single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moss-covered stone and origami wing constrain ritual (fulcrum, saturation); brook's murmur baselines noise and bookends clean sound, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (past murmurs to prophecy voids) reflects her priorities; details tactile/lived ("cool and heavy like river stone"). Atmosphere tensions hush amid "insidious rustle," mirroring internal blaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via faltering whispers to planetary unwind, narrowing to stasis. Agency in guiding tide along mapped paths forces trade-off (absorb vs. attack). Cost felt in "fragile blanket... asleep," charging poise, but no live option explicitly foreclosed mid-ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of absorbing chaos into peace emerges organically from silence-mapping and offering, not statement; prophecy gaps shift to swallowing network. Final image ("air settled... whispers threatened to grow loud again") offers resonant CR repricing hush as temporary guardianship cost. Complexity in delicate vs. dire avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature (noticing sound voids, energy as "river stone"); voice texture lyrical yet controlled, modulating rhythm with intensity ("tide, rising... pushed the flow outward"). No dialogue or head-hopping; diction biased to her cosmic-terrestrial lens.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short ritual breaths amid longer mappings); density high, lines multi-job (e.g., "energy, cool and heavy like river stone, saturated... grew denser"). Minor overwrite in peak ("profound and overwhelming peace... pockets... expanded, merging") risks figurative density without muddle, but no loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: silence-cartography via origami channeling terrestrial-cosmic hush transforms prophecy trope into absorbing stasis. Risk in lyric ritual scale heightens planetary stakes organically; "paper-thin key folded from starlight and prayer" inevitable in hindsight, no template echoes.</comment>
