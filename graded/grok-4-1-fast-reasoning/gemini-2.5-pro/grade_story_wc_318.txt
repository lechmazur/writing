<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ghost's "mournfully eager" trait drives concrete micro-choices like gathering sorrow into the third pull, earning the final softening of his roar; contradictory impulses of helplessness and love act simultaneously without alternation. Wife's twitch-smile reveals relational crucible under spectral pressure. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing flattens interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sound density builds from cough to echo chamber roar, culminating in Charged Poise closure via wife's recognizing smile—cost legible in her tear and fragile start. Orientation anchored early in house post-death. Single tightening via engine ignition narrows options without micro turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Leaf blower and "long, tiled hallway" echo chamber constrain choices, amplifying lullaby to charge wife's final recognition. Sensory hierarchy favors sound, mirroring ghost's perceptual bias; dust motes and faded housing ground tactile decay. No white-room; spatial choreography tracks cleanly from garage to tunnel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore laughter—tightens accumulatively as engine catches, forcing family reactions and wife's stance crystallization; cost felt in brittle leaves shredded as grief symbols. Agency in guiding gale shreds neglect without coincidence resolution. Pressure coheres to reweight options in fragile smile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of love haunting via noise emerges organically from lullaby-distorted wind, reweighting silence-to-roar arc without statement; final seed-planting image answers unspoken grief non-literally. Subtext in "phantom melody" layers memory over rage. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in pained smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice modulates rhythmically with intensity—short cough sentences to roaring drone—via ghost's sound-biased perception; POV stable without leakage. Prose texture distinct in "gale-force wind" syntax echoing machinery. No dialogue; compression purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines like "spectral fingers... wrapped around the plastic grip" advance character/action/atmosphere without loops or scaffolds. Rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion peaks in engine surge; metaphors cohere without muddle. Zero paraphrase churn; opening anchors stakes tightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope into "leaf blower symphony conductor" with fresh synthesis of mourning noise and folk lullaby, inevitable in hindsight; risk of mechanical haunting heightens emotional stakes. No template echoes; bold conceit commits fully without retreat.</comment>
