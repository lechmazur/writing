<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation roots in love outliving its object, compelling the integration choice over deletion; contradictory impulses act in rejecting slash-and-burn while embracing shadow. Interiority embodied via river stone's weight and warmth. Final whisper and sequence earn change with felt cost of permanent regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build to shadow's origin, tightening to integration (DC/RR). Orientation anchors early (Lumina-Arbor, Kael, Elara's archive). Closure lands on-page with reconfiguration cost in silvery blue vines and abiding sorrow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library's light-vines and pearl console constrain choices; river stone as micro-setting conduit charges tactics and final image (warms post-integration). Sensory details selective via Kael's dusk-noticing bias (hologram gestures, twilight clouds). Final window view evolves with causal revival.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve Elara whole) signaled early, deepens via comparison revealing dream-origin shadow, narrowing to integration agency. Escalation accumulates texturally in hours of clips, forcing trade-off with cost legible in hologram's real smile breaking to sorrow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of embracing darkness for whole light emerges organically from integration, not statement; final hologram softening to fragile beauty offers non-literal resonant answer. Complexity in accepting trauma's price avoids tidy moral. Silvery blue dawn-tinged frost reweights prior blight image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature in subtle discords (finger curl, smile mask). Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates intensity, compressing elegantly at peak sequence without elision. Voice particular: dusk metaphors bias noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" embeds trait/action); metaphors coherent (poisonous vine/rose → silvery blue). No loops/artifacts; rhythm varies for propulsion, accelerating in comparisons to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dream-archive garden with unbound shadow transforms preservation trope via subtle comparison/integration. Risk in rejecting erasure for costly embrace heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious final warmth in stone feels inevitable hindsight.</comment>
