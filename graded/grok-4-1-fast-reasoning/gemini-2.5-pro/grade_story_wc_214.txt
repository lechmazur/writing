<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and embodied emotion peak in the meteor empathy ("felt the violent, frictional heat"), earning the final change with contradictory isolation-glory impulses; single flaw is minor reflective summary early, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from ritual observation to CR closure ("dust was simply the memory of light"); one tightening at Perseids decision pays off with felt cost in embraced fragility; orientation anchored immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Yellow glass as micro-setting constrains ritual choice and charges final hands/dust image; selective cosmic sensory hierarchy (starlight drifts, hush) mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (strength in vulnerability) signaled early, escalates via empathy agency deepening to glory with legible cost ("holds nothing back"); accumulative tightening sufficient, no slips at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (stars' burn to dust memory), final image non-literally reweights premise without moralizing; resonant CR inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (seeker in dust) with rhythmic modulation under stress; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops; peak empathy beat clean of artifacts, figurative language purposeful ("final brushstroke") without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of janitor-star empathy transforms tropes via glass ritual and CR; risk-taking in perceptual plunge heightens stakes organically.</comment>
