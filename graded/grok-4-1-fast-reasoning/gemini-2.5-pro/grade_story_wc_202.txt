<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in honoring histories drives all choices, embodied via lens weight; interiority concrete and particular, with micro-choice to use lens under market pull. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in scene flattens peak struggle, but endurance of method earns closure change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building intuition to revelation; single scene with clear orientation by market arrival. Closure as RR/Charged Poise lands on-page in "true seascape shone" and lighter lens, with felt cost undeniable in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (linseed oil/ozone, filtered light) filter through POV bias, guiding to tent/painting. Lens as micro-setting constrains choice and charges final image ("felt suddenly lighter"), meeting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reveal hidden history) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via deliberate errors to unfastening; agency in focusing lens forecloses concealment with legible cost in painting shift and lens lightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked truths emerges organically from lens/painting particulars, final image ("history... at peace") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting intuition's power without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with distinct perceptual signature ("space between grounded and ethereal"); rhythmic prose modulates to intensity in "eternal instant," no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and propulsion; purposeful lyric metaphors integrated without muddle or loops, though minor recurrence of "anchor" borders template but pays off. No scaffold obscures closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical market, lens-revealing underpainting transforms trope of hidden truths into ingenious method; risk in ethereal causality heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
