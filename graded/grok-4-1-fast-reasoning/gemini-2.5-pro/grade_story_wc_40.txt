<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's reticent traits drive patient decoding via micro-choices like charting fragments, earning the final renunciation of publication with visible cost in his transformed purpose; interiority particular via "folded into question mark" embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from crystal's chaos to patterned web, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure—"He could not write this discovery down"—reconfiguring "finished world" premise with cost of silent testimony legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shadowed library and dawn prism anchor early, crystal as micro-setting constrains listening choice and charges final cupped-palms image; sensory hierarchy (hum over visuals) reflects scholarly POV without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode growth) signaled early, Accumulative deepening via "recurring cadences" across weeks narrows to renunciation with felt cost of rejecting publication, though single tightening limits peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of process-over-product emerges organically from sonic mosaic to "growth was the process, not the product," final oracle image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting stasis of language without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature ("thrum of a hidden pulse") modulates from analytical to "profound and innocent wonder"; rhythmic control heightens quiet pressure without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax ("fat teardrop... thud" sonic image); no loops, purposeful figurative layering taught early pays off in closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sonic crystal in "finished language" world synthesizes fresh conceptual frame, transformed tropes (library stasis) via "Rosetta Stone of acoustic history" heighten stakes in quiet ending payoff.</comment>
