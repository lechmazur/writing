<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation to discover meaning drives micro-choices like pouring sand, rooted in whimsy vs. despair; socially perceptive trait shines in reading wanderers' "slump of a shoulder like a paragraph of loss." Internal conflict emerges subtly in preferring patterns to void, earning the final offering. Minor deduction for archetypal artist without deeper flaws complicating the peak mandala beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early and holds: density builds from tile flake spark to mandala's golden spirals drawing wanderers. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in "fragile, shared focus" shifting atmosphere, with cost legible in unbroken hush versus new communion ("gritty texture of sand on her knees grounding her"). Orientation anchored by ~100 words in grotto during unlearning; one tightening via tile solidifies resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto's mist and lost acoustics constrain sonic failure, forcing visual mandala; tile flake recurs to charge center image. Sensory hierarchy via Elara's artist lens: "damp curve," "lavender-grey shroud," gritty knees integrate with action. Final image of gleaming tile amid sand recharges acoustics motif purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interject meaning into hush) signaled early, tightens texturally as wanderers near mandala's spirals, narrowing to visual possibility amid silence. Agency in deliberate pouring forecloses shout option with embodied cost ("paint-stained fingers"); pressure coheres to Charged Poise without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of patterns-from-chaos emerges organically from jagged black/grey to violet/gold mandala, resonating in final "starting point" image without moralizing. Subtext in tile's "ghost of forgotten language" reweights hush as symptom, not end; invites ambiguity in persistent silence versus communion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: artist's eye traces "intricate logic" in others' gazes. Voice texture modulates poetically ("soundless scream held in the collective throat") without head-hopping; purposeful compression in reactions builds to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with vivid rhythm, but overwriting in mandala build ("jagged, frantic lines... intricate, spiraling patterns") mixes metaphors slightly, dulling peak propulsion; minor synonym churn on hush/silence ("emergent hush... pervasive emergent hush"). Closure image clear despite; varied syntax supports textural rise.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of unlearning-era hush with chalk artist's sand mandala interjects whimsy into despair, transforming silence trope via tile flake's resonance; risk in wordless communion heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
