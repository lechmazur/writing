<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in past clumsy hands versus surgeon's precision compel weaving choices; final fulfillment earned via process with cost of irrecoverable sound. Snowmelt ardor embodies passion against frost without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: weaving density builds to sigil's Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "he hadn't brought back the sound" as light honors memory. Orientation anchored early in sanctum/aurora; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ice dome, rope braids, aurora constrain weaving and charge sigil image; sensory hierarchy (cool strands, phosphorescent glow) reflects Elian's priorities. Final pearlescent radiance evolves causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve Lyra's name) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through reconfiguration; cost unmistakable in silent sigil versus lost sound. Minor slip: no explicit live option foreclosed mid-process.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness-fueled preservation emerges via sigil as "memory made manifest"; final wax sketch reweights failure with non-literal resonance. No moralizing; ambiguity in light-not-sound lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "holes a ghost of a forgotten melody"; rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, stable third-limited POV. No dialogue; elision of sound absent but paid in light payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (hours bleed via aurora); zero loops, varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors like "river of captured starlight" cohere without muddle. Closure image clear, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wax-casting to name-weaving via kelp rope transforms preservation trope; risk in lyric process heightens stakes organically. Sigil as sound-architecture inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
