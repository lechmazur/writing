<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in platitudes questioned amid collapse ("Why fight the current?"), earning the final cartographer shift with embodied cost in the persistent glow; interiority particular via fragmented sight. No therapy-speak flattens peaks. Flawless single-POV execution under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from box discovery to spiral map, cadence-shifting closure as RR (Charged Poise) with felt cost in softened ache; orientation anchored by para 1; no shards needed, causality intact in redesign process.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via room materials (atlas thread, rope) shaping map tactics; lighthouse spiral mirrors internal geography, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (dust taste, groaning boards) reflects crisis narrowing. Micro-setting elevates to 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (perceptual fragmentation) tightens texturally via work hours, narrowing to endurance/redesign agency; cost legible in receding walls/quiet mind, but minor abstractness in platitudes slightly mutes visceral peak before map.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from fragments-to-map arc, final image resonating non-literally on navigating chaos with transformed ache; rhetorical questions reweight platitudes without moralizing. No thematic echo dilutes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (features "swimming in a void"); rhythmic control modulates from heavy silence to quiet glow; no elision or head-hopping. Lyrical diction fits fractured artist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short groan/long sweep); metaphors coherent (carousel to spiral) without muddle in peak redesign beat. Minor density in opening metaphors avoids overwrite penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artist block as soul-cartography in lighthouse, tarot fragments reweighted organically; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes without gimmick. Transformation inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
