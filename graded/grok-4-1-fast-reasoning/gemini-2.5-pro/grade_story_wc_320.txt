<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied despair yielding to defiant micro-choices like jury-rigging the fragment; contradictory impulses peak in pushing away from console amid familiar dread. Final endurance of struggle earned via mentor's lesson anchoring her reconfiguration. No safety-hedging; flaws like assumption-blindness drive competent yet tense struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup through discarded assumptions to inverted gain, culminating in on-page Charged Poise as hush carves static, reweighting silence with cost in "coiled spring of reality." Orientation anchored early in tower perch over gorge. One tightening sufficient; closure cost legible in overwhelmed system and prior despair.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via perigee-amplified chaos and groaning tower threatening overwhelm during climax adjustment. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: electric air, fragment hum, headphone void. Final image charges "city of towers... waiting," mirroring internal hush. Micro-object (fragment) as setting evolves tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush amid chaos) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via failed protocols to defiant tuning under perigee pressure, narrowing to null-point hunt. Agency in discarding assumptions forces trade-off, cost felt in flickering console and carved void. One decisive deepening charges closure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of endings cradling beginnings emerges organically from hush as "gap between exhale and inhale," reweighting fragment's violent birth. Final image offers non-literal resonance: silent city "waiting," tying cosmic hush to personal proof without moralizing. Particulars like supernova sliver avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in cosmic idiom ("swollen pearl," "ghost-whispers"); syntax modulates from despairing flow to clipped urgency in "fingers flew." Rhythmic control heightens pressure in climax whine-to-void. No elision issues; voice distinct and biased toward signal patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "roaring static didn't just stop; it was carved away"); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful and coherent, like "tuning fork next to a string," without muddle in peak hush beat. Clean propulsion to charged closure image.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of supernova relic as silence-key transforms listening tropes via "fantasy practicality." Fresh hush-as-substance reweights sci-fi signals organically. Risky abstract stakes heightened by grounded jury-rig, inevitable in hindsight without template echoes.</comment>
