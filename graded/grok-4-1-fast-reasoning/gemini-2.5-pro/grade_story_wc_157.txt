<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to guard defiance drives consistent traits and higher-stakes choice at orchid insertion; interiority concrete via dread converging with city anxiety. Aris applies targeted pressure on syntax risks. Final shedding of facade feels earned by prior charm as shield.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: probes learning roots therefore seed insertion warps grid; orientation anchored in garden by para 1. Closure as Decisive Change lands on-page with cost in "theoretical madness" risking blocks. One tightening via sirens suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains climax via orchid receptacle and insects as messengers; sensory hierarchy sharpens under dread (buzzing thickened air). Wilting sunflower charges opening spark, recurring in silenced thought. Micro-setting via gourd seed alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defiance vs. probes) signaled early, tightens causally via Aris warning and sirens to warp agency; cost legible in block-wipe risk and warped light. Protagonist choice forecloses whisper path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of untaxable spark emerges via floral defiance to silence; final unguarded smile reweights premise without moral. Resonance from particulars like seed splice, no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (melodious hum, psychic buzz); voice textured via cryptic diction modulating to feverish at "screaming." Dialogue subtextual, Aris fear advances plot naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, rhythm varies (short hum at climax); minor density slip in stacked metaphors ("daggers wrapped in silk") but purposeful for voice, no closure touch. Zero loops, strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxable thoughts, pollen secrets, chronophage warp feels inevitable; risk in madness gambit heightens stakes organically, transforms dystopia tropes via gardens.</comment>
