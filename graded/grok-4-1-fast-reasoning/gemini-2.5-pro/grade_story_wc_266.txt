<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots clearly in the leash's fraying, with embodied fear yielding to micro-choices like following the indirect path; guides apply secondary pressure effectively. Final realization of courage as "a muscle to be flexed" earns through journey but borders on overt epiphany, slightly unearned without deeper prior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to Conceptual Repricing in the star ticket pulsing with heartbeat and Elara's turn into mist, with legible cost of solitude. Orientation anchors early in vigil; one tightening via ticket imprints readiness, parting mists.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway and mist constrain path choices, jasmine scent/textural details guide navigation; final promontory "edge of the sky" charges closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's emerging resolve, parting mists via "willingness to see."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding courage signaled in opening vigil, deepens accumulatively through indirect traverse and ticket confirming "readiness to choose"; agency in final step forecloses ghost-world behind. Cost felt in "shadow long and steady" alone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of courage as repeated choice emerges via journey particulars and ticket reprise, final image non-literally reweights premise without moralizing. Star pulsing with heartbeat offers resonant answer to unused courage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in sea-infused lyricism (e.g., "purple ink bleeding"); dialogue sparse, subtextual ("path is open"). Rhythmic control heightens quiet pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm without loops; metaphors cohere (sea motifs) in peak beats like kelp ticket. Minor overwriting in opening twilight descriptors but purposeful for textural lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kelp ticket with star imprint transforms ferry trope into fresh conceptual device; indirect routes and fraying leash synthesize poetic ingenuity, risking lyric over plot without obscuring closure.</comment>
