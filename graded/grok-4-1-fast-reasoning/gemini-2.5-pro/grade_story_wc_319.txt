<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in portal moment ("screamed to leap" vs. "betrayal of the stillness"), embodied in feral growl and patient waiting; final renunciation earned by prior homesick endurance with visible cost to self-identity. Minor abstract phrasing like "profound homesickness" borders diagnostic but anchors concretely to garden frost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of temptation builds to pattern break at portal; on-page Earned Stasis closure ("poured his own longing into it") reconfigures waiting with legible emotional cost in "sorrowful sigh" and persisting ache. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no shard violations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen garden and mist constrain choice (nudges pendant warily, gazes at library stones during portal); recurring pendant charges final dead-metal image, mirroring internal fog. Sensory hierarchy feral-specific (ozone smell vs. clean hum), integrated via action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (homesick return vs. guardianship) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pendant whispers to portal wound; agency in smothering ritual forecloses path with cost (home vision dissolves). Inciting intruder cry and climax jolt legible, but cultists off-page slightly mutes external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges organically from interiorizing frost/mist to final "peace with the fog"; resonant non-literal answer in reweighted ache (void to companion) recharges prior garden motifs without moralizing. Complexity in refusal's ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (shadowy senses, dimensional ache bias); rhythmic modulation peaks at portal "violent clarity," diction foggy-lucid and feral-motivated. No elision or head-hopping; prose reflects mind's fraying resolve.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, varied rhythm accelerates to portal; overwrought metaphors ("weeping icy tears," "watercolor in rain") cohere texturally without muddling climax. Minor synonym churn ("mist and fog") purposeful for lens, but risks scaffold in temptation cycle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of feral guardian's "interiorizing exteriors" transforms homesick trope via pendant corruption; risk in quiet stasis refusal heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight from opening ache. No derivative echoes.</comment>
