<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in eons of boredom calcifies into purpose during climax, overriding curse's agony in "He did not fight the curse; he embraced it"; contradictory impulses act on-page with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm density builds to rift's CR with conceptual cost in final step; orientation anchored early in escondite/storm; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prismatic walls and storm's "angry crimson and violet" constrain ritual and charge final scattering light; sensory hierarchy narrows to rift's "unreflective blackness" under crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (endless life) tightens via amulet's flare forcing embrace; agency in will-weaving escalates under lens with legible cost in curse's "agonizing weight."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of final goodbye emerges via rift image reweighting immortality premise; resonant non-literal answer in "not-knowing... thrill," inextricable from arc without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with cosmic perceptual signature; diction/rhythm modulate from hum to "growl" under pressure, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; minor figurative density ("spatial mutiny") coherent and pattern-taught, undulling peak rift image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic ennui and self-wrought oblivion via spatial refusal; risk in CR payoff feels inevitable from provoked storm, transforming immortality trope.</comment>
