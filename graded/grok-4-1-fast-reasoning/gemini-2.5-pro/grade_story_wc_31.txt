<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradiction—gear checks as "wall against the terrifying enormity"—earns the vow's fulfillment; flaws like hiding behind facts complicate the dive without safety-hedging. Final realization stems from prior micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via descent's deepening density to CR closure ("deep, resonant indigo, blooming and fading"); orientation anchored by pier/lanterns in first paragraph; cost legible in exhaustion and ten-year foreclosure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pier lamps, wreck corridors, and drifting books constrain dive tactics and charge library silence; sensory hierarchy (salt spray to "liquid night") mirrors emotional narrowing. Final surfacing recharges lantern motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover sound's color) signaled early, tightens texturally via library float and light-off; agency in stillness forecloses paths with physical/emotional cost ("exhausted and calm"); enters 8.8+ via charged final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of luminous vows emerges organically from vow-memory to indigo realization, reweighting silence-as-seeing without moralizing; final image non-literally answers "what color was that chord?" via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in light/music synesthesia selective; rhythmic modulation peaks in "meteor hush" to library darkness without filter excess or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion—"small, temporary star against the deepening twilight"—varies rhythm naturally; no loops, purposeful metaphors integrate without muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sunken library as silence-vault transforms grief-dive trope via sound-color synthesis; indigo Bach suite feels inevitable from vow particulars, risking lyric interiority payoff.</comment>
