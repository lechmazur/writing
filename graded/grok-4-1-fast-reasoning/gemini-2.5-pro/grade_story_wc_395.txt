<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Obsessive motivation rooted in brother's absence drives frantic pattern hunt and lie to Kael, with embodied stress ("heart hammered") revealing contradiction between safety and truth-seeking; final forwarding earns closure via prior risk accumulation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds from glitch "7" to "Seraphim71123" password unlocking Void; orientation anchored in first paragraph; DC closure in forwarding post with conceptual cost of truths escaping, legible in "shot out of the archive."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Digital "silent city" and "server noise" constrain bypass via architecture; patch as recurring object charges final image, mirroring internal absence; POV filters details through archival urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of digital cages for truths emerges via pattern map and unsent post; final "brought back into the light" reweights archive premise without moralizing, resonant via patch reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in "brightly attentive" pattern-spotting; voice texture via "digital gloom" and "ghost data" modulates pressure; lie dialogue evades with subtext, advancing plot cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesizes audio-tagged social net as psychological profiling scandal with brother's stellar coordinate map; fresh twist transforms janitor trope into whistleblower hunt, inevitable via Seraphim-7 patch linkage.</comment>
