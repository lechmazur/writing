<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied in drumming as "last untangled piece," with contradictory grief/love impulses acting in the escalating rhythm; final endurance of fused memory earned through prior micro-choices like silent sneaking, foreclosing isolation with felt cost in the tear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as drumming density builds light/memory fusion to Charged Poise closure; orientation anchored early in facility/white room; cost legible in "profound emptiness—the space beside her" reconfiguring the dream.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens via tactile drumming on "metal bedframe, water glass, knee" to slab vibrations; sound wave garden's emitters constrain creation and charge final lagoon image, mirroring internal fusion without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive dream) signaled early, escalates via rhythm "grew stronger, more complex" deepening light/memory under accumulative lens; agency in fingers "flew faster" forces trade-off, cost unmistakable in "tear-streaked face" and emptiness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of indelible love amid erasure emerges organically from entangled drumming/lagoon; final "duet for one" image offers resonant reconfiguration of fusion's beauty/sharpness without moralizing, reweighting premise via sorrow's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual bias toward rhythms ("frantic, joyful beat") modulates with intensity; diction/rhythm mirrors drumming propulsion, no elision or head-hopping obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from hesitant taps to "fingers flew faster"; minor figurative density in lagoon "currents of liquid light" purposeful and pattern-taught, no loops/artifacts dulling peak clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic grief/drumming as visual genesis transforms treatment trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in "perfect fusion created in the echo of her loss."</comment>
