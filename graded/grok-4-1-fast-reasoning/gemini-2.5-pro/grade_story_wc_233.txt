<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exemplary interior contradiction in simultaneous pull to dreams and felt warning, embodied in gloved hand reaching then recoiling; earned renunciation at "pulled her hand back" with visible cost of persistent disenchantment. Kael's grip forces micro-choice revealing hierarchy of duty over escape. No label-speak or tidy paths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory ascent builds to grotto pattern break, yielding CR closure in "Her life was a cage, but this was a void" with undeniable conceptual cost of duty's endurance. Orientation anchored early in climb from kingdom; single scene causality intact, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto's pulsing entrance and viscous starlight drops constrain pivotal reach/refusal, charging final image; sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis to light's hypnotic peril mirroring internal erosion. Purposeful selection (grit vs. silk) integrates with action, no white-room or checklists.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dreams vs. warning) signaled early tightens accumulatively to grotto vision narrowing options to erasure or duty; agency in hand-pull forecloses void-path with felt clarity cost. No static pressure; firefly pause deepens via contrast before peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of gilded cage vs. soul-void emerges organically from particulars like starlight-trapped faces; final "stand guard at its gates" offers non-literal CR reweighting escape's peril without moralizing. Subtext in lacy menace charges ambiguity of beauty's lure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with Elara's perceptual bias (polished emptiness vs. real grit); rhythmic diction modulates from wonder ("slow breath of weary wonder") to terse command under stress. Minimal dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("Your Majesty" hoarse with fear).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and integrated imagery (no loops or scaffolds); "shimmering, viscous drops... swirled in intricate, hypnotic patterns" coherent, non-muddled in peak. Zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms prophecy-quest trope via starlight dissolution's serene peril; irreplaceable grotto logic yields inevitable refusal. Risky lyric ascent heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
