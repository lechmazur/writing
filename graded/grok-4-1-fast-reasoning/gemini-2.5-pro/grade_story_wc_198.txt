<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation absolute and rooted in inherited duty, with embodied dread ("clench in his stomach") and micro-choices in note selection revealing sorrowful endurance. Limited simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene—dread noted but duty proceeds without friction—caps at strong rather than exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: prophecy whisper escalates density, music absorbs via sympathetic vibration, closure as Earned Stasis ("last echo...vanished") with legible conceptual cost in "eerie nostalgia...past he could feel but never fully grasp." Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in path/grotto.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto, prism atrium, mist/fungi glow constrain action (acoustic space starved, vibrations bend light) and charge final image (dewdrops "heavy and perfect"). Sensory hierarchy musical/ambient, POV-filtered (drips as code), evolves causally with music.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening (coded drips falter, absorbed into random water); agency in negative-space playing forecloses chaotic dawn with felt cost of "lonely vigil." One tightening sufficient, pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of preserving fragile memory/hush vs. disruptive code emerges organically from music absorbing prophecy, final image ("dewdrops...tiny, shimmering world") offers resonant CR reweighting nostalgia without moralizing. Particulars (light dance, vested hush) build complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (sounds as parasitic melody/boundary voids, light as visual hush); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates with intensity, purposeful compression legible under textural lens. No head-hopping, voice musically textured.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (long sentences frame pauses like music), propulsion weaves description into action; minor overwriting in "deliberate" repetitions purposeful for hush motif, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of saxophonist as prophecy-husher via negative space/prism vibration transforms guardian trope organically; risk in abstract sound-warfare heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from setup.</comment>
