<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied sensory details like "low, resonant frequency... behind his eyes"; final shift from dread to embrace earned through accumulated insight, revealing hierarchy of values. Minor abstraction in early motivation summary slightly detaches from micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from chimes to quartz symphony, yielding CR closure in "these were not random misfortunes; they were probable miracles" with felt cost of reframed purpose. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest vividly constrains navigation via "high-pitched whistle... low thrum"; quartz tree charges final image, mirroring internal "syntax." Sensory hierarchy (sounds dominant) reflects POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher translocation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via hum escalation to realization; cost legible in foreclosed dread path. Subtle internal pressure lacks one sharp agency-driven reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of chaos-to-purpose emerges organically via gear's reweighting from "anchor" to "complete thing"; final image offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in sound-focused noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from disorientation to "quiet certainty." No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, propulsion; varied rhythm peaks in "silent, roaring moment." No loops, coherent metaphors like "clockwork cosmos" enhance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-philosophy in mechanical wilds, with wind-syntax navigation transforming tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes to inevitable CR insight.</comment>
