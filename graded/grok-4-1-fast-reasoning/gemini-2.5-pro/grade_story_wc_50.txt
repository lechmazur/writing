<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Reflective locksmith's peripheral focus and private axiom drive consistent micro-choices like pin placement and charting, earning the rebuild; embodied patience shines in "days bled into weeks," but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations density-build to understanding; on-page closure via "nudged a small lever... echo bloomed," reconfiguring stasis to charged poise with felt cost of "arduous task" and season's weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marble cavern's "fissure... shaft of pale sunlight" and "curved surfaces" constrain method and charge final shimmer; selective sensory interplay of shadow/light mirrors internal focus without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake to rebuild timer escalates accumulatively from shattered gears to full sun-course chart tightening knowledge; agency in oblique glints forces trade-off of direct vs. peripheral, with cost legible in "days bled into weeks."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wonder stored in reason emerges organically via echo-harvest physics; final "fragments of stored wonder reawaken" offers resonant CR reweighting season's "monochrome silence" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature via "rarely looked straight... observing the space around it"; rhythmic prose modulates from quiet observation to resonant hum without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyricism propels via varied syntax; "ghost of the machine's operation" in glints integrates image/action, minor "quiet" recurrence thematic not looped.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith reverse-engineering echo-physics via light geometry transforms trope into inevitable "resonator tuned... by geometry"; risk in peripheral method heightens ingenuity.</comment>
