<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in weaving joy/des-pair palettes act simultaneously; final empathy ache earned by incision unifying them, with embodied chest pang as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds via ritual layers to CR closure in incised scratch; cost legible in "quiet, fragile ache" mirroring earth's wound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry mist and rock constrain makeshift table and palette mixing, charging final scratch that mirrors "wound in the earth"; sensory hierarchy reflects artist's structural focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to awaken empathy tightens via incision deepening absence into unity; agency in brush-lancing forecloses blank empathy with emotional cost in shuddering breath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of empathy via absence emerges organically from opposites' unification; final scratch reweights process non-literally, embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature fixates on shapes/dualities over faces; rhythmic control peaks in incision beat with compression matching clarity strike, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in ritual beats; zero loops, metaphors cohere (e.g., "forced marriage of contradictions") without muddling peak incision image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Face-blind artist's abstract portrait of absence transforms cold case trope; incision risk crystallizes ingenuity, feeling inevitable from methodical opposites.</comment>
