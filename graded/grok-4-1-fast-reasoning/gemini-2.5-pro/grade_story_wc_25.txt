<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silas's quiet competence and walk-identification drive motivated micro-choices like coin flip and cipher use; final no-gloat renunciation earns authority with relational cost to Kaelen, though contradictory impulses act more implicitly than simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via challenge→navigation→discovery→return; closure CR in "The walls listen" reconfigures power with Kaelen's arrogance cost legible in his stripped voice and slumped defeat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Labyrinth containers and geomagnetic storm constrain tactics (no compass, celestial nav); bruised aurora light charges final eyes-dance image, mirroring quiet victory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (timed manifest find to prove methods) signaled early; crossroads coin tightens via risk, cipher deepens agency, costing Kaelen's team grime/defeat on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Whispers-over-shouts theme emerges from actions/images; final line offers resonant CR repricing shouts' futility without moralizing, reweighting career premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable Silas POV with perceptual signature (walks, whispers); distinct dialogue rhythms sharpen status (Kaelen's bark vs. Silas's murmur), modulating under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm/syntax; "creases so deep they held shadows" integrates without muddle, no loops dulling labyrinth beats or closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Celestial map/coin cipher and walk-ID synthesize fresh competence proof; calculated-spontaneity tone transforms port challenge into inevitable whisper triumph.</comment>
