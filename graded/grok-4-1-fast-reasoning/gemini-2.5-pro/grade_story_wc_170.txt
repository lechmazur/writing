<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via borrowed heartbeat pulsing in ribs, compelling the ritual act with consistent calm traits; micro-choices like guiding light reveal values. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+ depth, but earns closure satisfaction without unmotivated leap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to performance, culminating in Charged Poise RR as final note dissolves and bells chime, reconfiguring light to "simple, wet sheen" with legible cost in heartbeat's recession. Orientation anchored early (painter on terrace pre-bells); single scene fits defaults flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism parapet post-rain constrains and enables core act, shattering light into rainbows for guiding; charges closure as sheen returns. Sensory details (slick stone, vibration) selective via POV, mirroring internal pulse without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mirage-painting ritual) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via inhalation, humming, hand-lift tightening to pulse-infused motes; agency in micro-conducting forecloses timing with bell-chime cost. One deepening sufficient under lens, visibly reweighting options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral possibilities emerges organically from mirror glimpses and seed-planting; final image ("ghost of a possibility, lingered behind the glass") offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting ritual without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (light as orchestra, city's sigh as heartbeat); rhythmic prose modulates to peak intensity in humming/lifting without slippage. Distinct texture fits lyric mode, elision purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (short hum sentences to expansive effects); no loops, purposeful metaphors (rainbows dancing on hands) enhance without muddling closure image. Strategic telling compresses city effects efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-magic via lullabies/heartbeat transforms trope into inevitable ritual; risk in poetic compression heightens ephemeral stakes, with painter's exit as bold, non-obvious poise.</comment>
