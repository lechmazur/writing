<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's grim optimism drives persistent logic against risk, embodied in "prodding a sleeping god with a compass and a ruler"; internal contradiction peaks in the white-knuckled roll, earning the triumphant reconfiguration with the felt cost of regret's ache.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: proofs build density to pattern break at nexus roll; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with cost in "fresh wound" amid reconfiguration of stairs as canvas, constraint of chipped die shaping tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Infinite staircase constrains choices via scratched proofs and nexus point, charging final image of stairs as "canvas"; sensory hierarchy (sterile air, stone dust) filters through Elian's mathematical bias without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing texture) signaled early, escalates via proof completion to rupture under textural lens; agency in calculated roll forces trade-off, with legible cost in ephemeral moment's ache narrowing to endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of logic piercing regret emerges organically via dice paradox; final image of chip as "key" and stairs as canvas offers resonant, non-literal reweighting of perfection's flaw without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in esoteric math diction ("web of symbols and integers"); rhythmic control modulates from painstaking buildup to resonant chime of roll, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful figures like "geometric tearing"; no loops or scaffolds, climax's "reality didn't break; it yielded" reads aloud with perfect propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of infinite stairs as math-dissectible prison transforms Escher trope via regret-texture quest; risk in paradox endeavor heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at dice-key reframe.</comment>
