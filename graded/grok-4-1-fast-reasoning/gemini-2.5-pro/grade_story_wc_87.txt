<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in simultaneous sea-longing and land-chaining, embodied in phantom spray and trembling hand; final step earns change via prior micro-choices like jaunty dirge. Minor therapy-speak in "core motivation" line slightly abstracts without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of regrets builds to Charged Poise closure in final step past pole, cost legible as "discarded crutch" shadow. Orientation anchored early via poles and kayak launch; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Compass as micro-setting constrains reflection and final offering, charging image; sensory details (salt/low tide, gravel thud) filter through navigational bias, guiding edge-step. Couple's kayak subtly pressures via contrast.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (align heart/action) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via memory waves and couple-pull to foreclose land-chaining; cost felt in boot-to-sand step narrowing escape options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of facing failure emerges via sea-vs-poles particulars, final compass-offering reweights "align" non-literally without moral; resonance from shifting pole-safety cage to horizon-pull.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature via navigational metaphors (celestial failure, keel broken); rhythm modulates from melancholic hum to deliberate step, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, high density integrates image/action; minor figurative density ("cartography of failure," "blazing sun to flickering candle") risks muddle in reflective peaks but pattern nautical and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poles as penance crutch vs sea-faith transforms redemption trope; utility-pole navigation and compass-offering feel inevitable, risking bold melancholic jaunt.</comment>
