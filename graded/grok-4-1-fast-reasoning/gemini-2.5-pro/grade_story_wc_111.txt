<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory belief in qualitative metrics over luck scores drives micro-choices like secret poultice and marble rituals; final cracking of perfect marble earns renunciation of seamlessness with visible cost, revealing values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as small victories (leaf, past rot) densify to butterfly climax and CR closure; deliberate crack on walkway reconfigures proof with conceptual cost of embracing imperfection on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden maze constrains competition (halves, bees ignore automata); sundial marble spot and final stone walkway charge rituals, mirroring Elias's resilient noticing of chaotic vibrancy over sterile uniformity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (prove wisdom > data) signaled early tightens via solstice tie to butterflies, forcing stance reconfiguration; cost legible in manager's dismissal edged by garden's unquantifiable choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Resilience-in-cracks theme emerges from vine/marbles/particulars, final cracked marble offering non-literal answer reweighting metrics without moral; ambiguity in "garden chose" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (e.g., "gnarled and weathered as ancient wisteria") biases toward living signs; rhythmic modulation peaks in meditative polish beats without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density in polish rituals advances character/atmosphere; varied syntax propels without loops or muddled figs, closure image crisp despite occasional rich metaphor density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Luck scores vs. garden wisdom premise fresh, marbles-as-monuments transforming resilience trope; final crack synthesizes organically, risking CR over tidy win.</comment>
