<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between scholarly logic and grandmother's superstition act simultaneously in the pivot from ink to tracing, earning the final shedding with embodied cost in the held breath and exposed skin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of failed inks and spreading crystal builds to pattern break in whispering names, yielding Charged Poise closure as dust dissolves with legible emotional cost in the sigh.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quill and arm as micro-settings constrain choices—ink beads off, tracing softens—charging the final blank-page image; sensory hush (moss-slicked stone, crisp air) mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (heal scars) deepens via agency shift from runic failure to folk naming under Accum lens, foreclosing scholarly path with cost in defiant crystal growth then thaw; quill pivot narrows options legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of heart-spoken runes emerges organically from ink rejection to naming whispers, resonant in final blank arm reweighting scholarly premise without statement; no moralizing, ambiguity in "new stories" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature filters crystals as "legible stories" and frost; lush rhythm modulates from held tension ("captured air burning") to releasing sigh, eliding nothing unearned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "fine, glittering dust lifted... danced" propels closure image; varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, figuratives cohere (crystals as "lock," "frost") without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rune logic vs. folk naming on stress-crystals transforms healing trope; floating platform and quill pivot feel inevitable, risking poetic interiority that heightens stakes organically.</comment>
