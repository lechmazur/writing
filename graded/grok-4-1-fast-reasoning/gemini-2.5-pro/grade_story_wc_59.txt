<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Obsessive hypothesizing and embodied quaking (thinner, sleepless) drive contradictory hope/fear impulses; final hands-ceasing earns stasis with hybrid cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to on-page crack/hatching/song CR; stalactite palace anchors orientation early, hybrid flaw legibly costs pure dream.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal aviary shards, clockwork incubator, and chasm gears constrain scavenging/vent power; song's reach to faltering pistons charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Beauty stake tightens via incubation risks (monster?) to hybrid birth; agency in resin/clicks forecloses purity with bittersweet resilience felt on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid song as "bitterly sweet anthem" reconfigures organic/mechanical premise non-literally; emerges from flawed assembly without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reverie diction (phosphorescence hypothesizing) biases perception consistently; rhythmic modulation peaks at crystalline beak chip without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates figuration (veins/gears) into action; varied syntax propels to "chimes and clicks" without loops or scaffold dulling hatch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Flawed Lumina-wing hybrid synthesizes steampunk tropes via hypothesizing genesis; quaking cessation risks lyric closure for fresh resilient dawn.</comment>
