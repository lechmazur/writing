<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation shines in the press climax where he experiences grief as "a complex, elegant equation unfolding," earning his detachment with visible cost to immersion; Anya's depth supports via reactions but lacks contradictory impulses. Contradictory borrowing reflex acts simultaneously with focus, passing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure: card's fractal symbol recontextualizes grief as shape, cost legible in Anya's "dizzying shock" and disorientation. One tightening via lever pull suffices; anchors clear early, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Topaz walls, press, and halo fragment constrain choices (e.g., light vortex during press) and charge final card image, passing 9+ test; sensory hierarchy cosmic/geometric reflects Elias's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Elias mapping emotion math via Anya's grief) signaled early, tightens via press deepening under Accumulative lens with density reweighting; cost unmistakable in "unbearable weight... recontextualized" at peak. Minor abstractness in stakes pre-press prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of emotion-as-geometry emerges organically, final card image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting grief's premise with conceptual cost, passing 9+ test; no moralizing, ambiguity in Elias's enigma lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elias's perceptual signature (geometric sorrow, theorems) holds under pressure; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Structure requires pressure"), rhythmic control distinct without head-hopping, passing 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated imagery (e.g., "metal slugs clicking like bones"); figurative language dense in climax but pattern-taught (cosmic turbulence) without muddle. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors risks ear fatigue but closure crisp, blocking 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress alchemy and emotion geometry transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in lucid turbulence heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight with conceptual integrity, passing 9+ test.</comment>
