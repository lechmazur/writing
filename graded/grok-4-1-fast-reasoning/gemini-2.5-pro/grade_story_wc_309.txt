<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (clumsy tools vs. instinctual mist walking and bare touch) act in scene, culminating in earned confidence via unstrapping; no unearned epiphanies or label-speak. Interiority particular (knot of inadequacy) and embodied (cold revelation hands). Final realization earned by prior failures with visible cost of shed pack/expectations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: failure density builds to pattern break (pack shed, bare touch), delivering on-page Conceptual Repricing closure where "sacred... way of seeing" reconfigures premise with felt cost of awakened resonance vs. prior despair. Orientation anchored early (spire, mist walking arrival). No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Spire's "brilliant dimness" and "skeletal... garden" constrain choices (tools absurdly complex vs. simple stone; cold numbs hands) and charge final image ("focus within him"). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (poet notices beauty folly over diagnostics). Purposeful selection mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quantify sacred simple magic) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via repeated tool failures narrowing to despair, then agency-driven deepening (unstrap/touch forecloses complex path with cost of exposed vulnerability). Cost legible in "quiet, unshakeable light" vs. prior inadequacy. One tightening sufficient and coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (sacred simple vs. automated complexity) emerges organically from tool failures to bare touch success; final image ("confidence to create... beautiful, for no reason") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars (keystone glow, pack thud) build complexity, no platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature ("bruised plum" sky, "brilliant dimness"); rhythmic control modulates frustration to revelation (short failure sentences to expansive close). Voice reflects poet-mage bias, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines integrate setting/action/emotion); varied rhythm propels (failure cracks/smoke to "gentle, pervasive warmth"). No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; specific verbs/nouns ("mist walking," "clasps") replace generics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of technomancy world (magic as "algorithm") transformed via underachiever's simple revelation; "mist walking" and keystone defy tropes organically. Risky quiet CR inevitable from established poet misalignment.</comment>
