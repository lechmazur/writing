<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's solemn archivist traits drive micro-choices like dismantling prior questions for a legacy-focused arrangement, revealing contradictory impulses (despair vs. isolation-born insight) that earn the closure shift; figure applies silent opposition without diluting single-POV interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual builds density to cadence shift via new debris statement ("laid the stone... draped the seaweed"), yielding CR closure ("suddenly resolved itself... a coordinate") with felt cost (trembling fingers after weeks trapped); two-shard structure transitions legibly via "surrendering to the pull."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon constrains parley (separates figures, provides debris/tools) and charges final return ("dark, still water" echoed in resolved script); selective sensory hierarchy (vibration to salt sting to lessened sunlight) reflects psychic urgency without white-room drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. defiance) deepens accumulatively when new arrangement forces figure's incline, narrowing options with legible cost ("burn of the reverie threatening to overwhelm"); agency in debris shift drives the sole tightening under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of legacy in conflict's ashes emerges organically via debris evolution (timeline/why to stone-urchin-seaweed), reweighting premise in CR ending without statement; lingering ambiguity (truth offered, not seized) resists tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature (archivist's precise cypher/noticing) biases details (diary "flaw in his mind"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in reverie parley, stable without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "dismantled his previous questions... sought out new materials" advances causality/character); varied syntax/rhythm passes ear test, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognitive parley via tactile debris transforms vision-quest trope; risk in silent, object-based negotiation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via ritual buildup.</comment>
