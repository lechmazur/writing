<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in frustration coiling then yielding to realization via seed; final choice to splint rather than seal earned by embodied shift ("physical blow") with relational cost. Flaw of clinging to past drives mistake of useless tools, balanced by genuine struggle. Voice particular through quartz-eye perceptions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory/reflective beats builds to CR closure ("beautiful scar") with conceptual cost of renouncing old vows legible in final image of ribbon left behind. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Elian on branch post-termination). One tightening via ribbon/seed discovery suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard-rafters setting constrains via heights and twisting roots, charging closure when Elian climbs down leaving ribbon; sensory hierarchy (quartz hum, apple scent) reflects mender's bias. Details evolve causally (sickly hum softens). Micro-object (Heartwood) mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend Heartwood to bridge wisdom) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via tool failure to seed-splint agency, foreclosing forceful mending with felt opportunity cost. Pressure coheres under lens; one deepening (realization as germination) narrows options. Cost unmistakable in loose binding vs. seal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of growth-through-fracture emerges organically from seed in fissure, reweighting "deciduous vows" via final image without statement. Resonance from particulars (ribbon as prayer) invites ambiguity on letting go. Protagonist arc inextricable; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature (quartz-eye visions of fractures/lights); rhythm modulates from discordant hum to vital thrum. Prose texture distinct in syntax echoing crystalline precision. No elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "wave of accidental wisdom washed over him, swift and stunning"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Zero figurative muddle in peak ("glowing, open mouth"); clean grammar, specific diction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy mending with literalized growth metaphor (seed in crystal) feels inevitable from quartz-eye/ribbon particulars. Risky orchard-cathedral premise transformed via character stakes; no derivative echoes.</comment>
