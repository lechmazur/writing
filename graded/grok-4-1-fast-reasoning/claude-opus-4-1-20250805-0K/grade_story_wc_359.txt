<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic interiority is concrete and particular, with contradictory sensory streams (e.g., "turquoise sound that she could taste as cinnamon") compelling the striker's descent and strike under deadline pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds sensory density to Charged Poise closure in aurora's descent and hush's unfettering, with legible cost in the cracking silence; single scene holds without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice cavern's "natural amphitheater" and formations constrain the precise strike while charging the final emergence; synesthetic filter selects purposeful details like "frozen note" bubbles.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save wonder via sheet before audit) tightens via realization it's for aurora and strike's resonance, escalating density to world reconfiguration with hush fracture as cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emergent theme of wonder's essentiality reweights via amber's dissolution into aurora, offering non-literal resonance without moralizing; particulars like oscillating repose avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("waves of turquoise sound") biases noticing consistently, with rhythmic modulation under climax pressure; stable single POV, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied sensory syntax, though minor figurative stacking in aurora cascade risks blur; no loops, clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic ice-aurora symphony transforms bell-ringer trope into fresh, inevitable premise; bold lyric risks heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
