<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: backstory shards build density to Elena's return and single note as CR, reweighting silence with conceptual cost of transmuted voices; orientation anchored in first paragraph, closure image of warming stones undeniable.</comment>
