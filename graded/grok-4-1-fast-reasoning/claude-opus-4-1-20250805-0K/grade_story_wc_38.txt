<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's inherited lyrical skill compels precise dance choices under lab pressure; micro-decisions reveal contradiction between logical doubt and bodily knowing. Final realization of destiny as "old coat" earns change with embodied cost. Minor epiphanic summary at close prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds from dance splashes to pulsing lights and screen spiral; unweaving reversal tightens to CR closure in "Welcome home, granddaughter" with inheritance cost legible in final spiral. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brackish water and green shafts constrain footwork and mirror internal patterns, charging closure spiral; tactile splashes and dice balance integrate via dancer's bias. Recurrent lab evolution with action avoids stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dance stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via system responses and reversal, forcing endurance with destiny burden as felt cost in "weight of destiny settled." Protagonist agency shapes all escalation; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Journal quote "encrypt vulnerability as strength" emerges via dance liberation, answered non-literally in grandmother's message and spiral holding shape—reweights inheritance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical syntax and choreographic perception signature modulate with intensity; stable close-third POV biases toward patterns in water/light. No head-hopping; rhythm peaks in reversal beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density weaves action/image without loops; varied rhythms propel from splashes to glow, though occasional rich metaphor risks minor overwrite in reversal. Closure image clear, no artifacts dulling poise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dance-as-decryption transforms cipher trope via inherited motion and impossible dice geometry; unweaving turn and spiral payoff feel inevitable from early choreography.</comment>
