<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's tremble as plan crystallizes embodies contradictory impulses of cruelty/kindness, earning her anonymous resolution with felt cost in sly anonymity. Interiority concrete via chain handling and resin insight. Micro-choices like carving stones reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of insights (resin to floodgates) builds to Charged Poise closure in carved plans/note, reconfiguring conflict with conceptual cost of interdependence. Orientation anchored early in amphitheater/town stakes. Single scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amphitheater's breathing constrains carving choices and charges final exhale image. Sensory details (thermal rhythm, stone groan) mirror internal flow via POV bias. Micro-setting (chain as tool) evolves tactilely across beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (town harmony) signaled early, tightens via tremble/plan crystallization under textural lens, narrowing to interdependent design with legible cost in forced collaboration. Agency in resin analysis to turbine/canal weave forecloses solo victories.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Encrypted compassion emerges implicitly from resin binding to mixed-resin note, final water-flow image resonantly reweighting conflict without moral. Theme from particulars avoids platitudes, protagonist arc inextricable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (measuring hearts, flow metaphors) modulates rhythm under insight pressure. Stable close-third POV, purposeful compression taught early via breathing motif pays off cleanly. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., chain unwinding advances plot/character/backstory); rhythmic variety supports lyric propulsion. Minor figurative density in plan beat fits pattern, no loops or muddle touching closure. Opening/final lines recharge motifs precisely.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of machinist mediation via resin/fluid dynamics transforms water-rights trope; volcano patience/chain legacy risks lyric boldness, heightening stakes inevitably to interdependent closure.</comment>
