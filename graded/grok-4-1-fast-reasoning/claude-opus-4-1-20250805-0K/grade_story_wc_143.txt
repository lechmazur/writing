<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in curiosity, shown via descent and vigil despite evacuation; embodied irony in "boots left prints that would last millennia" reveals contradiction without summary dominance. Final endurance earned by prior choices. Minor reflective abstraction slightly dilutes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to vapor climax then CR closure in hourglass placement and rocket horizon, reweighting retreat with conceptual cost legible in "Moon would wait, patient as always." Orientation anchored early; one tightening suffices. No lens ambiguity or debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Regolith, earthlight, vapor constrain vigil timing and descent choices; hourglass charges final image as "returned to its cosmic neighbor." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (scientific-poetic). Micro-setting (fissure, timer) mirrors internal transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (photograph last vapor) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via chemical timer and diminishing ice; agency in preparation forecloses evacuation delay with felt cost in leaving prints/proof. Escalation coherent under lens, one deepening at emergence sufficient. Minor abstractness in broader stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of costly curiosity emerges implicitly via particulars (vapor ghost, hourglass return), final image reconfigures abandonment without moralizing—"between what we'd dreamed and what we'd settled for." Resonance from irony, no tidy resolution. Protagonist arc inextricable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature (lunar-scientific lyricism); rhythm modulates from hush to dawnlit peak. Diction controlled, syntax reflects isolation's poise. No head-hopping or withholding; elision minimal and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel via image integration; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull closure. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("Earth hung pregnant," "ghost's breath") but pattern-taught and legible under textural lens. Propulsion matches scene cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh alt-1979 lunar vigil synthesizes space race retreat with ice discovery and chemical timer ingenuity; hourglass reprise transforms trope organically. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight via purposeful curiosity.</comment>
