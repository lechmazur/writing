<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's diligently curious nature drives consistent micro-choices like tracing hopscotch patterns and cross-referencing the book, embodied in her whispers and smiles; final endurance of isolation feels earned via accumulative observations without tidy epiphany. Minor lack of contradictory impulses under peak realization slightly tempers perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern density building to CR closure in the book's final sketch ("How to find your way home"), reweighting discovery as rediscovery with conceptual cost of humanity's lost map; orientation anchored early in navigation chamber, no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hopscotch board as micro-setting constrains choices (cipher decoding) and charges final image; starlings and airship details filter through Elara's pattern bias, tactile (dusty fingers, creaking timbers) and purposeful without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of charting luminance tightens via breakthrough ("They're writing") under accumulative lens, narrowing to follow ancient routes; cost legible in ongoing isolation, but no sharp agency reversal beyond attention shifts options mildly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rediscovery emerges from particulars like hopscotch cipher and birds' light-writing, resonant CR in final beacon pulse reweighting "next great discovery" without moralizing; ambiguity of "sociable isolation" lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited voice with perceptual signature (patterns in rust, tea leaves) modulates rhythmically; compression of days into textural density taught early, stable without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm supports accumulative propulsion; minor overwriting in "whispered conversations of wind" skirts purple but integrates; no loops, clear syntax propels to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of birds as 3D cartographers via hopscotch/light transforms migration trope; risk of lyric accumulative structure heightens rediscovery stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
