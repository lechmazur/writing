<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Precognitive flashes create contradictory impulses acting in scene, earning final endurance as herder with ongoing cost; grandmother's promise roots motivation without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as stone placement density triggers dust, eels, and vision tightening to CR closure; "three million years backward" image makes conceptual cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Aurora "ribbons descending like curious fingers" and tidal bluff constrain pattern ritual while charging eel emergence and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to complete promise deepens via eel vision forcing knowledge shift under accumulative lens; perpetual tending cost unmistakable in new stone placement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eel contact reconfigures frictionless world as restoration through lived pattern sequence, offering non-literal answer with Yann's inherited burden as conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature of fluid motion ("writhed...serpents," "spirals") stable in single POV, rhythmic control heightens precog tension without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds, high density propels from stone grooves "pulsing" to aurora pulse; varied rhythm peaks in vision without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frictionless physics synthesized with fibonacci eels and star dust into inevitable CR; risky conceptual premise transformed without retreat.</comment>
