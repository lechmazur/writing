<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority peaks concretely in "felt something leaving her own chest—a warmth, a possibility," embodying contradictory impulses; final renunciation earned by accumulated search, foreclosing her own longing with visible emotional cost. Grandmother's backstory anchors via palette handoff without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as light-painting fragments densify into whole figure, culminating in Charged Poise closure when "Mara set down the palette"—cost legible in dissolving figure and her heart's openness preserved. Orientation anchored early; single-shard scene tightens meaningfully at seventh-year island without micro turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Palette-as-micro-setting constrains vitalization precisely, charging final image as figure dissolves "back into the morning light." Sensory hierarchy (molten copper water, whispering clarity) reflects Mara's biased noticing, evolving causally with dawn; whispers guide island choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vitalize grandmother's love vs. own capacity) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as "image grew more solid" forces trade-off; agency in palette drop crystallizes stance with felt opportunity cost under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of longing's beauty in incompleteness emerges organically via light fragments and final "luminous absence"; resonant non-literal answer in dissolving smile reweights prior islands' whispers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV, perceptual signature biased to refracted light ("impossible colors"); rhythmic modulation builds to hush at "precisely the right moment," no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated images ("glass pieces began their work, bending light"); no loops, coherent metaphors, varied rhythm peaks in climax without overwriting—closure image crisp and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prism-vitalization transforms lost-love trope into light-encoded cipher; risk of lyric dawn constraint heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via palette's early anchor.</comment>
