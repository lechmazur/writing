<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prosopagnosia drives concrete micro-choices like tracing grooves and texture-mapping, earning the final realization of fractured humanity; contradictory impulses act in portraits revealing duality without alternating summaries. Interiority particular, embodied in black fingers and trembling hand. Blind spots compound productively before closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: portrait density tightens from individual contradictions to killer's unified absorption, landing CR closure in the circle of portraits with conceptual cost of recognizing shattered minds. Orientation anchored early in quarry/murders. Pattern emergence by eleventh portrait suffices as one decisive deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist, limestone grooves, and charcoal gradients constrain positioning and perception, charging final image as mist lifts to reveal corners mirroring realization. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (texture over sight). Quarry evolves causally from pressing silence to cupped truth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstruct truth sans masks) signaled early, escalates via pattern-deepening that narrows to killer's identity; agency in methodical strokes forecloses misreadings with cost in trembled hand and phone call. Density reweights under lens. One tightening coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unifying fractures emerges organically from portraits' dualities to final composite, offering non-literal resonant answer in "seventeen proofs that we are all divided selves." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in killer-victim mirror. Protagonist arc inextricable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in texture/shadow over faces; rhythmic prose modulates from measured strokes to silence's poise. Diction controlled, biased noticing (silk weave secrets). No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies with scene (whisper to drip to breeze). Metaphors purposeful ("light through prisms") without muddle. Propulsion clear to final cupped hands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Face-blind portraitist synthesizing victims' contradictions transforms crime procedural into psychological inquiry; risk in abstract-yet-concrete closure heightens stakes. Premise fresh, inevitable in hindsight via ribbon/portraits.</comment>
