<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies via arrow tip's warmth compelling higher-stakes navigation; interiority concrete through embodied sensations like "fingers traced the broken arrow tip... warm, almost alive." Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for deeper conflict, but micro-choices under Inversion reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from water navigation to echoes crescendoing at monument; CR closure via pressing arrow tip ("Light erupted... knowledge flooded") reweights premise with conceptual cost of prior colony failures legible in final understanding. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph; one tightening at spherical grove suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating arches and upward water constrain choices like threading narrow gap; recurring "whirling silence" and warmth charge final image. Sensory hierarchy pilot-specific (reading currents "like ancient sailors"); no white-room, all integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resilience source) signaled early tightens via Inversion forcing anchored approach to monument, narrowing options under Accumulative lens; agency in path choice and tip insertion forecloses adaptation path with felt colony cost. Minor abstractness in stakes until monument, but pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of resilience as ignoring change emerges organically via trees' defiance and final "dancing with it" realization reweighting water/echoes motifs without overt moralizing. Closing image of guiding skiff home resonates non-literally; earned from particulars, avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in pilot-biased noticing (currents as "water's wisdom," echoes as "ghost of sound"); rhythmic prose modulates from quiet navigation to Inversion crescendo without filter excess. Voice distinct and controlled under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with lines doubling action/atmosphere (e.g., "whirling silence pressed... her breathing created tiny vortexes"); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in opening sensory cluster but purposeful and non-obscuring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity-flip planet, arrow-tech seeds teaching custom gravity transforms tropes organically; risk in upward rivers/echoes as navigational stakes heightens ingenuity without gimmickry, inevitable at monument payoff.</comment>
