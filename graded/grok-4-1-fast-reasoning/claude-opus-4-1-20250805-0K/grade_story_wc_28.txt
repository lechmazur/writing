<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (guilt vs. compulsion to restore) act simultaneously in visions, earning the final reframe of curse as invitation with visible emotional cost in weeping and acceptance. Old man applies relevant pressure without diluting Sarai's arc. Interiority concrete via embodied visions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: tessera placement triggers visions that densify realization, culminating in CR closure ("Her retrocognitive curse wasn’t punishment—it was invitation") with conceptual cost of foreclosing restoration for transformation. Orientation anchored immediately in plaza/tessera. Single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stepping stones as micro-setting constrain choices (fitting tesserae triggers visions) and charge closure image (patterns realign to name "Sarai"). Sensory details (frost, warm stone, smoke in visions) selective via POV urgency. Shattered sky evolves to promise in final line.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compelled restoration amid curse/Brotherhood threat) signaled early; accumulative deepening via visions narrows options, forcing stance crystallization in "creating space for what comes next" with felt cost of necessary pain ("embracing hot iron"). Agency in persistence tests commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy emerges organically from visions/mercy backstory, reweighted in mosaic naming and future garden image without statement. Final possibility vision offers non-literal answer to restoration question, embracing complexity via transformed fragments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (visions as temporal splits filtered through mercy lens). Voice rhythmic/poetic yet controlled, modulating with intensity; dialogue subtextual ("The stones remember") advances stakes. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (short vision bursts contrast longer realizations). Minor figurative density in opening ("world split open—temporally") purposeful, not obscuring peaks. No loops; clean syntax supports accumulative build to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of retrocognition curse-to-gift inversion via mosaic metaphor, with risky poetic tone heightening transformation stakes. Core premise transformed through specifics like ninety-nine names realigning; no derivative echoes.</comment>
