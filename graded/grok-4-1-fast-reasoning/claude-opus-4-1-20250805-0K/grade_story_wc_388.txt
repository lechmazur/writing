<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's arc from debunker to nuanced preserver is earned through concrete micro-choices like reassembling letters and scattering them, with contradictory impulses (expose vs. shelter) peaking in the digging decision. Interiority particularized via career history tilting under pressure. Final renunciation forecloses exposure path with felt cost of returning to wasteland.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Geiger clicks → box discovery → letter reassembly → diamond exhumation → multi-hole burial as DC with cost (truth seeded but diamond preserved). Orientation anchored early (orchard, six years post-liquidation). Closure charged by storm's approach reconfiguring stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specifics (glowing fruit, howling wind, dust storms) constrain choices, with orchard center's ancient tree and diamond as micro-settings charging final image. POV-filtered (debunker's eyes) details evolve causally. Diamond flaw mirrors theme without overtness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debunk orchard miracle) tightens via letters' revelation narrowing to expose-vs-preserve binary, driven by agency in digging/re-burying. Cost legible in departing amid storm, foreclosing full exposure. Causal escalation peaks cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of flawed truths preserving wholes emerges via diamond's imperfection and letter-seeding, reweighting premise in final image without statement. Resonance from particulars (apple trees untouched) offers non-literal answer to conspiracy's real cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (skeptic scanning dust, intuiting stillness). Rhythmic control modulates from investigative to reflective, diction biased toward rational observation yielding to nuance. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propelling beats; no loops, artifacts, or muddled figs in peak (diamond hold, storm approach). Propulsion peaks in concise closure actions. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: debunker vindicates conspiracy only to seed partial truth, transforming trope via diamond's literal stillpoint. Risky stasis ending heightens nuance. Non-obvious moral calculus on knowledge's value feels inevitable.</comment>
