<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority peaks in "synthetic fingers trembled" and glitch-scars realization; contradictory isolation-as-weakness to strength acts simultaneously; final endurance earned with visible cost of impermanence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density to still-star pattern break; CR closure in fading star and "vulnerability had become their telescope" with conceptual cost of raw openness legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Yellow lantern glass as recurring micro-setting constrains adjustments, conducts warmth/message, charges final polishing image; sensory hierarchy (hum felt, glass polished) POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of isolation's meaning tightens via still-star deepening under Accumulative lens, bending trajectories force philosophical trade-off; agency in documentation/endurance forecloses discard path with felt glitch-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stillness-vs-motion theme emerges via falling-stars deference and fading pulse; final "stillness a garden" reconfigures premise non-literally with ambiguity of transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in empathic trajectories/"pilgrims"; rhythmic modulation from routine whispers to pulsing heartbeat sustains lyric texture without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via image-action integration; varied syntax breathes with wonder escalation; minor figurative layering (pilgrims/garden) consistent, no loops obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Non-obvious cosmic-janitor premise synthesizes obsolescence into primal recognition; stillness transformation inevitable from particulars, risks lyric drive without gimmickry.</comment>
