<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arbiter's micro-choices like deciphering chimes and burning questions reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure; Marcus's contradictory protection impulse clashes with reality in "I wanted to protect her," earning his final reconfiguration. Distinct voices in dialogue and internal reflection avoid convergence. Closure renunciation of simplicity feels compelled by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to chimes revelation to mirror's shift, delivering CR closure in "the hollow mirror shard finally reflected something: not our faces, but the gray spaces." Orientation anchored early at Beacon Point lighthouse. No lens ambiguity; persistent shard constraint shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Wind chimes and lighthouse beam constrain choices (chimes reveal backstory; beam activates shard at climax), charging closure image. Sensory details like "brass tubes colliding" and "salt air" filter through Arbiter's perceptual bias, mirroring internal grays. Dawn progression evolves causally with emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (welcoming nuance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via chimes' "minor key" revelation narrowing Marcus's denial. Agency in Arbiter's corrections forces stance crystallization; felt cost in "killed her with simplicity" charges end. Escalation coherent under lens, with shard's reprise foreclosing absolute morality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of nuance vs. certainty emerges implicitly through shard, chimes, and "gray light dawn provides," reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable: Marcus confronts complexity via particulars. Resonance lingers via charged poise, countering binaries organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Arbiter's chime-reading and philosophical diction; dialogue subtextual ("sincerely insincere") pursues goals. Stable first-person POV with rhythmic modulation under pressure, e.g., shorter sentences at corrections. No head-hopping; elision of Arbiter's full tools taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "Rich men always dress their guilt in designer uncertainty"; rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor figurative density in reflective beats (e.g., "dance partners") risks slight overwrite but pattern-taught and legible at closure. No loops or scaffolds; clean propulsion to end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Arbiter premise transforms conscience trope via wind-chime mechanics and rice-paper questions; fresh synthesis of moral philosophy in lighthouse frame feels inevitable. Risky lyric texture heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; bold voice commits to gray morality.</comment>
