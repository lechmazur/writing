<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's embodied emotions (chest ache at pure happiness) and micro-choices (whispering to fragment, coaxing memories) reveal contradictory impulses under fog's weight, earning her shift to lightness with visible cost in impermanence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from personal light-painting to collective network, delivering Charged Poise closure in "It wouldn't last—dreams never did," reweighting joy's stake with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresco fragment as micro-setting constrains choices (pulses warm, coaxes visions) and charges final image (glows faintly in hands), with sensory details like tasting apple seeds mirroring internal fog-to-joy shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover joy vs. fog) deepens accumulatively via network sharing, narrowing to collective impermanence cost, but lacks a single option-foreclosing turn sharp enough for 9-band under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral joy-through-remembering emerges implicitly from light-woven murals; final image of drifting amid blooming blossoms offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with artist's perceptual signature (photons from memory, pigments through decay) and rhythmic modulation (short bursts in painting beats) sustain texture under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (film developing in reverse) propels without loops or muddle; rhythm varies naturally, peaking in "cave walls now blazed with reconstructed glory."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-painting and artist network transforms fog-ruined world into pensive joy engine; risk in lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
