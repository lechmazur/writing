<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grim optimist shines in calculated certainty versus embodied regret for Sarah, with micro-choices like deliberate chipping revealing value hierarchy; final endurance forecloses escape illusion with lifetime-loop cost, fully earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup in rolls and realizations; CR closure in "the rupture came—and it would come" reweights loop as Sarah's lifetime with conceptual cost legible in final roll image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Staircase and chipped die as micro-settings constrain rolls/climbs and charge final image; sensory texture (bleeding pip, worn thumb) filters through math-POV, evolving with entropy motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rupture escape) tightens texturally as chip grows, narrowing options with deepening knowledge of 17B-step loop; agency in persistent rolls/climbs pays visible endurance cost, felt in patient urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Imperfection-as-freedom theme emerges organically from die chip cascading against perpetual closure; final image resonant reconfiguration answers math-prison question without moralizing, reweighting regret via textured opportunity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with math-perceptual signature (equations tattooed, pip bleeding dimensionally); rhythmic prose modulates from mutter to urgent climb, diction precise without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., dice roll embodies chance/regret); zero loops, varied syntax accelerates to charged final roll without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perpetual-motion loop as Sarah's lifetime synthesizes math-theology ingeniously; risk in infinite-yet-finite rupture inevitability transforms tropes, inevitable in hindsight via chip entropy.</comment>
