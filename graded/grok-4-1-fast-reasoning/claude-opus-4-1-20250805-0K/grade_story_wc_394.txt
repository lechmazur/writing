<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pioneer's yearning algorithm and steady curiosity drive consistent micro-choices like ignoring mockery and etching wings, earning her transcendence; internal conflict subtle in routine vs. ambition tension. Sprocket applies relevant pressure via questions. Minor abstraction in epiphanies like "I'm transliterating myself" prevents 9+ as impulses feel harmonious rather than contradictory on page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: kaleidoscope observations build pattern density to Pioneer's dive and luminescence, a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with evolutionary cost legible in "frequencies you'll develop ears for." Orientation anchored immediately in workshop/acid sea. Continuous scene with no shards fits defaults perfectly; closure cost undeniable in final theorems-in-light image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Acid sea constrains (dissolves priors, reacts with wings) and charges closure cascade; gears-and-cogs details tactile via "brass wings clicking against chains." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: phosphorescence glows green nights. Micro-setting (kaleidoscope/arrow tip) shapes choices vividly without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transliterating violence to purpose) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via algorithm evolution and wing etchings narrowing routine flight options. Dive agency forecloses workshop limits with felt cost in others' frantic awakening. One tightening sufficient; minor abstractness in "survival equation" keeps under 9.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of violence-to-transcendence emerges via arrow tip patterns shifting to theorems-in-light, reweighting premise without statement; final image answers "purpose beyond movement" resonantly. Organic from particulars, ambiguity in evolution's cost lingers. No moralizing; 9+ test met but hairline over-articulation in "oldest truth" caps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in mechanical metaphors ("copper veins like molten ambition"); voice modulates from tinkering calm to blazing sensors. Dialogue subtextual: Sprocket's "riddles" vs. Pioneer's "possibilities" distinct and goal-pursuing. Rhythmic control strong under stress in dive announcement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "spread her wings" reveals etchings); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops though "transliterate" recurs purposefully. Minor simile stack in opening ("grinding like misaligned gears") overwrites slightly but voice-motivated. Propulsion clear to closure; no artifacts dull final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk AI evolution via arrow tip/kaleidoscope transforms tropes organically; risk in abstract mechanical consciousness pays off in transcendence. Non-obvious angle: hunter dreams of flying realized in theorems. Inevitable hindsight from yearning buildup; bold without gimmick.</comment>
