<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synesthetic embodiment particularizes Cornelius's motivation and emotions throughout; internal drive to reunite with Isabella earns her materialization without contradiction, though her brief appearance limits relational crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as echo density builds fractured timelines to Isabella's on-page materialization (RR/Charged Poise); cost legible in eternal binding to garden via final performance image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mystic orchard's fractured trees and maze paths constrain temporal navigation and charge closure with blooming reconciliation; synesthetic sensory filter (e.g., "cardamom and spiraling gold") mirrors stakes purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lure Isabella from despair) signaled early, escalates via protagonist-agency echoes intertwining timelines; one decisive deepening at her solidification forecloses isolation with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love redeeming fractured time emerges organically from echoed performances; final intertwined dance reweights despair's "purple edge" into nostalgic eternity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("honey and copper," "strawberries and silver") distinct and stable in third-limited POV; Isabella's whisper carries natural subtext tying to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful synesthetic metaphors propels accumulative rhythm; minor figurative density in echo descriptions (e.g., "fishing lines cast into temporal streams") risks overload but remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic ghost conducting timelines via echoes transforms ghost-reunion trope into fresh, inevitable synthesis; risk-taking in temporal braiding heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
