<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maya's embodied tension via parachute buckle habit and muscle memory micro-choices reveal internal conflict; allegiance shift from watcher to guardian earned through withheld truths and lie about timeline, with visible risk cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via pattern observations to intruder call tightening stakes; Charged Poise closure reconfigures purpose with conceptual cost legible in "burden had become her purpose" final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor's bioluminescent details and "silence that wasn't absence but presence" constrain climbs and signal forest listening, charging final vigil image; body/altitude pressures choices throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forest preservation vs. harvest) signaled early, deepens accumulatively with intruder forcing truth/lie trade-off; cost in self-exposure and lie narrows options, felt in transmission urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of adaptation's burden emerges via withheld reports and final witness realization; resonant non-literal answer in sky-whispered secrets reweights corporate premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person perceptual signature biases toward patterns/silence; dialogue subtextual with goal pursuit (trust test), natural rhythm distinguishing tense voice from Maya's poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/action; varied rhythm propels to closure without loops, though minor figurative density in opening slightly overwrites but serves accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sky-forests as carbon sinks with aerial roots transform eco-trope via inventive specifics; final reconfiguration from maintenance to guardianship feels inevitable from pattern-seeking premise.</comment>
