<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied in patient untangling ("violence would destroy the very connections"), revealing contradictory impulses of care vs. haste; final renunciation of clock ritual earned by decoding's causal buildup with visible cost in paused time. Flawless single-POV coherence avoids stereotypes, traits shown through worldview of grief-as-gardening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from case to threads' stories, culminating in CR closure ("shape of intentions... circular, seasonal") with undeniable conceptual cost in ritual pause ("rewound the chess clock but didn't start it"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene seamless, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Silo, stars, and roses constrain choices (silo for private study, shears as tool) and charge final image ("cobalt silo stood sentinel"); sensory hierarchy gardener-specific (roots, threads like script), vivid yet economical, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode tapestry's memory) signaled early, escalates texturally via thread density increasing knowledge/weight; one tightening in emergence of "letters: not words exactly, but intentions" narrows to personal reweighting, agency in patient decoding, cost legible in foreclosed ritual time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-devotion emerges organically from thread particulars ("mother who planted rosemary") to resonant CR ("every grave... teaching her the same lesson"); final image reconfigures prior material without moralizing, ambiguity in "border between life and death" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature garden-inflected ("root systems," "seasonal"); rhythmic control modulates from humming calm to realization's poise, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("wind rattled... like distant applause" integrates sensory/atmosphere/action); zero loops/artifacts, varied syntax accelerates decoding beat, figurative language purposeful without muddle in peak realization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reliquary-tapestry as grief-map in gardener's world transforms cemetery trope; risk-taking in textural decoding/ritual breakage heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from early case setup to CR.</comment>
