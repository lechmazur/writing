<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's interiority shines in the mirror glimpse of her "younger, angrier" self, earning her transformation to gardener with embodied cost in lighter shadows; keeper applies pressure via purposeful dialogue. Minor flaw: keeper's traits shown but not deeply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of glimpses tightening to CR closure in apple bite and departing realization ("warmth generates from understanding"), cost felt in mission shift; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Impossible orchard constrains via warmth vs. grinding ice, charging final image of shadows as "bridges"; mirrors filter through POV bias, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anomaly investigation) deepens accumulatively via resonant glimpses narrowing Mira's self-view, forcing stance crystallization; cost legible in forfeited "enforcer" path during apple acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of empathy-as-warmth emerges organically from merchant's reconstitution and Mira's arc, final image resonantly reweighting premise without moralizing; earned via particulars like apple's "forgiveness" taste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (shadows as "bridges") stable in single POV; dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, keeper's "patience of trees" distinct from Mira's intuition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety, but overwriting in metaphors like "shadow-laced peacekeeper" clusters slightly dull peak realization; no loops, propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empathic mirrors in impossible orchard transforms anomaly trope; risk in lyrical CR closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
