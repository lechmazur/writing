<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chen's interiority shines in contradictory impulses—transposing others' lives while composing his own disappearance—earned through prior causality, culminating in the final step with visible cost of self-orchestration. Traits shown via micro-choices like arranging slips as sheet music reveal worldview without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant) holds: fortunes accumulate patterns that reweight his role, CR closure in "Chen stepped through" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of universal authorship, on-page via scattered slips and specs on rocks. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lighthouse beam as recurring micro-setting constrains rhythm of composition and charges final image, mirroring internal state through "three seconds, darkness, three seconds, light." Sensory selection (salt-stained windows, scarred wood) reflects POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-transcendence) signaled early via fortunes; Accumulative deepening via beam's "TRANSCEND" narrows to renunciation, agency in leaving slips forces trade-off with felt cost in disappearance image. One tightening sufficient, charges closure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of self-authored fate emerges from particulars like fortune mix-ups and blank musical slips, resonant CR in final realization reweights open secrets without moralizing. No tidy binary; ambiguity lingers in "everyone... writing their own fortune."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in musical metaphors (fortunes as "sheet music," lives transposed); rhythmic control modulates from observation to charged poise at door. Brief bartender dialogue natural, subtext-laden.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-task (e.g., beam sweep advances rhythm/causality/atmosphere); varied rhythm echoes beam without template cadence. Zero loops; propulsion peaks clean in final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-telling as spycraft symphony transforms Cold War tropes via microdot-musical notation; risk in CR disappearance inevitable from patterned particulars, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
