<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation intensifies convincingly from journal discovery to testimony, with hovering as embodied trait enabling micro-choices; reclamation of "True-Tongue" at climax feels earned by inherited curse. Minor slip: contradictory impulses told via backstory rather than simultaneous in-scene tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density (copper light, lattice shadows) builds revelations to CR closure: lattice glows, accepting testimony with cost of decades' isolation legible in "every scuff... spells out the real story." Orientation anchored early in cell setup; one tightening via palm-press visions suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lattice constrains entry and charges final image as truth-map; reef prison, ajar door guide hovering path with tactile specificity. Sensory hierarchy (copper light pulses, salt air) mirrors internal hush-chase without catalog; micro-setting (lattice, bones) evolves causally to payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose truth before boat) signaled early, tightens via visions reweighting knowledge under Accumulative lens; agency in hovering/speaking forecloses liar legacy with felt cost in impending discovery. Minor: no live trade-off shown mid-beat, but closure crystallizes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth-in-hush emerges organically from lattice visions and "threaded labyrinth," reweighting wolf fable without statement; final image offers non-literal resonance via prison holding truth. Protagonist arc inextricable from conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in hovering/idiosyncratic notices (scuffs, copper light); rhythmic prose modulates to charged poise at "Marcus smiled, floating." No dialogue; purposeful compression legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (short confession beats into expansive close); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures in peak lattice moment. Opening anchors stakes; final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms wolf fable via hovering curse, lattice-truth map, ritual scapegoat; risk in fantastical CR heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious premise follows implications to inevitable close without retreat.</comment>
