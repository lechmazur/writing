<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margot's motivation to reinvent roots in concrete pigeon backstory and intensifies through contradictory impulses to destroy then preserve letters, earning her final acceptance of integrated selves. Interiority particular via dust-mapping as pigeon-training analogue. Flaw of suspicion yields to trust in seasonal micro-choices, with visible cost in confronting preserved past via envelope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dust patterns, letter discoveries, seasonal shifts builds to Conceptual Repricing closure where envelope reconfigures self-understanding with emotional cost of accepting unburned past. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (attic, Margot's disgrace). One tightening via Theodore's revelation pays off without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Skylight dust motes recur as micro-setting constraining Margot's meditative choices and charging final music-mapping image. Sensory details (rust-red meteorite, water stains) filter through her archivist bias, evolving with healing. Vintage attic tactile and lived-in, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reinventing post-disgrace) signaled early, tightens via seasonal deepening and Theodore's revelation narrowing suspicion to trust. Agency in preservation choices forecloses escape path with felt cost of vulnerability. Accumulative pressure coheres to cadence shift; cost unmistakable in envelope's exposure of undestroyed history.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truths in omissions emerges organically from letter-sorting, dust patterns, pigeon parallels, reweighted by meteorite/envelope reprise without statement. Final image answers reinvention question non-literally via music-as-pigeon return. Complexity lingers in moral ambiguity of her "accident."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited POV stable, perceptual signature via trajectory-mapping idiom biases noticing. Voice texture rhythmic and character-specific, modulating from brittle to blooming. Theodore's dialogue sparse, natural, subtext-rich ("I knew your pigeons"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "dust motes spiraled like constellations" advances setting, theme, character). Rhythms vary for propulsion, metaphors consistent/coherent (pigeons/dust/music). No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; final line recharges motifs crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pigeon trainer archiving lovesongs via dust meteorite talisman transforms reinvention trope. Risky lyric-reflective structure heightens emotional stakes organically. Non-obvious turn: preserved envelope from her past reframes destruction attempts.</comment>
