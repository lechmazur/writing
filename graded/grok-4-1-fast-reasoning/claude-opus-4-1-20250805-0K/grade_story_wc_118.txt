<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Thrain's sensitively perceptive gift drives concrete micro-choices like probing scorched edges and pressing tapestry to diary, earning the closure realization of her tending role with isolation's conceptual cost; contradictory awareness (partial then full) acts in scene without stock epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of wall-whispers and object revelations builds to Conceptual Repricing closure—"Someone had to tend the echo"—with undeniable conceptual cost of eternal pause in the silo's held breath; orientation anchored early in first paragraph, one tightening via full gift-opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silo's curved walls, spiral stairs, and fireplace remnants constrain navigation and supply tactile diaries/tapestry that charge discoveries and final image of "walls dense with listening"; sensory hierarchy (echo over sight, paper taste) reflects Thrain's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of assembling wall-stories escalates accumulatively through deepening revelations (diary "axis has shifted," child drawing), narrowing to realization that reweights her isolation with felt purpose-cost; agency in probing forces the trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical existential shifts emerges organically from particulars like shifting dragons and spiral time perception, with final image offering non-literal resonant answer—"stories...ready to remember themselves into being"—reweighting remnants without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature ("navigate by echo," feeling pen-pressure) modulates rhythmically under rising awareness; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly in closure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax/rhythm propels via images like "pages crumbled...impressions that outlasted ink"; no loops/artifacts, figurative consistency (dragons moving, heartbeats pause) in peak beats supports closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-human listener, wall-echoes, and medieval axis-markers via tactile history transforms tropes; risk-taking in textured Accumulative CR ("bronze-quiet...pause between heartbeats") heightens stakes inevitably from particulars.</comment>
