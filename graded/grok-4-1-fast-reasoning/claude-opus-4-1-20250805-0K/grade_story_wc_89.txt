<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to reforge the bond drives concrete micro-choices like uncorking the vial under Silverwhisper's pressure, with contradictory impulses embodied in trembling hands and firm voice. Internal conflict shows through beast imprints blurring her edges before reunion. Change earned as transformation holds with cost of human boundaries lost; minor label-speak in "paradoxically steady" doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent builds density of visions/imprints to CR closure where Mira reconfigures as bridge, cost legible in "outwardly human but fundamentally altered." Orientation anchored by orchard/phoenix timing in opening paragraph. Single scene, no shards; fortune's blank reprise seals without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pearl-white blossoms shifting to scales/feathers constrain the "cinnamon meets starlight" ritual and charge final moth image. Sensory hierarchy via scent permeating reality reflects Mira's whisperer bias. Atmosphere of cosmic fairy-tale tensions human dissolution purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforge bond) signaled early, tightens via scent's explosion narrowing to visions/reunion under Accumulative lens. Agency in vial uncorking forecloses human path with felt cost of dissolution. Minor abstractness in "greater tapestry" slightly mutes visceral price before Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of love's frequency shift emerges from particulars like Kess in wolf/butterfly/oak, resonating in "patterns...interconnected" without statement. Final fortune-to-moth reweights premise non-literally. Subtext in fox's eyes and moonlight promise carries cosmic intimacy ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in beast-filtered multiplicity; voice modulates from firm dialogue to formless whisper. Dialogue natural/subtextual—"paradoxically steady"—distinguishes characters. Rhythmic compression in transformation visions heightens without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory/propulsion, e.g., "petals becoming scales, becoming feathers" varies rhythm without loops. Metaphors coherent, no overwriting in peak scent beat. Clean syntax propels to moth closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of beast whisperer dissolving into cosmic web transforms phoenix trope via spice-scent doorways. Risky Accumulative expansion of consciousness feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold fairy-tale orchard as metamorphosis site heightens stakes organically.</comment>
