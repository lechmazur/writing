<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's embodied precision ("hands danced through the suspended collection") reveals character-specific motives rooted in ancestral preparation, earning the final realization; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal sorting beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as seed density and temporal drift build to Charged Poise closure in garden reform/placement of acorn, with legible conceptual cost ("could unravel causality itself") in final acts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Icebound atrium under starlight constrains alignment-timed actions (acorn glows "through the atrium's crystalline dome") and charges final image (ice subliming reveals wood for shoots).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of safely wielding vortex tightens via stabilization ("vortex began to slow"), forcing entropy trade-off with felt causal risk charging closure under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of inheritance as gifted continuation emerges from seed particulars (Cherokee Purple, Dragon Tongue), resonating non-literally in final planting/reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("texture of borrowed time... like velvet") stable in single POV, rhythmic control heightens temporal drift without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High-density propulsion varies rhythm effectively; minor figurative density ("bristling in others") in mid-beats nears overwriting but supports accumulative texture without loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of heirloom seeds as time vessels transforms tropes into inevitable temporal garden reopening, with bold premise commitment heightening stakes organically.</comment>
