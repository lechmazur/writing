<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in trembling fingers and chalk-stained hands reveals artist traits under pressure; motivation to make invisible visible earns final realization. Minor slip: epiphany at "she finally understood" edges toward unearned directness without more contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-building from sand mandala to shifting grains; Conceptual Repricing closure lands cleanly in tile crumbling to complete design, with legible cost of impermanence in "mist would eventually scatter it."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto's acoustic curves and lilac mist constrain mandala design and charge final glowing walls; recurring sand and tile evolve tactilely, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding meaning in silence tightens accumulatively via tile flake and self-shifting mandala, forcing acceptance with felt cost of deliberate forgetting; one deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unlearning as composting emerges organically from whispers-to-songs map; final image of chalk/sand readiness offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (patterns in cave, chalk as wonder) modulates rhythmically; stable single POV filters all through artist's bias, no slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "milk through water"; minor paraphrase loops in "whispers" (early/mid) are pattern-taught for textural hush, not obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic grotto, unlearning ritual, and evolving mandala transforms forgetting trope; tile flake's heat-to-dust arc feels inevitable and risks bold lyric closure.</comment>
