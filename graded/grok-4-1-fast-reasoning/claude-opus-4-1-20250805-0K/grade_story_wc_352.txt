<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prism-mind trait enables contradictory perceptions ("all three were true") acting in navigation, compelling higher-stakes memorization; final shift to planting seeds earned by revelation costs, with embodied stress in "burn into their prism-mind."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as doodle revelations densify to CR closure in Orin drawing new doodles ("each one glowed faintly"), reweighting vigilance cycle with conceptual cost of eternal containment legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto with mist and inverted gravity constrains propulsion ("kicked hard against the stone archway," "pushing off stalactites"), charging emergence ("mist clung... carrying secrets") as micro-setting mirroring prism-mind multiplicities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to access combinations deepens accumulatively via node press, forcing timed extraction as "gravity shuddered"; agency in prism-navigation narrows options with felt inversion-ending cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vigilance as immune system emerges organically from node visions (empires, plagues) to final doodling image reweighting knowledge as "latent blaze... carefully controlled," embracing containment complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with prism-signature noticing ("in one stream... in another"); diction/rhythm modulate urgency ("boots splashed... pebbles dance upward") to reflective poise, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels inversion beat ("water droplets fell upward like silver rain"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors integrate without muddle in peak navigation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism-mind synthesizing inverted physics, doodle-blood warnings transforms forbidden-knowledge trope; fresh inevitability in archivist-as-seed cycle risks bold fantasy logic payoff.</comment>
