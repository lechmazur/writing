<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marcus's contradictory impulses—reaching for the valve wheel then stopping—reveal a hierarchy of values (skepticism vs. respect for stories) with embodied cost in his "drowsy alertness." Interiority concrete and particular, like tracing sweating bricks amid radio static. Final renunciation earned by prior radio-deepened motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: radio fragments densify toward valve discovery and CR closure ("He left the valve wheel where it belonged... the weight... settling into his bones"). Orientation anchored early (tunnel descent, 1982 closure). One tightening via confession chorus narrows to witness role with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tunnel's pipes "like the mill's circulatory system" and rusted junction box constrain discovery; valve wheel as recurring object charges final image ("left... in the space between confession and absolution"). Sensory hierarchy (headlamp cuts dust, radio crackles) filtered through explorer bias. Atmosphere tensions decay with ghostly hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appraise swallowed truth) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via radio density to agency at "reached for it, then stopped," foreclosing removal with conceptual cost ("weight... stay with him"). Pressure coheres without reversal overload; cost legible in renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unabsolvable guilt emerges from radio confessions to CR ("Some confessions... meant to be witnessed"), reweighting exploration premise without moralizing. Final image ("first light touched the mill's broken windows") offers non-literal resonance, charging prior fragments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: decay stories via "metal tombstones," "dust that hadn't stirred since 1982." Voice modulates rhythmically under pressure (short confession snippets), diction biased toward Methodist questioning. Radio dialogue natural/subtextual, advances via interpreted guilt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory/propulsion (e.g., "radio caught fragments... chorus of night-shift confessions" advances multiple jobs). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (beads "like DNA strands"). Propulsion peaks at discovery without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: radio psychics as ghost-shift confessions transforms haunted factory trope into textural guilt accrual. Risky CR closure via witnessed artifact elevates beyond template exploration. Irreplaceable valve specificity anchors originality.</comment>
