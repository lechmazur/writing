<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in sundial handling and chest upheaval; motivation rooted in flaw of avoiding paternal lies earns final renunciation with cost. Minor slip in rationalized epiphany phrasing ("serene upheaval complete itself") borders diagnostic but doesn't flatten pressure. Contradictory impulses layer via chase vs. confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sundial inscription to confession reveal, culminating in CR closure ("every legend... a mirror") with conceptual cost of self-confrontation. Orientation anchored immediately in barge/canal/twilight. No lens ambiguity; persistent sundial constraint shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sundial as micro-setting constrains discovery and charges closure image (reflection creating "impossible shadow"). Sensory details selective via archaeologist bias (fingers "read surfaces like braille"). Twilight barge evolves with lights/dusk, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chase legends to evade personal truth) signaled early, tightens via compartment reveal mirroring father's deceptions, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative lens. Agency in opening sundial and decision to confront; cost legible in foreclosed running. Entry to 8+ via trade-off in final pocket/dock beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of self-built lies emerges organically from sundial confession paralleling father's sweatshops; final barge/bridge image offers non-literal reweighting ("hindsight... clearest view") without moral. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; counter-reading (legends as distractions) lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (instincts sensing "hollow spaces"); diction/rhythm modulates from serene to charged ("canal held its breath"). No elision or head-hopping; prose as character reflects weathered seeker's clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "gnomon cast no shadow" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor register elevation in epiphanies but voice-consistent; zero figurative muddle in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh inward twist on legend-seeker trope synthesizes archaeology/history into personal mirror; sundial's "impossible shadow" turn inevitable from setup. Risks quiet CR closure effectively without gimmickry.</comment>
