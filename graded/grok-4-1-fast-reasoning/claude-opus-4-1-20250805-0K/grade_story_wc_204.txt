<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moth's contradictory impulses—filing the destabilizing bottle vs. uncorking it—act simultaneously in the scene, earning her final printing choice with the visible cost of the library's dissolution. Interiority is concrete and particular, embodied in frost-patterned fingers under pressure. Flaw of perfectionism complicates and resolves authentically in rupture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns and whispers builds to on-page Conceptual Repricing where Moth scatters into frost, reweighting negotiable reality with the cost of lost perfection legible in "The Glass Orchard Library dissolved around her." Orientation anchors early; single scene fits scope. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Frost patterns on glass walls constrain choices (transcribing, finger movements) and charge the final image of Moth scattering into tomorrow's frost. Sensory details selective via POV (shade of longing in whispers, crystalline trees chiming). Setting evolves causally with rupture, mirroring internal destabilization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (system stability vs. whisper's paradox) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through trembling shelves to uncorking agency, narrowing options with library shuddering as tightening. Cost unmistakable in sinking library and freed whispers. Pressure coheres under lens to Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of rupture as revelation emerges organically from particulars like bottled eternity and frost maps, answered non-literally in final scattering image that reweights perfection's premise with conceptual cost. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in negotiable reality's cycles. Recurring awakenings charge without token motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature: noticing whispers by timbre/shade, frost as prophetic maps. Rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, compressing at peak ("She uncorked the bottle."). Purposeful elision of backstory anchors to present cues like arriving bottle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "eternity folded into itself like origami made of time" advances concept and texture); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language consistent and pattern-taught, no muddle in peak rupture beat. Read-aloud ear confirms propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress, bottled whispers, and glass orchard transforms surreal tropes into inevitable rupture logic. Bold risks in accumulative surrealism heighten stakes (system's beautiful destruction) without gimmickry. Non-obvious final reconfiguration feels earned from early frost patterns.</comment>
