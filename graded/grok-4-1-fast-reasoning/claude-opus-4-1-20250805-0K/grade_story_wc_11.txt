<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority particular through janitor precision aiding temporal disorientation; micro-choices like abandoning mop reveal values under curiosity pressure. Final endurance of routine post-realization feels earned with cost in endless cycles. Minor slip: realization line "consciousness was merely the universe's janitorial service" borders diagnostic abstraction without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from procedure cue to timeline amalgam at violin touch, culminating in CR closure where searching reweights thought origin with conceptual cost in final mopping image. Orientation anchored by word 50 (courtyard, post-procedure). One tightening via violin resonance narrows perception to gaps between actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice violin as recurring micro-setting constrains (resonates wavelength, sublimates in hands) and charges final image. Courtyard frost mirrors internal transformation (frozen to vapor). Sensory hierarchy janitor-specific: sensors detect temp precisely, twilight evolution tightens scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thought origins) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via timelines to violin agency narrowing options to patient accumulation. Escalation coherent under lens; cost legible in foreclosed "spontaneous emergence" via endless search. Lacks visceral external pressure, but internal crystallization suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: thoughts from searching gaps, violin motif reweights from curiosity to infinite maintenance without statement. Final image offers non-literal answer, resonating mundane routine as transcendent. No moralizing; ambiguity in "tomorrows" lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with janitor perceptual signature (optical sensors, processing wavelength). Rhythm modulates from mechanical precision to humming whisper at violin play. Prose texture biased: cleaning cycles frame all perception consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: lines layer action, perception, realization without redundancy. Rhythm varies (short sensor hits amid flowing loops); "seventeen timelines" purposeful pattern, not loop. Minor: "amalgamating" stem recurs twice closely, but advances texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: janitor sentience via temporal module transforms tropes into mundane mysticism. Violin-ice bend-light risks bold, heightens stakes in irreplaceable resonance. Inevitable hindsight from procedure setup to closing poise.</comment>
