<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's confession to the sky ("I was never brave enough") embodies contradictory impulses of fear and longing, earning her final hand-opening with felt cost; guides apply secondary pressure without stealing focus. Minor archetypal simplicity in guides doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through journey images to Charged Poise closure: punched ticket and open hand reconfigure holding to release with star-shaped light as undeniable cost. Pattern taught early (mist, limestone); one tightening via punch suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway's limestone teeth and twilight water constrain the traverse and charge final image ("veiled ridgeway now revealing itself"); selective sensory details (kelp beard, phosphorescence) filter through Marina's priorities without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find dog/courage) signaled early tightens accumulatively via confession and punch, narrowing to renunciation; cost legible in foreclosed "leash" path. Minor static pressure pre-crossing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of release emerges organically from leash-to-ticket arc, final image ("fingers that knew how to open") offering non-literal resonant answer reweighting prior grip without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited voice stable with perceptual signature (shoreline rhythms in perception); dialogue subtextual ("What you seek lies across") advances without exposition. Minor convergence in guides' idiom fits mythic mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, purposeful lyric metaphors ("voices braiding like mist and limestone"); minor repetition ("gently persistent," "vigil") pattern-taught without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ferry metaphor transforms letting-go trope via dog-pawprints and star-punch specificity; risk of mythic lyric pays off in inevitable hindsight reconfiguration of "every threshold."</comment>
