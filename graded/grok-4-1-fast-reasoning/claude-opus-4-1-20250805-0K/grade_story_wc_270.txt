<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Chen's motivation via plant-whispers intensifies to compel the unsealing despite patrols, with embodied steadiness in her hands; secondary insurgents apply relevant pressure without deeper distinction, slightly limiting relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain from stolen amber to kite-decoded formula to unsealing holds tightly, landing DC closure when "amber cracked, releasing... lieutenant's implant sparked" with legible cost to Authority control; orientation anchored early in springs scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Volcanic springs supply minerals for formula and bacteria for absorption, constraining the ritual; final bubbling/kite soars recharges setting, with sensory selectivity via sulfur-mist and green pulses mirroring Chen's enhanced perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to undo implants tightens via patrols' approach forcing circle formation and pour; agency in unsealing forecloses destruction path with visible spread cost, though soldiers' arrival borders convenient under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of evolving tradition emerges organically from amber release over preservation, resonant in "evolved tradition not by preserving it in amber but by releasing it" and plant visions of futures without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in "pulses of green thought"; sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven ("Grandmother, the patrols grow closer"), modulating under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in rhythmic builds like "amber cracked, releasing not a physical creature but a cascade"; no loops, varied syntax, metaphors cohere without muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neural implants unlocking plant memory as resistance network, culminating in genetic reset via embryo; kite decoding transforms abandonment into key, risking bold eco-revolution premise organically.</comment>
