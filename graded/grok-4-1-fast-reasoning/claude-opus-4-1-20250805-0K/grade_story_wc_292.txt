<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied ("spongey dread pressed against her ribs like wet wool"), with contradictory impulses (idealistic certainty vs. dread) driving micro-choices like inserting the nail. Final broadcast earns change via prior causality, with felt cost of inherited responsibility. Dr. Hayward's intercom pressure reveals her defiance. Minor flaw: "nervously confident" borders on label-speak without full embodied trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: nail insertion reveals islands → overlays routes → broadcasts coordinates (DC) with storm cost legible in "station shuddered" and "evacuation alarms wailed." Orientation anchored early (weather station, post-jet stream). Single scene, one tightening via satellite heat signatures. Closure cost undeniable in final nail-warming image reconfiguring options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Station hum, "waterlogged pages reeked of brine," barometric shrieks constrain choices (evacuation vs. broadcast); copper nail as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory hierarchy fits Elara's priorities (journals over storm initially). Storm evolves causally, mirroring internal shift. No 9+ as occupational details (bathymetric readings) don't fully alter a peak tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor ancestor, expose exiles) signaled early, tightens via "population heat signatures" narrowing options amid storm pressure. Agency in calculations/broadcast forecloses evacuation path with on-page cost (shuddering station). Causal escalation: revelations force stance crystallization. No reversal needed; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of "maps would remember" emerges from particulars (nail, journals, beacons), resonant in final broadcast reweighting oversight without moralizing. Subtext in "official records couldn't acknowledge" creates irony. Closing image answers "bringing home what oceans keep" non-literally. Minor drift: bravery motif slightly overt in whisper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (maps over storm); diction textured ("oxidized surface bearing traces of cemetery earth"). Dialogue natural, goal-driven (Hayward urges evacuation, advancing pressure). Rhythm modulates with stress (short sentences in storm). No head-hopping; inference matches knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density: lines integrate action/sensory ("holographic projection shifted"); rhythm varies (long reflective openers to punchy alarms). Minor paraphrase loop in dread descriptions (−0.3), but no closure touch. Clean syntax, strong verbs; opening anchors stakes. Slight overwriting in metaphors ("wet wool") doesn't muddle peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: copper nail as magnetic navigator transforms exile trope via jet stream logic. Risky premise (phantom islands via storm) follows implications to closure without retreat. Turn via "bringing people back" inevitable from journals. Transformation elevates familiarity (+0.3).</comment>
