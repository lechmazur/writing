<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sage's characterization excels through embodied doubt ("no longer trusted her nose") evolving into ancestral gift awakening, compelling the journey choice with visible cost of ending retirement; contradictory impulses surface in initial sensory distrust versus bloodline pull, earning final howl.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as leaf/cylinder revelations densify stakes toward Charged Poise closure in valley ("sanctuary grown from preserved seeds"); orientation anchors early (Heap den), cost legible in "retirement had ended and begun simultaneously."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Scrapyard's "tower-stacks of crushed automobiles" and "glass craters" constrain travel while charging final valley image; sensory hierarchy (rust scent, failing eyes) biases via bloodhound POV, mirroring internal shift from loss to hope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (follow child's riddle) deepens accumulatively via gift awakening and journey risks, narrowing to new role crystallization; cost felt in "no longer find bodies but help the living," though external pressure leans situational without full agency test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief-to-connection emerges organically from leaf's vein-routes and child’s line ("distance isn't measured in kilometers but in grief"), reweighting premise in howl's "summoning" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable bloodhound POV with perceptual signature ("bloodhound bones," chromatic pull); voice modulates rhythmically from hushed den to dawning howl, dialogue sparse/natural ("Following a scent").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("The grooves held microscopic etchings—text so small..."); minor figurative density in revelations ("color-tinted revelations") purposeful, no loops, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of phonograph grooves as mind-pressed texts and leaf as magnetic map transforms post-apoc tropes; risk in dog ancestral navigation pays off inevitably at valley payoff.</comment>
