<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is embodied via tears catching prismatic light and warm stone, with motivation rooted in 30-year tenure and grandmother's legacy compelling her interface activation. Final purpose shift earns via footage causality, foreclosing doubt with felt regret cost. Minor epiphanic polish at "understood her purpose" prevents 9+ as impulses act but lack peak contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from stone tracking to shadow metamorphosis, culminating in on-page CR where dream immersion reconfigures preservation stake with luminous regret cost at "felt a luminous regret." Orientation anchors early via staircase ascent and 2084 footage. Persistent stone constraint shapes tactics to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Blooming library's glass petals refract light and shift with interface sync, constraining dream-sharing action while charging closure via "eternal dusk deepened into colors that had no names." Sensory hierarchy POV-filtered through Mira's archival gaze. Recurring bio-glass mirrors internal dawning without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel shadow via footage) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through timeline sync to metamorphosis reversal narrowing doubt-to-purpose options. Agency in placing stone and activating interface drives deepening. Regret cost legible in tears and transcription commitment, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hope's preservation emerges via shadow's hope-collection across decades, resonating non-literally in final stone shadow as "quiet witness" reweighting generational waiting. Subtext in translucent figure touching hope frames invites ambiguity on dream-shares' limits. No moralizing; complexity in shadow's patient tethering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in "walls that hummed with stored memories" and biased archival noticing. Rhythmic control modulates from deliberate ascent to peak dream immersion. No head-hopping; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with lines like "shadow had been migrating, untethered from physical law" advancing revelation and texture; rhythm varies for propulsion. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—"dark aurora" coherent. Minor overwriting in perpetual sunset refracts contained by pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Unbound shadow migrating via stone across decades synthesizes dream-tech with ancestral hope-preservation ingeniously, transforming trope into fresh CR payoff. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick; irreplaceable particulars like footage frame feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
