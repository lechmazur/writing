<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "daringly methodical" protocols during the accident flashback versus trembling hands now; micro-choice of drawing personal map on wall reveals values and earns renunciation of data-obsession with felt cost. Minor therapy-speak in realization ("permission to move on") slightly dilutes embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density (vines, graffiti, bellows) builds to Conceptual Repricing closure in notebook entry ("Mile marker zero") reconfiguring chronicling; cost legible in "no map, just wrote what he saw," foreclosing backward-gazing path. Single scene anchors orientation by para 2; tightening at graffiti map sighting narrows options to personal confrontation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivy "tapped against broken windows like patient fingers" and graffiti walls constrain choices (prompts his map) and charge final image of "green overtaking gray"; tactile bellows dust "wheezed out like a confession" embodies micro-setting. Sensory hierarchy reflects chronicler's bias toward organic transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guilt-forgiveness via mapping) signaled early; Accumulative deepening at graffiti ("the river knows") forces internal reversal, narrowing to self-drawn map with agency and cost of admitting "failing." Visible price in altered chronicles alters tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>River motif shifts from obsessive data to flowing permission in final notebook image, resonating non-literally on forgiveness-as-current without moralizing; emerges organically from particulars like drowned things and graffiti wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in chronicler-specific notices (pH readings, sediment layers); rhythmic control modulates from sharp post-med edges to poised closure, with stable single-POV distance tightening on embodied stress like "hands trembled."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density in lines like "vines had worked their fingers into every crack, the same way guilt had worked into his bones" advances image and emotion without loops; varied rhythm propels to closure, metaphors cohere around flow/decay.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of river science guilt, graffiti oracle, and ivy reclamation transforms redemption trope; risky reflective accumulation feels inevitable in "the current that carries us forward," heightening stakes via personal map turn.</comment>
