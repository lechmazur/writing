<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between old portraitist precision and fragmented seeing act vividly in the cubist nightmare commission and Moon card reflection; final redesign earned via embodied grief ("cracked and luminous with grief"). No safety-hedging; flaws like fear drive struggle without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from box tracing to beam blazing; CR closure in "universe answered by showing her everything at once" with conceptual cost of old seeing's death. Orientation anchored instantly in lighthouse library; single scene tightens meaningfully without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lighthouse library constrains via charcoal use and walls' embrace altering tactics; charges final image with upward glass and blazing beam. Sensory hierarchy (salt, dust, waves) narrows under crisis, POV-biased toward painterly bleed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redesign seeing) signaled early, deepens via sketching on cards foreclosing old precision; agency in untangling forces trade-off, cost felt in "grief for her old way." Accumulative pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of shattered wholeness emerges from particulars like drifting faces and threaded walls, resonant in final image reweighting breakage as glow without moral. Rhetorical questions add purposeful ambiguity; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in watercolor metaphors ("bleeding into each other"); rhythmic modulation peaks in short, cracked laugh line. Compression taught early via angle-shifting cards, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "walls groaned... pressing closer" advances plot/atmosphere); no loops, varied rhythm supports propulsion. Figuratives consistent, voice-motivated without muddle in peak redesign beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal fragmentation via tarot in collapsing lighthouse transforms cubist tropes through painter's descent; risk in parallel realities heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight beam blaze.</comment>
