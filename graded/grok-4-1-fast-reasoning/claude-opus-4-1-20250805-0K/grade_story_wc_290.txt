<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in descent—"his claustrophobia already clawing... focused on his breathing"—earning the closure transformation where fear reconfigures into audacity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: music density builds to nexus CR, reweighting space as mutable with conceptual heresy/freedom cost in "even they could be moved"; orientation anchors instantly at blueprint entrance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Impossible angles and starlit stone constrain choices during shifting passages, charging final image where "stars continued their dance, but Marcus knew their secret."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcome fear to claim key) deepens via music-guided reversal through rearranging corridors, forcing endurance with felt cost in overridden paralysis; agency in "walked forward" narrows options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mutable space vs divine law emerges organically from mutiny-made architecture and organ defiance, resonant CR in "boundaries waiting to be redrawn" reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in geometric precision ("corners that shouldn't exist"); rhythmic control heightens under stress, as in organ "reverberating through his bones."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm; minor figurative density ("geometric wound") purposeful in opening but thins cleanly at nexus peak silence, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartographer heresy and organ-guided spatial fold transforms exploration trope; risk in non-Euclidean nexus pays off in inevitable CR hindsight.</comment>
