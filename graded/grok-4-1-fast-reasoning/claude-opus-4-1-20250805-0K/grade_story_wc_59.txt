<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aldric's motivation to reawaken beauty drives consistent micro-choices like scavenging and vigilant adjustments, with embodied exhaustion (gaunt frame, fevered eyes). Contradictory hope/failure crystallizes in cradling the flawed bird, earning stasis with felt cost. Minor slip in unearned epiphany ("If life began once...") borders stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to hatching glow/cracks/song. Orientation anchored early (palace over mechanical city). Closure as Charged Poise in naming Novo reconfigures imperfect genesis with bittersweet cost legible in "succeeded and failed simultaneously."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Suspended palace/stalactites constrain via swaying chamber and scavenged parts, charging final "eternal dance." Sensory selectivity (groaning chains, tick-tick-tick) mirrors urgency; mechanical city below evolves to pause at song. Micro-setting (crystalline floor, aviary) guides choices without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hatch songbird for beauty) signaled early, tightens via flawed emergence narrowing perfect revival. Agency in vigil/acceptance under Accumulative lens; cost viscerally felt in "wings... twisted, asymmetrical" and bird's "broken song." No reversal overload fits length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect beauty emerges organically from hatching and city's pause, reweighting mechanical world's premise in final image without moralizing. Subtext in "some circuits... remembered beauty" invites ambiguity. Protagonist arc inextricable from flawed genesis question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: lyrical bias toward poetry in math ("mathematics could be poetry"). Rhythm modulates from tremulous setup to charged poise at naming; no head-hopping or filter excess. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (egg placement, cracks leaking note); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor overwriting in metaphors ("music box missing half its pins") accumulates without muddling peak hatching. No loops; purposeful lyricism fits tone over artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk decay and genesis myth via flawed songbird stirring gears transforms tropes organically. Risky quaking reverie heightens stakes; "a broken bird sang the world's first new song" feels inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
