<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction via fractured forgiveness pixels confronting past selves; embodied in fiddle against chin and trembling bow. Final choice to play backwards earned by prior causality with cost of self-repricing. Minor therapy-speak slip in "pixelated amnesty" epiphany slightly undercuts peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of motifs builds to CR closure when glass flake pulses and hitchhiker materializes, reweighting regrets as steps with conceptual cost of new purpose. Orientation anchored early ("mountain scenic pullout"). Playing melody backwards as tightening beat legible with cost in fading hitchhiker.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass flake and fiddle constrain choices: held to sun reveals scaffold patterns, fiddle weaves shimmering air for closure image. Sensory selective (silver light, amber air, warm wood). Mountain wind mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sense impossible vanishing) signaled early, tightens via flake revelation narrowing to self-forgiveness. Protagonist agency in reverse melody forces stance crystallization under accumulative lens. Cost felt in pixelated past selves pulsing, charging final map image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of sculpting possibility from regret emerges via bridges/music/pixels, resonant in final image of notes as doorways. Hitchhiker's line "You've been granting amnesty all along, pixel by pixel" is thematic echo (-0.5), articulating thesis too directly in penultimate beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: winds as sheet music, shadows dancing. Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates (short urgent sentences in climax). Dialogue sparse but subtextual ("Play me across"), distinct voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm matching scene (shimmering air in climax). Minor figurative density in reflective beats (e.g., "dissolved like morning frost") risks overwrite but pattern-taught pays off at closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fiddle notes as reality bridges, pixelated self-forgiveness from wet-plate image transforms magical realism tropes. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes via irreplaceable glass flake map. Inevitable in hindsight from early observant trait.</comment>
