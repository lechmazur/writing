<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's expertise-driven micro-choices like releasing mantises and locusts earn his endurance at the door burst; Serena's rogue charm pressures via cryptic delivery, revealing recruitment history without flattening present tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain from Serena's seed delivery to insect releases narrows options against Auditors; Charged Poise closure at door burst with Marcus smiling amid "rain" locusts delivers legible conceptual cost of defiance, lens holds Causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse insects (beetles scrambling frequencies, locusts as "rain") constrain tactics and charge final stand; sensory wing hum and humid gleam filter through Marcus's entomologist bias, evolving with releases.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of botanical defiance tightens via Auditor pounding and progressive insect waves forcing tactical trade-offs; agency in Marcus's releases forecloses escape, cost felt in tunnel divergence and door confrontation.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of resistance as "ecosystem" emerges via garden patterns and insect chaos without statement; final image of planting under sun reconfigures chaos into grammar, resonant non-literal answer to commodified thought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Marcus's perceptual signature (wing-beats as shield); cryptic dialogue advances goals with subtext, voice modulates tension via rhythmic "hummed with ten thousand wings."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density in insect releases advances pressure without loops; minor overwriting in "photosynthetic rebellion" slightly blurs peak Auditor beat but rhythm propels to crisp final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of entomology thwarting neural scanners via wing static transforms dystopian trope; "chaos...grammar" turn inevitable from garden/insect particulars, bold without gimmick.</comment>
