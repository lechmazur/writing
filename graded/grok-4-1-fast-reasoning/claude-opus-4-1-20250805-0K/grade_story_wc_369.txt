<comment>Marcus's interiority shines in embodied details like "tingling began—old cuts sealing," rooting 30-year motivation in concrete maintenance evolving to purpose; final installation earns change with felt life-cost. Contradictory acceptance (heals without understanding) resolves organically without therapy-speak. No safety-hedging flaws complicate his steady competence.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of revelations (sextant etchings to tree shadows), one tightening at pin-drop silence charges CR closure: reassembled sextant maps "space between loss and understanding" with conceptual cost of transformed purpose. Continuous scene anchored early (Marcus descending stairs). No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>

<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Moonlight/stormlit tower constrains choices (powers projections, heals hands) and charges final ivy touch; sensory hierarchy (thunder/pin drop narrows to silence) mirrors realizations. Labyrinth carvings evolve causally, tactile (oiling walls, laying pieces). Micro-setting (broken dome ivy) recharges end image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (purpose beyond maintenance) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via sextant discoveries narrowing to tree-witness epiphany; agency in deconstruction forces trade-off (destroys precision for new mapping). Cost legible in "grooves in the mind like water on stone." One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Quantified sorrow emerges from particulars (encoded grief equations) to resonant CR: trees' "patient math of survival" reweights loss as growth without moralizing. Subtext in shadows/leaves shifts meaning organically; invites ambiguity (heals "forward to what might be"). No tidy binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (maintenance lens: "oiling the rotating walls," trees as "whispering calculations"); rhythmic prose modulates from storm urgency to dawn poise. No withholding or leakage; diction biased to precision/math.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>High density (multi-job lines like "moonlight touched his weathered hands, and the familiar tingling began"); varied rhythm accelerates in deconstruction, breathes in revelations. Zero loops/artifacts; metaphors cohere (growth rings) without muddle in peak (pin-drop).</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: labyrinth as "machine for processing sorrow" via sextant-math-diary transforms tropes; risk in lyric CR (broken tool measures precisely) heightens stakes inevitably. No derivatives; bold conceptual integrity commits to mundane miracles.</comment>
