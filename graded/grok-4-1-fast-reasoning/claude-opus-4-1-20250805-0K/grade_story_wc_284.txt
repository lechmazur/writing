<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Margot's steady accusation ("You let me burn") clashing with embodied tension ("chest tighten"), earning her final choice to pocket items and deliver with visible cost of reframed past.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through pillbox to snow-codes to Viktor's folder reveal ("The break was intentional"), landing Charged Poise closure as she pockets both pillboxes—reconfiguring burn as freedom—with felt cost of three years' running legible in "lighter than three years of running."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mist and refrozen snow constrain prudent approach ("careful work: Cyrillic letters formed by packed snow"); final dispersion charges image of "world spread out... looking small and fixable," mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve burn) tightens via causal reveal of mole proof, forcing agency in folder pickup; cost unmistakable as "heavier than any mission," charging poise without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transformation ("no longer burned but forged") emerges organically from melting snow-codes and final bluff vista reweighting premise without statement; resonant non-literal answer in "everything broken could be mended—or... transformed."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature ("silver hush") and distinct voices—Margot's controlled compression vs. Viktor's careful exposition; dialogue subtextual ("I'm sorry for Moscow") advances under causal pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("mist swirled... like a curtain"); no loops, purposeful figurative control (e.g., "ghost in the machine") integrates without muddle in peak reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Snow-codes and pillbox synthesize spy tropes into fresh causal engine; risk of lyric mist-frame heightens stakes, transforming burn into "unused courage" inevitability.</comment>
