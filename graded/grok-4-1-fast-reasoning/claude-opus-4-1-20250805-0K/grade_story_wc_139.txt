<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's contradictory impulses—honoring her father's body while exposing his sins—act simultaneously through her uninterrupted embalming during confrontation, earning her final calculation of love minus sins. Wei's arc from rage to acceptance feels character-bound via inherited traits. Final renunciation of full restitution carries visible relational cost on page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: door breach incites revelations that narrow options to honest trade, culminating in Charged Poise closure where Wei takes pot/envelope, reconfiguring debts with conceptual cost (soul's reckoning). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. One tightening via ashes reveal suffices; no micro turns disrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prep room's sensory details (fluid like mercury, chemical-sweet air, humming vitality) constrain Maya's choices, forcing dialogue amid embalming precision. Father's body as micro-setting evolves (joints massaged to lips stitched), mirroring transformation and charging final image of burial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fair restitution signaled early tightens via causal revelations (records, ashes), forcing Wei's stance crystallization; Maya's agency in withholding full truth until pot reveal forecloses vengeful path with legible cost (partial justice via living payment). Escalation driven by her micro-choices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of honest mathematics emerges organically from records' interest calculations and final "subtracting his sins from her love," offering non-literal resonant answer in closing image without moralizing. Ink pot's shift from stolen relic to ash-filled apology reweights premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Maya with distinct perceptual signature (equations over cons); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven (Wei's "That's not enough" draws agreement testing stakes). Rhythm modulates with pressure, compressing in stitches/closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "threading a needle to close her father's lips" advances action, closure, theme); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors (anger "liquefying") enhance without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of embalming as honest transformation subverts con artist trope; ashes-in-pot twist risks bold redemption calculus, feeling inevitable from father's records and Maya's traits, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
