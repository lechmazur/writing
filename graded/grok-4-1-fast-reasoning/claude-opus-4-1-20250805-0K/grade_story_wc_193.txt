<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied motivation shines in repeated pendant touches grounding Marina amid pressure; internal conflict between bitterness and bright laughter acts in scene. Final bolt-turn choice earned by prior cues but borders unearned epiphany. Dr. Chen applies light pressure without voice distinction slip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of glitch messages and converging promises builds to CR closure via diamond transformation with conceptual cost of repricing past loss. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene with no shard breaches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bioluminescent cavern and pendant bolt constrain climax choice (turning under pressure peak) and charge final diamond image. Sensory details (pulsing light, drifting spores) selective via Marina's priorities. No white-room; lived-in via harvest action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmute broken promises under pressure) signaled early, tightens via bolt-turn agency narrowing destructive to creative options. Cost legible in inverted crushing weight and past scheme repricing. Lens escalation via density increase to convergence peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of pressure-as-creation emerges organically from particulars (pyramid irony, promise crystals); final light-diamond image reweights premise without statement. Minor Thematic Echo risk in "dancing with it" line but subtextual enough. No moralizing closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias (glitch streams as parallel selves); rhythmic prose modulates from glitch chaos to clarity. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-pursuing ("You're early"). No head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with pressure (short glitch bursts to expansive final image); high density integrates sensory/motif without loops. Minor figurative density ("shadows dance backwards") purposeful, not muddying climax. No scaffold or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Surreal premise (physicalized concepts, quantum promises to diamonds) transformed via pyramid survivor arc; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight. Risky metaphor-flesh world heightens stakes without gimmick. Final capstone message reconfigures tropes organically.</comment>
