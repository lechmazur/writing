<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in staying while others flee act in scene; final endurance earned by syncing with orchard's pulse, with embodied cost of aching muscles and ringing body revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: resonance density builds to pattern break ("fractal spiral began to wobble"); on-page Charged Poise closure ("current released its hold") with felt cost in her collapse and new endless coordinates.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Driftwood nodes and cloud-script constrain strikes and adjustments; mallet as micro-setting charges final pulse; sensory hierarchy (vibrations in bones, whales' bass) mirrors urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape via sound) signaled early tightens accumulatively through whale addition and visible light-traces; agency in precise strikes forecloses collapse with physical cost legible in collapse and ache.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("every obstacle... waiting for the right prophet") offers non-literal resonant answer to "curse as salvation," reweighting chains-to-freedom via her smile amid endless currents.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature (cloud-script as sheet music, sonic engineering) with rhythmic control under stress; purposeful poetic diction taught early, legible at whale-song intensification.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density (e.g., "sketched resonance—temporary sound-shapes... invisible architecture") propels with varied rhythm; no figurative muddle in peak strikes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic fractal disruption on driftwood xylophone transforms sea-trap tropes; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens endless-cycle stakes inevitably.</comment>
