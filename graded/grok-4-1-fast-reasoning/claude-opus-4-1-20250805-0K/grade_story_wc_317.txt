<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation roots deeply in her escape-room expertise, driving micro-choices like planting and tending with embodied clarity; internal conflict emerges subtly in recognizing preservation over mere puzzles. Final understanding feels earned via prior textual buildup, foreclosing passive reception for active guardianship. Minor smoothness in epiphany slightly tempers peak contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from seed-planting through growth patterns to CR closure in blooming realization, reweighting urban wildness with conceptual cost of ongoing guardianship. Orientation anchors early (envelope, coordinates). Time elisions legible, pattern-taught; no ambiguity at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Nocturnal haven and pulsing soil constrain choices (planting site, protection shimmer) and charge final brook image; sensory details (moonlight, babble shifting linguistic) filter via Mira's puzzle-biased POV. Micro-setting (seed, roots) evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve innovation spaces vs. development) signaled early, escalates texturally via communal tending and note, narrowing to stance crystallization in "innovating space itself." Agency in nightly returns bears felt cost (margins vs. mapping). One tightening sufficient, cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mystery-preserved spaces emerges organically from seed-to-bloom arc, reweighted in final spathe note and seeds needing guardians; resonant non-literal answer in fragrant possibilities counters stench trope. Complexity lingers in urban wildness tension, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with puzzle-attuned perceptual signature (geometric roots, linguistic babble); rhythmic prose modulates from electric hush to singing closure. Lyrical compression taught early, pays off legibly; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; metaphors cohere (flowing logic, orthogonal roots) without muddle in peak growth beats. Propulsion aligns with textural buildup; minor poetic density risks overwriting but serves voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corpse flower as protective mystery-space innovator transforms escape-room tropes via urban brook haven; risk in non-stench bloom heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from seed to guardianship seeds.</comment>
