<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei's zen potter traits shine in precise movements ("measured steps, her movements precise as throwing porcelain") and clay-sun pattern linkage, earning the final realization; minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to thrumming crescendo/silence, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure ("understanding flooding through her like glaze"); cost legible in "three lifetimes" seeking and world's fractures reweighted by oasis anchor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hives in hexagons, scorched earth cracks, flattening smoke constrain choices (follows shadow, waits for signal) and charge final image (golden-tinted glass, rebuilt hives vision); sensory hierarchy POV-specific via potter's sun/clay lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand resistance) deepens accumulatively via glass visions, hive reveal, smoke sync; agency in sitting/observing forecloses ignorance with felt cost of lifetimes, charging poised return image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kindness/sun harmony as temporal anchor emerges organically from beekeeper dance mirroring potter patience; final image ("throw pots in the shade of rebuilt hives") resonantly reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (sun patterns, clay rhythms) and rhythmic prose ("thrummed against her spine with each step"); diction modulates intensity purposefully to charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors (e.g., "glaze settling on bisqueware" ties voice); minor stacked figures in revelation beat don't muddle closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractured timelines, kindness-phototropic glass, bee-sun anchor transforms post-apoc tropes into lyric inevitability; risk-taking in conceptual closure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
