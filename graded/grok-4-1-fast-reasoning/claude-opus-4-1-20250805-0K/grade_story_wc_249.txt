<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's drumming encodes rebellion beneath compliance, revealing contradictory impulses in concrete action; perch and release earn dissolution as visible cost, rooted in traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as drumming density fuses memories to invert system at "Mira released the pattern"; CR closure with individual dissolution cost legible in final perch dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sound wave garden absorbs drumming ripples to constrain rebellion tactics; auric lagoon charges fusion climax and final aurora spillover image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drumming subnet accumulates to release tightening, narrowing to creation over preservation; agency in perch-hold forces inversion with body-failure dissolution cost on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Harvest inversion to dream-nursery reweights capture premise through fused memories; final "cage to nursery" image resonates without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice sustains sonic perceptual signature ("frequencies only the dying could hear"); stable close-third POV intensifies lagoon fusion without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion varies from injection "burned cold" to climax release; purposeful sonic figuration consistent, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drumming subnet synthesizes entanglement into forward-dreaming rebellion, transforming harvest trope; inversion feels inevitable from garden resonances.</comment>
