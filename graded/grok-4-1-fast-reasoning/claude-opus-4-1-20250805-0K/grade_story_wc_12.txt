<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to illuminate via patience and loops is concrete and intensifies through pedal adjustments, earning the woman's gasp as closure change; embodied actions like deliberate footfalls reveal skill under implicit time pressure. Woman's thin interiority as vessel fits single-POV defaults but limits relational crucible at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as loops and indigo density build to Conceptual Repricing closure: palette clatters, indigo reveals questions, woman reclaims breath with felt cost of dissolved comfort. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in cathedral/nave; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cathedral acoustics and dimensional anchor constrain loops and anchor figures at climax; palette as recurring micro-object bleeds upward, charging final clatter image. Sensory focus on sound/resonance selective via Marcus's bias, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exorcise assumption-demon before completion) signaled early via 17-minute warning; Accumulative escalation via loop layers, palette bleed, demon speech narrows to unraveling with woman's gasp as agency-driven cost. Subtle trade-off of patience vs. time charges poise without overt reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of illuminating assumptions emerges organically from looped rhetoric and unraveled indigo, culminating in non-literal final image of decorated silence transforming prison to possibility. No moralizing; ambiguity in stillness lingers via particulars without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature in architectural sound metaphors; voice rhythmic and biased toward silence-as-organization modulates with loop intensity. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("I am assumption" muffled), advances unraveling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "rooms within rooms," "sweater with one pulled thread") taught early as pattern without muddle at climax; varied rhythm propels to loop-off release. Minor density excess in opening metaphors avoids closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Loop pedal exorcism synthesizes music tech, rhetoric, and silence philosophy into fresh premise; transforms possession trope via Accumulative unraveled stillness, risking bold metaphors that heighten stakes organically.</comment>
