<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied emotion in tingling fingertips and drifting consciousness; micro-choices like tuning by intention reveal hierarchy of values, earning final renunciation of Guild path. Contradictory impulses (Guild training vs. fragment resonance) act simultaneously during shard entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with orientation anchored by ~50 words (Maya at towers over gorge); closure as CR in fragment darkening and dawn arrival reweights premise with time cost legible in "six hours, though it felt like moments."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective (crater shadows, swaying cables mirroring sway); constrains climb and tuning, charges final image of gold-painted towers as city will "sing again." POV bias filters through interpreter's electromagnetic lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hunt shard) signaled early, escalates via density increase in tracing histories during shard entry; agency in intentional tuning narrows options, with cost in fragment's burnout felt at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence as communication emerges from particulars like reverse echoes and hush potential; final image of cool fragment reconfigures "every ending" premise without statement, lingering with ambiguity of unmonetized data.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (stars' "electromagnetic poetry"); rhythmic modulation peaks in shard's "door" opening, diction controlled and biased toward frequencies.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with lines like "every supernova sang its birth song in reverse" advancing world and theme; varied rhythm, no loops, purposeful lyricism without muddle in peak trance beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic silence and Hollywood Nebula fragment transforms trope of signal-hunting; risk in backward-time echoes feels inevitable, heightening stakes through irreplaceable fragment's arc.</comment>
