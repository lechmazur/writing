<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's methodically curious trait roots clear motivation in concrete micro-choices like synchronizing videos and UV analysis, earning her final softening into shielded openness. Interiority particular via map-reading lens on hesitations and oils. No strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but endurance of curiosity builds to credible change without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via video sync and map tear to CR closure in palm press and smile, reweighting silence/empathy with cost of self-exposure in the record. Orientation anchored early in vault with Elara's tools. One tightening at video comparison narrows to henge coordinates; final image ("pressed her palm against the torn map's edge") makes cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rain-scoured vault and torn map as micro-settings constrain choices (UV on thumbprint, footage under leaking roof) and charge final palm press. Sensory hierarchy (hammering rain narrowing to texture change) reflects Elara's perceptual bias. Details evolve (water stains spreading) mirroring discoveries without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode silence/maps to henge) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via video gestures and oil coordinates, forcing stance crystallization in decision to go/reopen. Agency in precise comparisons forecloses isolation for exposure. Visible cost in final record addition charges image under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of wordless empathy emerges organically from map tears, silent videos, and ritual continuity, resonating in non-literal final image of palm oils bridging known/unknown. Complexity lingers in fragile truths resisting speech. No direct statements; earned via particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (hesitations in lines, shadows in footage) biased to Elara's cartographic eye. Rhythmic prose modulates from precise analysis to softened reflection. No elision or head-hopping; diction controlled and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "torn the parchment precisely where the known world ended, creating a ragged boundary that itself formed a message"); varied rhythm accelerates in discoveries. Zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; purposeful figures like "water stains spreading like continents" integrate without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: hidden henge in thumb-oil coordinates and silent video rituals transforms map restoration into wordless communion. Risky accumulative lyricism on silence pays off in charged CR without gimmickry. Non-obvious angle on sacred spaces resisting cartography feels inevitable via particulars.</comment>
