<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority in phantom stitches and embodied optimism shines, compelling higher-stakes sewing despite others deeming it impossible; minor dilution from reflective backstory summaries slightly undercuts simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal morning ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from trance emergence to plate activation; closure as Charged Poise in "illustration plate slipped... impossibly alive" reconfigures ruin-to-reverence with conceptual cost of forgoing restoration, constraint of paths shaping final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Labyrinth's rearranging paths and barnacle-petroglyphs constrain sleepwalking choices; plate as recurring micro-object charges closure image of dancing children on walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mythic transformation signaled early tightens via plate warming/movement, forcing endurance with felt cost of barren-ground persistence; agency in air-sewing forecloses old-world return under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emerges organically from plate's bleeding hues to children's wall-dance, offering non-literal resonant answer to ruin/reverence without moralizing; final orchid image reweights prior fragments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct weaving-infused perceptual signature and rhythmic modulation (e.g., "needle pierced the air itself") sustain close third-person stability under pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "new" motifs in final third) and synonym churn around "threads/paths" dull slight momentum without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh tidal-maze weaver synthesis transforms flood tropes via air-stitching and sleep-path spirals; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
