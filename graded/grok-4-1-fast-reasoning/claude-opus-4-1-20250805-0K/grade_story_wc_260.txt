<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via trembling fingers holding the tail while justifying past deception, earning the final confession choice with visible cost in sanctuary closure; interiority particularized through vet-specific observations like micro-sutures. Minor diagnostic edge in "facades falling away" but embodied overall.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from tail observation to surgery to confession CR, reweighting deception with undeniable cost in "tomorrow would bring investigations"; orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene causality tightens via chip removals narrowing to truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass roof panels as "windows into judgment" constrain emotional choice and charge final image; mist-dampened walls absorb confession tactilely; sensory hierarchy vet-biased (scales shifting, sutures); recurring tail evolves with action, mirroring internal stripping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstruct truth post-exposure) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via surgery micro-choices deepening knowledge of self-deception; agency in reattachment forecloses deception path with felt cost (animals' futures); one tightening sufficient, charges chameleon testing tail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fragile convictions emerges organically via chameleon metaphor shifting from artificial to natural; final image (tail curl, glass touch) offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moral; subtext in wonder of children vs. lie lingers ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (chromatic details through vet lens); rhythmic control modulates from shimmering observation to precise surgery prose; diction purposeful, compressing reflection without withholding; no dialogue, internal voice coherent/specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with lines doubling action/atmosphere (e.g., "stars wheeled overhead through the workshop's sky panels"); varied rhythm, no loops; minor register elevation in "perpetuate lies" but propulsion clear; closure image crisp without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Chameleon mod/con as fresh synthesis of bio-ethics/redemption, transformed via tail reattachment risking wild survival parallel; risk in quiet CR heightens stakes organically; inevitable hindsight from opening severed tail to curled grip.</comment>
