<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to grasp time's texture roots in consistent designer traits, intensifying via fragment visions; embodied emotions (trembling fingers, warming palm) contradict entrapment impulses. Micro-choices like stepping onto the pulsing bridge reveal values under pressure, earning her final liberation. Closure renunciation of the fragment's curse feels compelled by prior iterations shown in visions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fading photographs and bridge whispers builds to CR closure where fragment dissolves, reweighting time as creatable with conceptual cost of lost selves. Orientation anchors Elara/garden/fragment by para 2. Single scene/shard fits scope; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic bridges constrain choices, curving paths to touch time's granularity and charge final knot convergence. Sensory details (chlorophyll whispers, moss twist) filter through designer's bias, evolving with her walk to mirror internal shift. Garden pulses with decay/growth, lived-in via vines recognizing her.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape retrocognitive trap) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as visions layer and fragment warms, narrowing to center confrontation. Protagonist agency in navigating geometry forecloses entrapment path; cost legible in dissolving selves charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of time as woven/grown emerges from garden particulars and fragment images, not stated; final laugh rustling leaves reconfigures premise without moral, reweighting memories as mutable. Resonance from wild memory vines vs. designed texture avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in close-3rd, perceptual signature synesthetic (time granular like fragment edges); rhythm modulates from whisper-tremble to laughing reverie. Compression of visions taught early, paid in closure poise; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene breath (short revelation sentences amid lyrical swells); density high, metaphors coherent (watercolor bleeding to sugar dissolving). Minor figurative density in peak visions ("fading photographs" purposeful pattern) but no loops obscuring closure; strong verbs propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of maze/time-texture via retrocognitive gardens transforms trope; risk in hyperbolic geometry/nonlinear selves heightens stakes, inevitable in fragment's dissolve and eternal reverie image.</comment>
