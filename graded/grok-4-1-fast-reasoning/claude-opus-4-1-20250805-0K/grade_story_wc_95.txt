<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mechanical arm backstory anchors motivation rooted in past loss, compelling choices like tracing patterns; relationship with Reeves forces alliance under opposition, shown in synchronized "Revolution." Internal conflict subtle but embodied in "intellectual exertion"; voice distinct in clipped, precise dialogue vs. narrative lyricism. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: invitation via needle card leads to duel building invisible sundial patterns toward Charged Poise closure where arm's final gesture completes trinity with felt exertion cost. Single scene oriented early (atrium, brook by para 1); no causality breaks, pattern taught via angles matching. Closure cost legible in "breathing heavily" and ongoing secrecy risk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass atrium's prismatic light and brook integrate tactilely, mirroring verbal "fence" chaos; mechanical arm as micro-setting constrains transcription, charges final matching gesture. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (brass clicks, whirring under Marlowe's notice); no white-room, evolves with sun shadows. Recurrent brook "gurgles approval" subtly tensions theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (encode revolution) signaled via decoded angles, escalates texturally through syllogism density to framework creation, narrowing to coded trinity. Agency in parries forces trade-offs like "destruction of certainty"; cost visible in exertion, foreclosing overt force. One tightening sufficient; minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of questions-as-destinations emerges organically from duel turning inquiry into "map," reweighted in final needle card promise without moralizing. Subtext in synchronized words and sparkling eyes implies alliance depth; final image resonates, recharging theorem with conceptual cost of dogmatism. No tidy binaries, embraces ambiguity in "revolution that might never need to happen."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Marlowe with clean perceptual bias (arm whirs, patterns traced); dialogue subtext-heavy, goal-driven ("anarchy" counters "construction"), distinct idioms (Reeves' pacing formality). Voice texture modulates rhythmically, lyric under calm building to terse exchanges; no head-hopping, inference matches knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "brass fingers leaving trails of light" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies, read-aloud natural. Minor figurative density ("philosophical jazz," "dignified chaos") in descriptive beats borders overwriting but pattern-taught via angles; no loops, clean syntax. Slight anthropomorphism ("brook gurgled approval") nudges down.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of philosophical duel as coded revolution via needle perforations and air-traced sundial transforms tropes organically. Risky conceit (angles as language) heightens stakes through secrecy, inevitable in hindsight via invitation-response arc. No derivatives, bold voice commits fully to premise.</comment>
