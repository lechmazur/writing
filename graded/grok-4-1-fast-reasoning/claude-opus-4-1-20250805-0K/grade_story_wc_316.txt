<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's numbness embodied in "chest tightened—not with emotion, but with the memory," shows contradictory impulses acting in scene; final jar pickup earns change via prior sparring causality with cost of prior opposition foreclosed. Master Chen applies crucible pressure without stereotypes. Voice distinct in dialogue idioms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single scene orients instantly via jar and hall; Hybrid lens (causal dialogue to accumulative insight) holds to CR closure in "I picked up the jar, feeling its weight... potential for it," with conceptual cost of "shared death" legible in final image. One tightening via sparring mirrors thesis-antithesis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating dojo's low gravity and Earth view constrain sparring choreography and charge final transparent-floor image mirroring internal shift. Crystalline walls and hum integrate selectively through POV bias. Jar as micro-setting recurs to constrain choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant numbness stake tightens via sparring reversal narrowing "enemy" view to synthesis, driven by agency under Hybrid lens; cost unmistakable in "sculpted by your mutual loss" foreclosing rivalry path. One deepening suffices, pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of synthesis from opposites emerges via sparring pattern to resonant final image of jar-as-future-child, reweighting numbness premise without moral; "Numbness... waiting to be born" integrates as earned CR, not statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in numb-filtered noticing (e.g., "hollow as the stone chambers"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, distinguishing Chen's koan-style from Marcus's flat affect. Rhythmic control modulates to insight flood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., sparring sentences vary rhythm to hypnotize); zero loops, varied openings, no artifacts dulling closure image of jar weight. Strategic telling anchors reflection to present cues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clone trope with Hegelian opposites in sci-fi dojo yields inevitable third-mind CR; risk of vivification premise transforms custody via philosophy, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
