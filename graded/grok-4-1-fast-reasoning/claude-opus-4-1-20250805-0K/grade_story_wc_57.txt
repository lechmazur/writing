<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to preserve knowledge roots consistently in her seed-collecting trait, shown concretely in decoding knots despite numbed fingers; interiority particular via fractal/nature parallels. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously slightly tempers, but endurance earns closure commitment to teach. Final plan to gift fulgurite reveals values hierarchy with generational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via knot decodings (storm warning, rocks) tightening preservation stake toward CR closure in coiling rope and teaching plan. Orientation anchored early (dock, snow, kneeling by ~50 words). Cost legible in lineage loss and dawn storm warning, reconfiguring options in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details selective (snow dissolving, fog hush, numb fingers) filter through Mara's pattern-seeking bias, constraining patience in cold. Dock isolation and rope as micro-setting guide decoding choices; fulgurite recurs to charge ending image of interconnected wisdom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve vanishing knowledge) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via decodings narrowing to teaching imperative by end. Agency in patient coaxing forecloses loss with felt costs (cold endurance, lineage finality); pressure coheres without reversal need under textural lens, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of encoded wisdom emerges organically from knot/nature fractals, culminating in CR: "knowledge persists in forms we've only begun to recognize" reweights premise via eternal fog image without stating moral. Subtext in global weaver parallels invites ambiguity on preservation's fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-POV with perceptual signature (weaving metaphors, pattern-tracing) and rhythmic modulation (short puffs amid lengthening reflections). Prose texture distinct, diction POV-bound (maritime knots, tidal plants); no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, reflection without loops; rhythm varies (puffs to oceanic hush cadence). No artifacts, precise verbs (coax, traced); final line recharges motifs propulsively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knots as storm math, fulgurite fractals, global fiber-encoding transforms preservation trope organically. Risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via rope's revelations.</comment>
