<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the scene—voicing silence while heart hammers—earning the final integration of the echo as Kova's voice with embodied cost in her changed humming. Cool-headed traits root steady choices under soul-tug pressure. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing; micro-choices reveal fisher's values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to pattern break and echo yield; closure as RR (Charged Poise) lands on-page with conceptual cost legible in "Kova stood changed... humming a feral lullaby." Orientation anchored early in garden and liminal night. No causality breaks; one tightening via circling echo suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rail spike and sound waves constrain choices (casting into rippling air, feet between feelings) and charge final image (flowers bloom in winter air). Sensory hierarchy filters through fisher's priorities; details tactile and purposeful, evolving with star descent. No white-room; spatial coherence in garden navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch echo) signaled early tightens via echo's testing circles transliterating emotions, forcing endurance; agency in silence and zigzag narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable in spike burning and soul-tug yielding to reconfiguration. Escalation driven by Kova's poise amid rising density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of enduring songs emerges organically from hunt particulars, culminating in non-literal CR: "some songs never die, they just learn to swim in different seas" reweighting patterns without moralizing. Final image resonates via changed voice casting into wounds. Ambiguity lingers in cure/curse readiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature: fisher notices resonances and bends over noise. Lyrical diction and rhythm modulate with intensity, prose as character in steady mist-breath phrasing. No head-hopping or withholding; compression purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (short tugs amid lyrical swells), no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful (vertical rivers, ice bells) without muddle in peak dance. Opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic fishing in emotion-garden with sleepwalking stars transforms tropes; zigzag echoing star-paths feels inevitable. Bold fantasy risks cohere without gimmickry, heightening stakes in pattern-break premise.</comment>
