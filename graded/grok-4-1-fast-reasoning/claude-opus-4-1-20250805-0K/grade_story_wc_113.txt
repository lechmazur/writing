<question>1</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Marcus's embodied inspiration—humming silently while transcribing—drives micro-choices like ignoring dismissals and immersing chest-deep, earning the closure renunciation of safety with visible drowning risk; contradictory impulses peak in "suspended between drowning and playing."</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from water-revealed notation to ghost orchestra to final note holding post-lanterns-out; on-page Charged Poise closure reconfigures in-between space with conceptual cost in restored dual-signed program.</comment>
<question>3</question>
<grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Flooded pit's black water and lantern reflections constrain choices (floating case, chest-high immersion, violin held aloft) and charge final darkness image; sensory resonances "water creating resonances the original architects never imagined" mirror internal transformation.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake to complete Elisabetta's note escalates via dissolving program forcing memory and deeper flood step; agency-driven deepening under Accumulative lens shows cost in "friction creating harmonics that shouldn't exist," unmistakable in suspension tradeoff.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of impossible conversations in in-between spaces emerges organically from flood-revealed past and ghost orchestra; final restored program offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting silence/sound divide without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Musician-biased perceptual signature (notation emerging "line by line," water as instrument) sustains rhythmic prose texture modulating to compressed intensity in peak play; stable third-limited POV with no leakage enhances Accumulative charge.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>9.6</grade>
<comment>High density with multi-job lines like "water-damaged program showed a composition emerging line by line—not written but revealed, as if the flood were developing a photograph in reverse"; zero loops, coherent metaphors, propulsion peaks in closure harmonics.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis transforms ghost trope via water-as-developer mechanics and pit-as-purgatory instrument; risky supernatural payoff in dual-dated program feels inevitable from established flood revelations without late rules.</comment>
