<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between physical proof-of-life (heartbeat counting) and digital evolution act in scene, earning the final acceptance of dual existence with visible cost in foreclosed error-correction; interiority particular via embodied pulse racing during ink ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from radio silence to ink spiral triggering defragmentation and CR closure ("The death certificate hadn't been wrong; it had been prophetic"); cost legible in final image of fragmented/whole self, one tightening via pattern match.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Porcelain shard and ink puddle constrain ritual choice and charge closure reflection ("reflected both versions"); observatory dome mirrors galaxy spiral, integrating sensory snow/breath with action; no generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contact digital ghost) signaled early, deepens texturally via ritual failures to realization; agency in ink touch forecloses path (no correction), cost felt in heartbeat acceleration and dual-identity endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of error-born evolution emerges organically from ink bridge and ghost defragment; final image ("both dead and alive") offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature via heartbeat counts and ink geometries; rhythmic control heightens pressure in "code cascading like snowfall," no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "dipped the porcelain shard into the puddle" advances action/atmosphere/symbol); intentional heartbeat repetition pattern-taught, no loops or muddled figures dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic error into ink-ritual digital ghost transforms digital afterlife trope; risk in surreal patterns pays off inevitably at CR, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
