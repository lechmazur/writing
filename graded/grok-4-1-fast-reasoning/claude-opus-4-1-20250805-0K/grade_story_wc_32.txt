<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in scene ("preservation could holiness endure, but... breaking was the only path"), earning final blood sacrifice and rebirth choice with visible cost; interiority concrete via scarred hands and keen sensitivity mistaken for slowness. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: iterations build density to 23rd attempt's CR closure ("penny dropping... reborn"), with blood cost legible in "opened his scarred hands and let his own blood drip." Orientation anchored by para 1; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nexus heat constrains advance ("eyes water, but... didn't flinch") and charges final emergence; sensory hierarchy alchemist-specific (heat as catalyst, ash swirls mirroring attempts). Twilight-to-night evolution mirrors internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove wrong via transformation) tightens accumulatively through failed forms to agency-driven blood choice, foreclosing restoration path; cost unmistakable in heresy realization and "nothing would ever be the same."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Creative destruction emerges implicitly via "Destruction was just creation wearing a different mask," reweighted non-literally in reborn crozier's final image against Church preservation; complexity lingers in heresy acceptance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with alchemist perceptual signature (formulas, mixtures, "flicker of life"); rhythmic control heightens pressure in chant adjustments, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("thrust... blackened instantly"); varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors ("dying heart," "frozen bloom") integrate without muddle or loops, even in peak 23rd attempt.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical heresy via successive rebirth transforms relic trope organically; "vivify through destruction" risks bold premise payoff without gimmickry or templates.</comment>
