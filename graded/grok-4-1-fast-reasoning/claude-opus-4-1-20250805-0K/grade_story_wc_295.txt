<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's gift to heal with words enables pivotal sharing ("her healing words softening the edge of cosmic loneliness"), earning the collective shift; interiority concrete via star-decoding gift. Minor slip in stock phrasing ("understanding dawned slowly") away from closure doesn't touch final renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelations build density to CR closure in placing digital card ("We carry this together now"), reweighting burden with ongoing cost legible in relay image. Orientation anchored early (observatory, telegram); one tightening via star match suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory dome, telescope brass, V442 pulses constrain choices (viewfinder adjustment) and charge final atlas placement; daylily as micro-setting recurs with evolved meaning. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (starlight whisper, whale-song audio) integrates into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode cosmic relay) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via matched patterns and predictions, narrowing to shared endurance; cost felt in "burden was heavy, but shared... bearable." Agency in chronicling forces crystallization under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of intergenerational relay emerges from particulars (pressed clues every 40-50 years), final image reprices isolation via "pass it forward" without stating moral. Daylily reprise shifts from solitary truth to shared purpose organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Mira POV with perceptual bias (stars as morse code); dialogue goal-driven ("The stars don't wait") advances revelation with subtext. Prose texture modulates rhythmically, distinct from characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short revelation lines vs. flowing descriptions); no loops or scaffolds dull peaks. Minor figurative density ("stained glass" petals) purposeful, not muddled in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of variable stars as consciousness clocks transforms discovery tropes; risk in cosmic relay premise inevitable in hindsight via pressed clues. No hedging, commits to dream-star logic fully.</comment>
