<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shines in concrete details like the thread pulsing with connection and mapping wounds' topography, revealing character through embodied grief-work. No strong contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, keeping it from 9+. Final realization feels earned by her projections and micro-choices like writing Marcus's obituary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of absences builds to CR closure where "healing was not a destination but a map" reweights unraveling with conceptual cost of persistence. Single garden scene fits defaults; orientation anchored early ("shadowed garden," post-ship). Final thread-pull image makes cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shadowed garden's frost-edged roses and dry fountain mirror internal erosion, constraining via thread as divining rod that charges closure. Sensory selection (perfume, amber leaves) purposeful, POV-biased toward loss; recurring thread/object evolves tactilely. Final wind-stirred glimpse of Marcus ties setting to payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping healing's geography) signaled early, deepens via Marcus's tremor felt in projection, narrowing to realization under textural lens. Agency in projecting/writing forecloses forgetting; cost felt in "souls already halfway" and final synchronization. Charges poise without live option killed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of healing-through-unraveling emerges organically from thread pulls and projections; final "map" image resonantly reanswers premise without moralizing. Subtext in explained absences (Marcus's cardamom wife) builds complexity. No tidy resolution—embraces lingering ambiguity of "lonesome splendor."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual signature ("geography of their particular wounds"); stable close-third POV with bias toward translucent presences. Rhythm modulates poetically from observation to charged insight; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly. No head-hopping or leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "thread grew warm... pulsing with heat of connection" advances emotion/action). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; figurative language consistent in lyric pattern without muddle in peak realization. Minor overwriting in garden descriptors but purposeful, not obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: projecting obituaries for living via unraveling thread transforms abandonment tropes into healing-map CR. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes of persistence; non-obvious angle on loss feels inevitable in hindsight via "explained absences."</comment>
