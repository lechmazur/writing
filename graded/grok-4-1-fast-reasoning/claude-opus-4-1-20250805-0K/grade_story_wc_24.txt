<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via embodied key grasp and counting ritual reveals contradictory impulses between grandmother's mechanical legacy and hydraulic present; final realization earned by ritual's cost in imperceptible horizon shifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as countdown density reconfigures time premise at "Zero" with CR cost of lost mechanisms legible in pocketed key.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fjord mercury reflection and hydraulic gurgles constrain ritual choices, charging final horizon log image with Earth's turning continuity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of clock understanding deepens accumulatively through countdown narrowing to bridge-role epiphany; felt cost in foreclosed mechanical past alters stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of time-as-distance emerges organically via key/water/horizon particulars; final "razor edge" image resonantly reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in clock "languages" (clicks vs flows); rhythmic countdown modulates under ritual pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion; purposeful counting repetition avoids loops, clarifying closure key pocket without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hydraulic-mechanical synthesis transforms time tropes into fresh CR; risk-taking lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
