<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Empirically intuitive trait shown concretely through touch-reveals on chip and maps, compelling higher-stakes choice at doorway; contradictory unlived paths ("expedition to Morocco") act simultaneously with forward impulse, earning reconfiguration without epiphany labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chip touch to ants' march to cavern map builds density toward Charged Poise CR at "Marcus touched the doorway"; cost legible in fading regret-paths, reconfiguring seller-to-follower stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cavern's "impossible summer light" and "crystalline pools" constrain choice via chip-reading, charging final image; selective touch-sensory hierarchy (ants' lines, kudzu curtain) reflects cartographer's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightens accumulatively from shop stasis to regret-map revelation narrowing options; agency in pressing chip forces trade-off with unlived lives' cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final "step through" image reconfigures journey-selling premise into beginning-maker without moral; theme emerges from ant-map particulars, lingering on topology of choices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Touch-biased perceptual signature ("fingers worried the matrix chip," "pressed the chip against the stone") stable in close third; rhythmic modulation heightens revelation without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; dense propulsion in cavern beat ("bloomed with impossible summer light") varies rhythm, integrates revelation without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Matrix chip as map-reader synthesizing touch-intuition and ants transforms promise trope; risky topology premise commits fully, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
