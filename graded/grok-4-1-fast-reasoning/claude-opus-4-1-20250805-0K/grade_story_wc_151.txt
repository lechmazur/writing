<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular in chalk symbolism and client reading, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure; serene process shows endurance without micro-choices revealing value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds ritual pattern; CR closure in "rain would wash it away" reconfigures transience with conceptual cost of impermanence felt in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marble floor and skylights constrain chalk work and charge final survey/leave; selective sensory details (chalk scrape, truck engines) filter through Mira's priorities, mirroring internal nostalgia.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of timely pseudonym craft signaled early, but no on-page reversal or deepening narrows options; serene execution lacks agency test or visible trade-off under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of true self in pseudonyms emerges organically via chalk margins and mail ritual; final "seeds of an older, newer world" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting instant vs. waited connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature in symbol decoding and color arcs; rhythmic control modulates from deliberate arcs to glowing gold without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric rhythm varying sentence lengths; no loops or scaffolds, metaphors cohere in "constellation of symbols" without muddling peak completion beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chalk hieroglyphs for mail pseudonyms transforms postal nostalgia trope; risk in QR-ancient hybrid feels inevitable, heightening stakes of human waiting.</comment>
