<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ezra's interiority shines in embodied recognition ("luminous ache") and micro-choices like striking the tuning fork, earning her final purpose shift from reluctant guardian to documentarian with felt cost of forgoing escape.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup (tremors to eddies to threads); Charged Poise closure lands cleanly when clock rewinds, reconfiguring tension with conceptual cost of suspended purpose in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome glass, cables, and Earth below constrain stakes (station's near-tear-free); tuning fork and camera as micro-settings charge choices and final healing image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stabilize clock/station) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via camera revelation deepening knowledge; cost legible in rewound foundations and Ezra's endurance over escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of suspension between states emerges organically from time-threads and gap-photographs; final reflection-image offers resonant reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (mechanisms "speak," transformations recognized) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates pressure from whine to leaf-song hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("silver blur fragmenting"); no loops, metaphors coherent (time-threads taut), rhythm varies to ear-test perfection in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal sci-fi with leaf-fall fork transforms escape tropes; risk in lyric accrual heightens closure's inevitability.</comment>
