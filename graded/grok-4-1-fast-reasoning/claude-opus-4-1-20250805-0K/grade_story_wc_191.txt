<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Concrete interiority in embodied reactions like breath catching at the founders' mural and smile at realization; motivation intensifies through discoveries compelling the shift from seeker to sharer, though lacks sharper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building via paint layers to UV reveal and dawn song; CR closure lands on-page in ruby dissolution and orchard song fading, reweighting quest premise with conceptual cost of eternal unclaiming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shed's bubbling paint and bio-luminescent trees constrain peeling action and charge final song image; selective sensory hierarchy (visual fractals narrowing to harmonic bark) reflects lore keeper's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding stairway signaled early tightens accumulatively through deepening discoveries narrowing to choice renunciation; cost legible in flake's dissolution foreclosing personal claim.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of restraint over power emerges organically from mural sequence to song's "democracy reborn"; final image of returning with fragment offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting throne as guardian.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in archive-attuned details like chromium oxide; rhythmic diction modulates from adventurous to reflective without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., scanner detects while advancing); varied rhythm supports propulsion, minor overwriting in fractal metaphors contained without muddling peak reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quest trope into distributed data fragments enforcing collaboration; unclaimed throne as restraint monument transforms trope with specific colony logic charging closure.</comment>
