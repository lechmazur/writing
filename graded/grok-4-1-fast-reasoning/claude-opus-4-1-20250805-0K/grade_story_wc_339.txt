<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's interiority shines in embodied reflections like breath catching behind her mask and recognizing captain's frantic handwriting evolution, rooting her "first name basis with endings" trait in concrete micro-choices; final note-writing earns a meaningful reconfiguration with visible cost of library's contraction. Contradictory impulses act in contrasting Earhart's diminished myth with this preservation, compelling her analytic endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through discovery density building to CR closure in her note and ascent, with air pocket contraction as legible conceptual cost reweighting loss as transformation; orientation anchors clearly by para 2, no lens ambiguity. Final image of snow globe turning crystallizes infinite recursion payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via contracting air pocket forcing ascent and charges final surface-breaking image; sensory hierarchy (headlamp carving darkness, verdigris handles) filters through Marina's analytic gaze, evolving causally with water shift. Micro-object snow globe mirrors internal states purposefully without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding transmission's physics of letting go) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via journal revelations and air pocket tightening options; agency in photographing/writing forecloses mere recovery path with felt cost of imminent flood. One decisive deepening suffices, charging closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically from snow globe recursion and journal equations, reweighting premise in final note without statement; resonant CR ending image answers "loss as decay?" non-literally, lingering via captain's "energy simply changes frequency."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "death's language" and "frequencies only the ocean could conduct"; rhythmic modulation builds melancholy poise, diction biased analytically without withholding or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "spines like tombstones marking thoughts that outlived their thinkers"); zero loops/artifacts, varied rhythm reads aloud seamlessly, purposeful figurative consistency in recursion/transformation without muddle in peak discovery beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious premise synthesizes sunken archive, infinite snow globe entropy model, and post-Earhart frame into fresh CR on preservation; risk-taking in lyric accumulative drive transforms tropes, inevitable in hindsight via transmission invitation.</comment>
