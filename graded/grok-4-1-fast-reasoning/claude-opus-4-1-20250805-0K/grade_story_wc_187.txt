<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority in touching the central crystal floods her with humanity's shared moments, rooting motivation to preserve identity; embodied preemptive nostalgia drives her writing with felt cost. Minor shortfall: contradictory impulses more summarized than shown acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase in observations to CR closure: realization that "consciousness of loss... was what made them human," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of slipping moments legible in her writing and final gathering.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory and crystal pillars constrain choices via shadows telling stories and humming memories; rain-gleaming forecourt charges final image of survivors' faces lit by lightning, mirroring internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to sculpt identity amid fog-loss signaled early, deepens via writing conjectures that narrow options toward endurance; agency in quill-glow realization forecloses forgetting with legible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of cherishing as humanity emerges organically from particulars like crystal memories and shadow stories; final image of ritual gathering offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, though "what made them human" edges toward echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing of lightning's "silent theater" and crystal hums; stable close third-person modulates rhythm with emotional intensity, prose texture purposeful and voice-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with lines like quill trails "settling into the nearest crystal" advancing multiple layers; minor repetition of "deepening hush" purposeful for tone but borders loop without obscuring propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fog-stone apocalypse with crystal archives and shadow storytelling transforms memory trope; preemptive nostalgia as human core feels inevitable from particulars, risking lyric introspection successfully.</comment>
