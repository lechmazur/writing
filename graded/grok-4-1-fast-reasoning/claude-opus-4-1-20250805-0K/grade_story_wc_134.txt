<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera's motivation rooted in blinded visions intensifies through embodied reactions like teeth aching from pearl; internal conflict between future-sight reliance and present immersion acts in scene via clutching pearl amid spinning. Final change to expanded awareness earned by causal buildup, foreclosing old prophetic limits with felt void-cost. Minor diagnostic slip in "true nature of existence" line slightly abstracts epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via crystal harmonies and shadow patterns, holds through density increase to CR closure: pearl dissolves leaving luminescence, reweighting foresight premise with conceptual cost of transformed visions. Orientation anchored by ~100 words (cave entry, pearl pull). One tightening via shadow coalescence narrows to present-inhabitation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains via cave's magnification forcing perceptual shift; bioluminescent veins and singing crystals charge final image of skin-luminescence. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (visions voided, shadows inhabited). No white-room; spatial coherence in footsteps chiming crystals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (regain sight post-blinding) signaled early, tightens texturally via shadow-voice revelation and inhabitation expansion under Accumulative lens, foreclosing future-only paths. Agency in pressing deeper and sensing history; cost legible in pearl's dissolution altering gift. One deepening sufficient, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of present's everyday magic emerges organically from particulars like dust motes analogy shifting to cave history; final shimmering world offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting prophetic premise. Minor friction: closing "profound magic" line borders thematic echo, slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in "silver threads" visions and shadow-rippling; rhythmic control modulates from void-blindness to expansion. Dialogue subtextual, advances via corrections like "to open your eyes." No head-hopping; diction biased to seer priorities.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("overlapping shadows") taught as pattern; rhythm varies for immersion without loops. Minor scaffold in adjacent crystal-song paraphrases, but no closure touch; metaphors coherent (shadows breathing). Propulsion clear in expansion beat.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms clairvoyant trope via textural cave immersion into present-magic; steadily unpredictable shadows enable non-obvious CR. Risk in abstract made sensory heightens stakes; no derivative templates, organic from pearl pull.</comment>
