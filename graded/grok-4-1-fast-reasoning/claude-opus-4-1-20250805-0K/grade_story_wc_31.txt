<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Synesthesia trait roots motivation and perception consistently, driving the ritual acceptance with embodied sensory cost; final vow forecloses hiding path earned by journal causality. Minor epiphanic polish lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds revelation density to Charged Poise closure: Marlow's vow and lantern pulse reconfigure perception with conceptual cost of transcending ordinary senses, legible in "Our real work begins now." Orientation anchors early; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken library and deck constrain discoveries and ritual; key as recurring object charges final image of unlocking unseen doors. Sensory hierarchy via synesthesia biases vividly without catalog; spatial choreography coherent through descent/ascent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover color of sound) signaled early, tightens via journal revelations narrowing hiding vs. revelation; ritual agency forecloses prior isolation with felt sensory reconfiguration cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of revelation over hidden perception emerges organically from synesthetic events and vows; final image of lanterns as doorways offers resonant answer reweighting sensory boundaries without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with synesthesia perceptual signature biasing colors/sounds; rhythmic prose modulates from hush to symphony without head-hopping or withholding; voice texture distinct and pressure-calibrated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("concentric rings of deep violet") propels accumulative texture; varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synesthesia society's vows in drowned harmonics synthesize fresh metaphysical premise; risk of lyric perceptual prose heightens stakes organically, transforming tropes into inevitable perceptual CR.</comment>
