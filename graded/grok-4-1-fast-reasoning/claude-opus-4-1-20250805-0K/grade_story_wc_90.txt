<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Steadfast pacifist traits shine in recoil against screams yet steady stitching with intention, earning integration arc; contradictory impulses act simultaneously at "Her pacifist soul recoiled, but she held steady." Minor label-speak like "pacifist soul" slightly abstracts embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as meditation density builds to tear drop, dissolve, and stitching CR where "the dimensional barrier didn't break—it simply ceased to exist"; cost legible in shadow embrace and ship groan. Orientation anchored early in ship and Mei's solitude; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Photos' shimmering tears and emotional gravity constrain choices, charging closure image of weightless rise; body-as-micro-setting tactile in floating/tracing. Ship's patchwork hull subtly mirrors integration via "warships becoming gardens."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of compassionate integration escalates via density increase: knowledge heaviness to screams/whispers, narrowing to stitching endurance; agency in drop and weave forecloses denial with recoil cost. One tightening sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shadow integration theme emerges organically from grief photos to binding "light and dark," resonant CR in "first human complete" reweighting denial without moralizing. Particulars like first murder photo avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature meditative in "topology of sorrow"; rhythm modulates with intensity, as in whisper-scream buildup. AI dialogue brief, natural in grandmother voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful repetition of tears/shimmers; no loops obscure cause/effect. Minor figurative density in "oil on water" risks slight overwrites but integrates without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-human solitude, shadow Jungian work via photos/tears on recycled ship; transforms apocalypse tropes through pacifist integration, inevitable in "barrier ceased" CR. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes.</comment>
