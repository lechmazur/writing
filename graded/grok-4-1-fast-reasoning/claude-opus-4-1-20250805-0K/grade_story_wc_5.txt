<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength: motivation to map heartbeats rooted in concrete traits like flash-paper expertise; patience embodied in "fingers moving with deliberate care," earning final endurance with joint stiffness as cost. Minor lack: no simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene limits 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of placements builds to pattern completion as CR closure, with cost in "joints stiff from hours of kneeling" and "long walk home." Orientation anchored early in crater/orchard; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains via inverted trees' whispers and crater pulse shaping material choices; recurring debris charges final plate image. Sensory hierarchy (shimmering cores, singing caps) filters through alchemist's priorities, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heartbeat translation) signaled early, escalates via density to "delicate moment" tightening; agency in precise placements forecloses failure path with physical cost legible in climax freeze. One decisive deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of permanence from transience emerges via flash-paper transformation and final map reweighting "world breathes when no one is watching"; resonant non-literal close in plate held to stars avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (noticing "heartbeats between seconds"); rhythmic diction modulates from deliberate to crystalline in climax, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors coherent and pattern-taught (light "remembers"), no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in peak ("colors that had no names") dings slightly but supports lyric drive without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of flash-paper alchemy, inverted crater, starlight vials transforms tropes into inevitable map of "impossible places"; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
