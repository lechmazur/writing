<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional Marta with concrete interiority (gnarled fingers trailing hedgerows, smile "blooming and withering") and micro-choices under pressure (polishing marbles to remind plants); contradictory confidence in lies vs. low index drives endurance. Young woman's skepticism adds relational crucible without diluting focus. Final marble handover earns change with visible cost in passing wisdom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of marble-polishing rituals and vine deceptions builds to CR closure (luck "shifting... blooms in the cracks") with conceptual cost undeniable in final image of rustling maze. Orientation anchored early (maze, Ministry bulletins); single scene with interleaved reflections pays off without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garden maze as micro-setting constrains choices (navigating to center monument, farewell brushes) and charges closure (rustles like "laughter, like grief, like growth"). Sensory details (marbles clicking, vines whispering) filtered through Marta's bias, vivid and purposeful without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy measured luck via deceptions) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through inspector flashback and jasmine murmur to marble handover; agency in enduring low 2.1 index forecloses Ministry truth with felt cost in "forgotten to die" rose. Entry to high band via narrowing options in final pass to woman.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of conviction bending reality emerges organically from particulars (cracked marbles as "mended deception"); final image reweights premise non-literally—"gardens know their gardeners"—with resonant ambiguity in woman's skepticism. No moralizing; counter-reading in Ministry's math lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (plants as believers in lies) with rhythmic control (short declarative rituals amid lyrical swells); stable close-3rd POV, no leakage. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Perhaps your machine needs calibrating"), advances stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density (every line advances texture/character); varied rhythm propels accumulatively without loops or scaffolds—e.g., opening "gnarled fingers trailing" breathes into ritual beats. Figuratives purposeful/coherent (smile "ripening toward rot"), no muddle in peak closure handover.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of measurable luck vs. gardener's lies, transformed via marbles as "proof"; risk in lyrical defiance heightens stakes, inevitable in monument's loops and final rustle without gimmickry.</comment>
