<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied emotions via somatic markers and micro-choices like pruning reveal contradictory impulses of grief and cultivation; earned endurance in recalibrating nervous system forecloses denial with felt cost. Interiority particular, no stock phrasing. Minor diagnostic label-speak from Dr. Mansour slightly tempers peak authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of plant-work, body signals, and historical echoes builds to Charged Poise closure in final drive-home image, reweighting grief with persistence cost (dirt under nails as visible price). Orientation anchored early in arboretum. Single scene coherent, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cliffside arboretum, cedar bark, rosemary constrain choices (transplanting sapling) and charge final image (lighthouse sweeping ruins/living). Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward growth amid decay. Micro-setting (palm on bark) mirrors internal stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (optimism amid violence) signaled early, tightens via body-signal quieting and transplanting, narrowing to endurance under Accumulative lens. Agency in refusal to forget; cost legible in "both facts existed simultaneously." One deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Growth vs. erasure emerges organically from particulars (orchids to phosphorus, jade cuttings); final image reconfigures as non-literal answer to joy-as-suspect premise, with conceptual cost in inevitable return. No moralizing, ambiguity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (plant responses, somatic reads); rhythmic modulation builds texture under stress. Prose as character: syntax reflects quiet persistence. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds; metaphors purposeful (waves carving cliff). No artifacts, overwriting, or register drift; peak beats clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma-botany-somatic healing transforms survivor trope; risk in quiet stasis charges stakes via cliff/history indifference. Inevitable hindsight from early plant talent to final dirt-under-nails.</comment>
