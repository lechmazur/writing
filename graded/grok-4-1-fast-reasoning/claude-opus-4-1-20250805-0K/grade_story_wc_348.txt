<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via polymer analogies embodying grief's loosening; contradictory impulses in deleting texts show hierarchy of values. Final text send earned by causal buildup of ravine observations. Blind spot in rigid paths drives inevitable mistake, resolved with cost in chrysalis release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: foam observations build density to Conceptual Repricing closure. On-page cost legible in chrysalis tumbling away as Marina releases past rigidity. Orientation anchored immediately at ravine edge; single scene fits defaults seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Braided ravine and foam constrain insight choice, charging final image of "foam patterns below, how they never repeated exactly but rhymed." Sensory hierarchy chemist-specific (helical patterns as polymers). No generic placeholders; lived-in tactile use evolves with grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciliation) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via foam realization narrowing to simple text send. Agency in micro-choices forecloses rigid atonement path with emotional cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise in Elena's response and saved seat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of divergence-to-connection emerges from particulars like foam chains and polymer/music analogies, without statement. Final ravine image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting premise. Organic from conflict; ambiguity in paths lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in symphonic-chemical diction; rhythm modulates from reflective to charged. Text exchanges natural, subtext-driven (Elena's polymer piece mirrors learning). No head-hopping; voice distinct even off-page.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating to closure buzz. Zero loops or scaffolds; metaphors coherent (foam as adaptive chains). Minor density in pattern recurrences taught early, propels without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chemistry-music-nature transforms mother-daughter trope via foam-polymer insight. Risky conceit heightens stakes organically; inevitable in hindsight from Marina's traits. No templates; particular details like blue morpho iridescence distinguish.</comment>
