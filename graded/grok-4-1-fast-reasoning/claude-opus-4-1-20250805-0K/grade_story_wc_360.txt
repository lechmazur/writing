<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied contradictions, as borrowed selves "arguing" in "lucid turbulence," compel printing despite chaos; micro-choices like selecting type under halo influence reveal values. Final alignment earns change with self-loss cost, but math metaphors occasionally abstract emotion from body.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of vanishing stars and layered selves to CR closure: "emotion wasn’t mathematics... typography," reweighting premise with legible cost of original self's erasure in "couldn't remember which personality was originally hers." Single scene, orientation anchored by ~50 words, lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Topaz walls "pulse" and refract vanishing starlight, constraining printing under open roof and charging final constellation of sheets vs. failing stars. Sensory selection (ink shifting colors, halo's "metal and ozone") filters through Mira's printmaker bias, mirroring internal multiplicity without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving selves amid stellar extinction escalates accumulatively via star vanishings and self-arguments, narrowing to endurance in printing; agency in persisting despite "traces" forces trade-off, with cost felt in "seventeen different mouths." One decisive density shift suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transposed selves emerges organically from printing acts, culminating in resonant CR: "everyone was already everyone else, just printed in different fonts," reweighting math premise via typography without moralizing. Ambiguity in messages invites rereading prior layers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of print/math metaphors ("solve for X... emotional derivatives"); rhythmic prose modulates from syncopated press to silent alignment, heightening turbulence without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with metaphors integrated into action ("ink appeared silver... color of forgetting"); varied syntax propels from mechanical "clicked" to chaotic "lucid turbulence," but occasional figurative density in peak self-conflict risks slight overload.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress as empathy-preserver amid cosmic loss transforms tropes into "borrowed selves align into... impossible truth," with risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightening stakes to defiant final star.</comment>
