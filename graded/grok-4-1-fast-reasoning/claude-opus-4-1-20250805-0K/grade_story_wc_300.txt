<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses in hesitation before etching ("professional distance" vs. urge), embodied in trembling hand and gloved finger tracing; final shift earned via causal buildup of confessions mirroring her regrets, with cost in dissolving "armor."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of etched confessions builds to her etching and pearl's eruption as RR/CR closure; cost legible in "shift inside her chest—not breaking, but opening" and weakened walls; orientation anchored early via caves/pedestal/pearl.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystal caves and conch shell constrain choices (etching site) and charge final image (crystals as "constellation," fractures "like veins of hope"); sensory hierarchy via Mara's professional gaze narrows to phosphorescence and scratches.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs. connection) signaled via job/backstory, tightens accumulatively through confessions to her etching (agency foreclosing "professional armor" with embodied cost); pearl glow forces stance crystallization under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of isolation-to-connection emerges organically via particulars (etchings, pearl glow); resonant non-literal close in "phone already dialing" reweights confessions as conversations without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (radiance "breathes," scratches via "gloved finger"); rhythmic modulation peaks in eruption ("erupted, filling the cave") without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; propulsion via strong verbs ("traced," "etched," "erupted") integrates image/action; peak "dissolve like salt in warm water" coherent, voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bunker trope into "cultivation chamber" for emotional growth via pearl/confessions; risk in metaphorical literalism (walls fracture) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
