<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to solve engineering anomalies drives consistent actions like tracing pipes and redirecting flows, revealed through concrete micro-choices. Interiority shows embodied excitement in "rust flaked away," but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; stoic wonder feels told rather than layered with irrationality. Final endurance as navigator earned by prior discoveries, but no deep flaws complicate peak choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of pipe anomalies builds to fountain eruption as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting terminal as "machine for hope" with conceptual cost of hidden genius vs. carnival ephemera. Orientation anchored early in spaceport arrival. Single continuous scene with causal linkages (sextant find → valve work → activation) and legible closure cost in "permanent enchantment."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "confetti littered the cracked terrazzo" and "bronze piece... wedged beneath a loosened floor panel" filter through Maya's engineering bias, constraining choices (blueprints guide tracing). Recurrent fountain evolves from dry to erupting arcs, charging final image and mirroring aspiration. Sensory hierarchy sharpens on tactile rust and water rhythm under urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solve blueprint anomalies) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via sextant discovery tightening options into activation attempt. Agency in "redirecting the flows" forces deepening realization; one meaningful cadence shift suffices. Cost legible in system "groaned, protested," altering tactics with rust and dormancy, charging closure poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of infrastructure encoding human aspiration emerges organically from pipe "junction represented a decision point" to final "equations for hope," with subtext in carnival contrast. Final image of sextant in sunlight offers resonant CR without overt moral, reweighting prior equations. Minor thematic echo in "physics of purpose" borders statement (−0.4), but ambiguity lingers in "maze of intentions."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in engineering diction ("hydraulic brain," "pressure differential"). Rhythm modulates from precise tracing to humming crescendo; no head-hopping or elision. Prose texture distinct in syntax like "Water began to move... groaned, protested, then gradually found its rhythm," confident under rising intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "each stream calculating trajectories" advances plot, theme, atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor paraphrase loops in wonder repetitions ("stoic wonder," "wondrous") dull two beats (−0.4), but no closure touch; syntax propels without monotony or filter stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise transforms spaceport into hydraulic celestial computer for "hope itself"—non-obvious synthesis of engineering and aspiration feels inevitable via pipe encoding. Risk in analog-navigator metaphor heightens stakes without gimmick; fresh inflections like fountain parabolas recharge motifs organically.</comment>
