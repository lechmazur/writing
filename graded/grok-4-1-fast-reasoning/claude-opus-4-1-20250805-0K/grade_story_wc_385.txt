<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Senna's contradictory sorrow and recognition ("bones ache with recognition") drive the singing choice, embodied in rising voice despite "leaving everything behind"; minor epiphanic summary ("understood finally") is hairline slip not touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with progressive disclosures tightening to CR closure ("sang herself into the echo"), cost legible in "leaving only the faintest whisper of melancholy"; one deepening via shell's voices suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nexus constrains singing ("strongest acoustic phenomenon") and charges final shimmer ("walls...instruments"); selective auditory details (harmonics, starlight scales) filter through Senna's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (echo mystery) deepens via shell disclosures under Accumulative lens, agency in final song foreclosing individuality with on-page cost ("sorrow, not joy"); no slips at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of echoes as "conversations across time" emerges organically, final image ("canyon remembered everything") reweights premise without moralizing; counter-reading (refusal option) lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Auditory perceptual signature ("voice split into harmonics") and rhythmic modulation (short urgent sentences at peak) sustain lyric texture; stable limited POV with no elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action (shell "dissolve[s]...becoming sound"); varied rhythm propels to closure, minor opening metaphor density purposeful without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes acoustics and multidimensional chorus into inevitable CR; bold lyric risk (cosmic invitation via song) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
