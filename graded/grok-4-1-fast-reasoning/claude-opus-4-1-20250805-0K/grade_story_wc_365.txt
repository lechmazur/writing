<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's sensory-specific interiority and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., precision in redirects) reveal contradictory impulses between exploration and dawning curse realization, earning the closure shift to mending. Mother's arrival applies relational pressure, forcing stance reconfiguration. Minor abstract summary in mother's explanation slightly dulls embodiment at peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: redirect density builds pattern to nexus RR (joint weaving, shard dissolution as conceptual cost in "vast work ahead"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via deliberate path pull. Closure cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (rust as copper bells, walls breathing fungi) selectively constrain redirects and charge nexus as micro-setting. Shard as recurring object shapes choices and final dissolution. POV bias sharpens urgency; evolution mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find mother/truth) signaled early; accumulative deepening via escalating redirects narrows to nexus revelation, forcing repair renunciation with cost (exile, destruction). Agency in sensory navigation; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of gift-as-curse-to-cure emerges organically from sensory mappings and nexus CR, reweighting exploration via "we map the repairs." Final image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Particulars (threads, patches) avoid abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with sensory perceptual signature; voice modulates rhythmically (synesthetic bursts to crisp dialogue). Mother's harmonics-distorted speech carries subtext; dialogue advances revelation naturally. No head-hopping; diction purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: synesthesia integrates action without overwriting. Rhythm varies (short redirect bursts); no loops or scaffolds. Minor metaphor consistency (ribbons, whispers) supports without muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory multiverse navigation as reality-mender transforms tropes via particular mappings/tears; cyclical shard enables fresh CR payoff. Risky mosaic shards heighten stakes coherently (+0.3). Inevitable in hindsight from early pattern.</comment>
