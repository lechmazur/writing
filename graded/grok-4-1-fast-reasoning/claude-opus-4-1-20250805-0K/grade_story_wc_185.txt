<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via pattern-reading expertise and embodied strain ("joints protesting") earns endurance at closure; motivation rooted in lifelong skill compels ritual under interference. Minimal contradictory impulses limit to very strong band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern density building to Charged Poise RR; closure reconfigures harmony via bloom expansion with legible cost ("maps would need updating," joints ache). Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice crack patterns constrain extraction choice; echo stone and ripple-marks on floor charge final image of shifting geography. Sensory hierarchy (sound/silence, luminescence) reflects her perceptual bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore balance amid beings' cacophony) signaled early; ritual deepens pressure under Accumulative lens, narrowing to bloom success with physical cost. Agency in listening to ice's "architecture" forces reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of harmony needing silence emerges organically from particulars; final smile and "quieter heart" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Recurring patterns shift meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (ripples as maps); prose texture modulates rhythmically with intensity, diction biased to sonic imagery. No head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs; high density integrates action, image, atmosphere without major loops. Purposeful "patterns" motif avoids artifact penalty; minor repetition of ripple imagery purposeful but borders template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic fantasy via hush bloom transforms tropes; risk in lyric Accumulative design heightens stakes through pattern inevitability. Final "hammered repose" feels earned, non-obvious.</comment>
