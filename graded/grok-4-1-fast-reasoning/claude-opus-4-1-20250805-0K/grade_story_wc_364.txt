<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Korin's meekness as "listening" drives forging choices with embodied scars and invitation over demand, earning the blade's creation; merchant applies secondary pressure at close. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in bartering recognition versus confusion. Minor flaw: archetypal blacksmith edges toward stock without deeper flaw complication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered silk-mine forging tightening to merchant's "Recognition flooded his face," delivering CR closure with legible cost of bartered dreams. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene with descent shard coherent. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating stone anvil constrains forging; cherry blossoms "falling upward" charge final image, mirroring defiance. Sensory details (pink snow, silk glow) filter through Korin's priorities, evolving causally. Micro-setting (mine chambers) guides choices without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform exhaustion into awakening blade) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via descent and rhythmic strikes narrowing reality-thin options. Agency in "deliberate reconstruction" forecloses loss with felt time cost in depths. Cost unmistakable in merchant's trembling recognition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bartered awakenings emerge organically from silk threads to blade's "azure defiance," resonant non-literal answer in "falling isn't failure... another form of flight." Complexity lingers without moralizing; final image reweights resilience premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in "metal remembered everything"; diction/rhythm modulate from precise strikes to lyric close. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Cut only what binds"); no head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "silk guided him through darkness"); varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor overwrite in mine scars description borders purple but pattern-taught; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-silk, memory-ore, floating arches transforms tropes into "coax resilience from rubble"; risk in lyric world logic heightens stakes. Final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars, no derivative hedging.</comment>
