<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias's realization that his false genealogies mirror his grandfather's silence, embodied in the chest pressure and micro-choice to place the watch hand, earning the closure renunciation with visible career cost; no diagnostic speak or tidy paths mar pivotal epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as carving discoveries densify into a betrayal map, yielding Conceptual Repricing closure when Elias places the watch hand among accusations, with legible cost of ending his business; orientation anchored in opening line, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Driftwood carvings as micro-setting constrain discovery and charge final image, with tactile fingers on salt-worn wood and dusk's fading light narrowing reflection; sensory hierarchy POV-specific, no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of inherited silence tightens via pattern break of carved boat coordinates, forcing stance crystallization in closure decision under Accumulative lens; agency in sifting and final placement pays cost on-page, though abstract exposure threat lacks one visceral loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth-vs-comfort emerges organically from carvings' accusations reweighting Elias's work, with final watch-hand placement as resonant non-literal answer sans moralizing; complexity lingers in late-comer regret without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature filters driftwood as genealogical clues, with diction modulating from descriptive to charged in realization beats; rhythmic control heightens pressure without filter excess or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via image-packed sentences like "initials worn smooth, dates barely visible"; minor sieve motif repetition purposeful without loops, though occasional elevated phrasing like "bruised purples" borders overwriting in opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Driftwood-map of betrayals transforms genealogist guilt trope into fresh conceptual turn, with risk-taking in solo reflective arc synthesizing profession and inheritance inevitably; no derivative echoes, bold irreplaceability.</comment>
