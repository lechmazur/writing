<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in the injection scene, where tremors and tasted fear reveal character under pressure; motivation to decode memories drives micro-choices like tracing cracks and packing fragments, earning her transformation with conceptual cost. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("helix-minded") slightly abstracts traits without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as perceptual density spirals to CR closure in the dawn emergence, reweighting abandoned dreams as internalized with undeniable conceptual cost ("forever changed, carrying... museum"); orientation anchored early in canyon/sub wreck; single scene with purposeful compression fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting of fractured mirror constrains choices (tracing, decoding) and charges final image (packed fragments as Rosetta stone); canyon pulses tactilely with heartbeat, mirroring internal helix via selective sensory bias; no white-room, vivid integration without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding entangled memories via self-mod) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening reverie/injections narrowing perception to dream-patterns; agency in neural mod forecloses prior self with transformation cost legible in "not quite human, not quite machine."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of fossilized ambitions as helical memories emerges organically from particulars like Fibonacci fractures and catalogued patterns; final image reconfigures premise non-literally, answering human purpose/power via internalized dreams without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in helix/spiral diction biases noticing (e.g., "fracture line mapped to neural pathways"); rhythmic control modulates from moonlit poise to injection intensity; stable third-limited POV with no leakage, purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "first injection sent tremors... tasted metallic fear"); figurative pattern (spirals, helices) coherent and taught, but pervasive metaphors slightly overload injection beat without obscuring closure. Minor helix repetitions purposeful, no loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neural mod accessing object-entangled memories in sub graveyard transforms sci-fi tropes via helix precision; risk-taking in accumulative lyric structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight through patterned particulars.</comment>
