<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied reluctance peaks in "wanted to grip it tighter... loosened his hold," earning the final acceptance with contradictory impulses visible on-page; grandmother's backstory anchors without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as plant observations densify to personal CR in "no longer fully human... necessarily in between," reweighting premise with legible cost of hybrid identity at leaf merge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mossy trellis and glistening leaf constrain touch and charge final recognition moment, with rain droplets and glowing moss filtering through Marcus's nursery bias to mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to understand plants tightens accumulatively via personal changes (green nails to leaf merge), forcing release with felt cost of lost humanity charging the ending walk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of "become with them" emerges organically from merging leaf and final realization without statement, reweighting study premise in resonant CR image of green darkness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (leaf pulsing under thumb, plants breathing) biases noticing toward transformation, with stable close-third distance modulating rhythm under rising density; no dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with short punchy sentences in merge ("Marcus didn't pull away") propelling to closure; minor "transformation" recurrences purposeful for textural lens, no loops dulling image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical metamorphosis as inheritance threshold transforms eco-horror trope through specific nursery details and reluctant release, risking hybrid closure payoff.</comment>
