<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marion's interiority shines in concrete actions like matching musical phrases to film frames, revealing contradictory hope against assumed loss; steely longing embodied in trembling fingers post-climax earns final refuge creation without epiphany dump.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as music-film harmonics build density to RR closure (Sophia steps through, clock lurches to 11:48); cost legible in "eyes carrying the weight of dwelling in between frames," with orientation anchored by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Coral roots and piano hammers constrain choices (resonating harmonics), charging final stars-as-perforations image; sensory hierarchy (compass quivers like birds) filters through Marion's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (summon Sophia) tightens via new film hand and improvised faster playing under accumulative lens, forcing agency with felt cost in magnetic reshaping; one decisive density surge suffices, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of longing-as-creation emerges organically via Sophia's line "they point to where home waits to be built," reweighting compasses without moralizing; final unmapped direction offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (filmic emulsion metaphors); brief dialogue natural/subtextual, voice modulates rhythmically to climax without filter stacks or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propulsion (e.g., "frame by frame, she'd studied them") varies rhythm without loops or muddled metaphors; purposeful lyricism reads aloud with natural cadence, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of film-emulsion refuges and coral-music harmonics transforms lost-love trope; risk in experimental frame-matching pays off inevitably at screen-emergence without gimmick.</comment>
