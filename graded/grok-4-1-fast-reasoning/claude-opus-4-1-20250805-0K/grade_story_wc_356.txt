<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via olfactory sensitivity constraining rushed ambition, with internal conflict dramatized in slow sketching versus mockery; earned change peaks in enduring stench, though minor epiphany phrasing ("she understood then") borders unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build of sketches mirroring village sway to RR closure in bloom and "breathing deeply despite her sensitive nose"; orientation anchored early in Whisperwood arrival; cost legible in final serenity amid chaos.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid treetop setting (rope bridges, suspended garden, dew from webs) constrains tending choices and charges final gathering sway; olfactory hierarchy POV-specific; mirrors internal rooting without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (master flower via patience) signaled early, tightens texturally at sketch breakthrough narrowing rush to embodiment; agency in persistent tending yields bloom cost (stench endurance); coherent pressure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of undercurrent wisdom emerges organically from swaying village/ sketches/ flower transformation, resonant in final image reweighting ambition to "rooted at last"; no moralizing, ambiguity in beauty/terribleness lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with olfactory perceptual signature (smelling dreams, readiness "like thunder"); voice texture lyrical yet controlled, modulating with growth intensity; sparse dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors (sap beneath bark) integrated; minor figurative density in opening ("putrid-sweet promise") risks overwrite but supports botanical voice without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of olfactory herbalism, family sketches on seed paper, and swaying village as wisdom crucible transforms trope of patient growth; corpse flower's "dreams" and stench as communication ingeniously original.</comment>
