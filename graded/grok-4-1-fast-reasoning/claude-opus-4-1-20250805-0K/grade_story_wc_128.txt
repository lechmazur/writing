<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Margot's shrewd traits shine in negotiating shipments, compelling her shift from ledgers to personal delivery; contradictory impulses act in choosing "personal cargo" over forwarding. Minor summary of dock cycles dilutes embodied peak emotion at locket reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building compassion layers across legible shards; CR closure in "tucked the photo beside her ledgers" reconfigures her worldview with conceptual cost of transcending calculations. Multi-shard transitions smooth but months-later jump summarizes escalation without full density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Roofless library frames choices and charges final image under stars, mirroring legacy; sensory details like "breeze carry pages' whispers" filter through Margot's priorities. Breezy harbor anchors early without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of forwarding vs. personal action tightens accumulatively via sibling reveal, forcing trade-off in her "shrewd negotiations"; cost legible in relational walls broken. One deepening suffices but lacks sharper option-narrowing under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cycles emerge organically from locket handoff and library revival, final image reweighting broker's premise without moral; resonance from particulars like nautical charts. Borders thematic echo in "cycles of compassion" phrasing but avoids direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias in noticing manifests and stars; dialogue subtext-rich in Martha's "He kept the library running?" advances revelation. Lyrical rhythm modulates pressure, minor elevation in "tidal certainty."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, density high in action beats; final metaphors purposeful without muddle. Minor paraphrase loop in "work continued... one... time" drags closure image slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Misaddressed locket transforms kindness trope into multi-generational cycle via broker's ingenuity; fresh synthesis of port legacy and estranged siblings. Time-shard risks heighten stakes coherently.</comment>
