<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lila's interiority shines in embodied noticing of anomalies like upward shadows, with contradictory awareness (cursed yet merciful) acting in her planting and following choices; final commitment to seeds earns change via prior guerrilla acts. Elderly woman applies relational pressure, confirming her ministry. Minor slip: epiphany line "not madness but ministry" borders unearned, but anchored in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layers of anomalies (fountain, moths, bread trail) tighten to tea house entry and CR closure where attention frees spirit, with cost in ongoing tending legible in seed-planting resolve. Orientation anchors early (Lila, palace grounds, Tuesdays). Single scene fits scope perfectly; no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Overgrown courtyard and tea house (paper screens, materializing cups) constrain path via hedge gap and bread trail, charging final flickering image; sensory hierarchy (warm rosemary, future rain taste) biases through Lila's gardener lens. Gardens mirror internal shift from secret to sanctuary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (following bread to impossible intrusions) signaled early deepens accumulatively to revelation, narrowing from solitary noticing to communal ministry with agency in acceptance; cost felt in "witness without demanding explanation." One tightening via uncloak suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of attention granting absolution emerges from particulars (bread memories, garden permissions) without statement; final CR reweights noticing as negotiable reality with conceptual cost of persistence. Resonant image of bread tasting forgiveness lingers ambiguously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (reality's "soft edges," "quiet amendments"); diction/rhythm modulate from observational to charged ("universe practiced a heuristic kindness"). Dialogue sparse but subtextual, natural; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punches in uncloak, flowing lists of gardens); purposeful repetition (bread, gardens) propels without loops. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors ("seasons that bent backward") near closure, but doesn't dull image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: guerrilla gardening permissions reality's anomalies transforms magical realism trope organically; risk in lyric noticing-as-ministry heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via bread trail to seeds.</comment>
