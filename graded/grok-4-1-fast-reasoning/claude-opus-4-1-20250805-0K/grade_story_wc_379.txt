<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marta's curator trait drives micro-choices like waiting silently and following to the shelter, earning Elena's change; embodied listening shows contradiction between instinct and action. Minor slip: Elena's voice strengthens too tidily without deeper flaw friction in "Her voice grew stronger with each sentence."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: density builds from locket whisper to courtyard mission control, tightening via letters discovery into Charged Poise closure at "This home." Cost legible in Elena's prior silence reconfigured; two clear shards with legible transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Courtyard and locket constrain choices (neighbor network, final hanging) and charge ending image; sensory details like "sparrows gather breadcrumbs" filter through Marta's calm observation, evolving with events. Recurrent locket as micro-setting mirrors internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlocking Elena's silence signaled early via locket; accumulative escalation via collective deepening forecloses isolation with on-page cost in tears and reclaimed address. Agency in Marta's "Show me" narrows options coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of listening unlocking sealed pain emerges via locket/mailbox particulars, resonating in final courtyard image without statement; counter-reading in eviction intrusion adds ambiguity. "Objects know their stories" line borders overt but ties to closure organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Marta with perceptual signature in object-focus; dialogue natural/subtextual ("We hear you") advances stakes. Rhythm modulates from calm dawn to mission intensity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors like "tears fell like rain after drought" purposeful without muddle in peak. Minor scaffold in repetitive "morning" anchors, but no loops dulling closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thrift curator following object into community healing transforms lost-item trope; risk in multi-neighbor coordination heightens ingenuity without gimmick. Elena's arc from silence feels earned in hindsight.</comment>
