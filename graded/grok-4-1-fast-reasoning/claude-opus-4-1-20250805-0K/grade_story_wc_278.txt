<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's micro-choices (unpacking tools, needling air) reveal values under pressure, with amber as embodied anchor tying gift to task; Dr. Kepler applies secondary pressure via exposition. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak work beat, leaning competent over conflicted. Final endurance (packing with loop knowledge) feels earned but internal conflict light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound density (static to cries to math) builds to RR closure in constellation memorial and "Thank you for remembering us." Orientation anchored instantly in arrival; cost legible in amber crack and future-loop realization. Single scene tightens meaningfully without micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lab amplifies frequencies, constraining Mara's focus via amber lens; meteorite ink and suspended lights as micro-setting charge tattooing choices. Sensory hierarchy (subsonic guilt, warm amber) filters through her perceptual bias. Recurring amber evolves (warmth to crack), mirroring internal shift in final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush firmware cries) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as cries resolve to music/math, forcing deepening via air-tattooing agency. One tightening (ghost realization narrows to memorial path) forecloses deletion cycle with amber-crack cost. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise in pulsing constellation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of guilt-to-acknowledgment emerges organically from deleted code ghosts paralleling amber mosquito's ancient blood-memory. Final constellation image reweights premise non-literally, inviting ambiguity on digital conscience without moralizing. Subtext in crying-to-lullaby shift carries emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (frequencies only she hears); diction/rhythm (humming pendant, meteor hush) modulates poetically under pressure. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("The firmware is haunted"), distinguishing voices. No head-hopping; elisions (future letters) pay off in loop realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer image/action (needles "tethering the ghostly code to points of light"). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful metaphors consistent without muddle. Minor overwriting in sound progression but weaves into momentum without dulling closure silence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes tattooing, firmware ghosts, temporal folds into fresh digital-conscience memorial; transforms haunting trope via code-sediment consciousness. Risky surreal logic (inking air constellations) heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via amber constraint. Bold voice commits fully without retreat.</comment>
