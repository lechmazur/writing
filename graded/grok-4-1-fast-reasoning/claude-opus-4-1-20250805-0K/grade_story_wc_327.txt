<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storyteller's motivation to preserve Thuvenli roots in copper-veined embodiment, shown through patient micro-choices like angling the diamond; interiority concrete via pulsing veins and texture sensations; final transformation earned as endurance with self-sacrifice cost, satisfying 9+ test via contradictory struggle (eluded language) acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from starlings to diamond crack alignment to humming/carving, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) via storyteller's integration and language hybrid; cost legible in "her veins finally cooled" and sealed diamond; orientation anchored early at canyon edge; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bone towers, copper veins, and starlings constrain choices (pressing diamond, matching gaps, carving grooves) and charge final image of canyon's evolved song; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (texture against veins); setting evolves causally with actions, mirroring internal transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve Thuvenli texture) signaled early, tightens texturally via birds' pattern unlocking sensation, forcing hybrid creation; agency in angling/humming forecloses pure preservation; cost unmistakable in language's death and self-integration, charging closure under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transforming loss emerges organically from texture-to-sound hybrid; starlings/diamond shift meaning at end, offering resonant non-literal answer (preservation via reconfiguration) without moralizing; final image reweights premise with conceptual cost of original's extinction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in tactile textures ("dried lavender crumbling"); rhythmic control modulates intensity, compressing under pressure; diction character-specific (texture metaphors via veins); no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "copper veins catching moonlight" advances action/atmosphere/POV); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts/muddle in peak beats like diamond activation; propulsion clear through sensory propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of texture-language, bone echoes, bird-tuned diamond feels inevitable; transforms fantasy tropes via specific copper-vein mechanics; bold risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
