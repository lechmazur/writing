<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya's arthritic signing and ritual clicks embody contradictory isolation/connection impulses, earning the relational shift when Chen signs "This is music," compelling higher-stakes collaboration with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mapping density builds to signing performance; closure as Charged Poise in "silence felt like a beginning rather than an end," with undeniable cost of 40-year loss reconfigured on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Luminous harbor moonlight constrains to visual perception and charges final image as "concert hall" and "spotlight," mirroring internal shift from absence to presence without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating silence tightens accumulatively via Chen's interpretation narrowing solo to shared options; agency in photographing gestures forecloses isolation with relational fulfillment cost legible in dawn realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-visual-symphony emerges organically from mapping/gestures, resonant non-literal answer in final signing exchange reweighting loss/retention without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable Maya-limited POV with lyrical perceptual signature (framing silence via viewfinder); signing "dialogue" carries natural subtext and distinction, modulating rhythm under emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (e.g., short click beats amid lyrical flows); purposeful "click" repetition propels without loops, clear propulsion to closure image unscathed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deaf composer reversing sign-to-music via empty-camera silence-mapping feels inevitable; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
