<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in exhaustion vs. conducting push, earning the "chronologically home" renunciation with embodied bone-frequencies cost; nautilus mapping reveals particular temporal flaws driving climax agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from fortune-spreading to swirl, landing Charged Poise closure; "exhaustion creeping through her bones" makes cost legible in final crescendo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass spire and frozen lake constrain temporal perception, with mirrored horizon folding to charge closure image; nautilus micro-setting pulses rhythm constraining the symphonic peak.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant homesickness stake escalates accumulatively via mapping-to-conducting cadence shift under exhaustion pressure; "before her body would demand sleep" tightens to foreclose ordinary dreaming with reconfiguration cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Spiral-time theme emerges organically from fortune-notes and memory-mapping, resolved non-literally in "conducted them all" image reweighting prior particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with temporal syntax and musical rhythm signatures Mei's perceptual bias; pattern-taught compression holds stable POV distance through climax swirl without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Purposeful spiral repetition teaches pattern without loops, high density in sensory images propels momentum; minor figurative density in reflections doesn't dull closure swirl.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nautilus-fortune-symphony synthesis transforms time-trope into inevitable lyric risk, heightening stakes via experimental Accumulative closure without gimmickry.</comment>
