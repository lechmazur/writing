<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margaret's chronic curiosity and folklorist traits compel her to cross-reference constellations and reach into the ring, earning the closure change with a "mind heavy with recovered histories" cost; interiority embodied in "thrill of discovery" amid Gran's dark memories shows contradiction without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern detection (broken constellations to ring) tightens knowledge toward DC at "She reached into the ring, and the memories flowed," with legible cost in the dimming ring and heavy mind reconfiguring her role; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse with "squelched beneath her boots," barnacles, and shipwrecks constrains navigation and charges closure as "sentinels in the morning mist"; sensory hierarchy (phosphorescence, salt-thick air) mirrors discovery urgency through folklorist bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover memories) signaled early tightens via deepening at floating memories revealing Gran's sacrifices, forcing stance crystallization; agency in placing mushroom and reaching shows cost in shuddering greenhouse and "mind heavy," coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserving painful stories emerges organically from particulars like "constellation maps that break" and absorbed fragments, resonant in final image of whole maps guiding others without moralizing; counter-reading (forgetting as mercy) lingers via dark memories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (pattern-spotting: "detected the pattern now") biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from crisp exploration to charged closure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action with images like "memories floating like jellyfish"; varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds, minor telling in folklore block acceptable under BRR as it anchors present choices.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fairy rings as memory-harvesters via broken constellations and shipwreck monuments transforms folklore trope; risk in conceptual CR (backup repository realization) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
