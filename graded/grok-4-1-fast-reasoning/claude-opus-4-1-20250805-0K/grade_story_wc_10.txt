<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied emotions peak in frozen tears on cheeks, revealing grief amid wonder; contradictory impulses of loss and discovery act in scene via experiments; final realization earned by prior thermal mappings with visible cost of isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with deepening thermal discoveries reweighting silence; CR closure in "hadn't lost music at all" with cost legible in crew memory and frozen tears; constraint of deafness shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Winterglass and thermal imaging constrain experiments and charge final plant "symphony" image; aurora as sound waves mirrors internal shift purposefully; selective sensory filter (vibrations, heat) reflects deaf POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Textural escalation via intensifying heat patterns forces deepening stake of translation; agency in fork experiments forecloses auditory loss path with felt endurance cost; dominant stake signaled early and converges cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of thermal "symphony" offers resonant non-literal answer to silence-as-loss, reweighting premise via plant spirits callback; subtext emerges organically from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature of thermal-as-music; diction/rhythm modulates reflective intensity, e.g., "golden warmth spread like ripples"; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines in thermal descriptions; purposeful music/heat motif repetition builds texture without muddle; minor paraphrase loop in plant response patterns ("flared crimson," "pulsed blue-white") slightly dulls mid-density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thermal imaging as plant music transforms disability trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes of silence; final CR feels inevitable from early frost vine response.</comment>
