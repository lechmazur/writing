<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's motivation roots deeply in embodied memories (hum in sternum, brittle bones), with contradictory isolation yielding to earned coexistence; final choice to set down sundial forecloses recreating past with visible cost. Interiority particularizes without labels; Marcus applies light pressure. 9+ test met: impulses act in reflection, realization earned by hum's build.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflections and resonances tightens to CR closure in sundial's shadow, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of paradox. Anchored immediately (library, memories); no orientation debt. Persistent constraint: hum narrows to purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass floor, clouds below, stone circle constrain perception and charge final image (circle glows, library breathes); POV bias filters via memories. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under hum's urgency. 9+ test: recurring objects (sundial, circle) charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation to independence) signaled early, deepens via hum calling tribe to Charged Poise; agency in realization forecloses isolation path. Accumulative escalation: cadence shift reweights with paradox cost in shadow image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of coexistence emerges from particulars (mammoths' harmony, sundial refraction); final image non-literally answers without moral. Resonance from irony of extinct wisdom in modern bodies. 9+ test: reweights prior material (brittle to diamond).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature memory-biased; diction/rhythm modulate with hum's intensity. Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (Marcus affirms). 9+ test: signature holds under pressure, no slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels; metaphors cohere (ice to water, coal to diamond) without muddle in peak (sundial warms). No loops/artifacts; final line recharges motifs. 9+ test: zero issues, propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Reincarnated anachronisms in tidal library synthesize fresh paradox; risk of lyric accumulation heightens stakes via impossible sundial. Transformation inevitable in shadow image; no derivatives.</comment>
