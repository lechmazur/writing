<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's luminous skepticism drives consistent anomaly-tracking choices, earning his transformation to "realistically imaginative" endurance with the woman pressuring via revelation; internal conflict subtle in pursuit vs. cosmic scale.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds anomaly density to CR closure in feather ritual and final box image, reweighting premise with Marcus's lingering transformation cost; orientation anchored early at arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fountains as viscous time constrain ritual choices, evolving from dry basins to flowing song charging closure image; sensory selectivity (e.g., "temporal residue") mirrors POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unsticking memories deepens via feather's accumulative release across fountains, foreclosing frozen history with Marcus's on-page endurance cost; pressure coheres texturally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of patience-fertilized memory emerges organically from ritual particulars, answered non-literally by "fountains sang in defiant hush" reweighting skepticism/wonder without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with skeptic-biased noticing (e.g., "breadcrumbs of anomalies"); sparse dialogue carries subtext like "You're early," rhythm modulates surreal intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied lyrical syntax; patterned "defiant hush" repetition fits voice without loop drag, though minor figurative density risks overwrite in ritual beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of frozen geese, time-fountains, and memory-feather transforms cosmic tropes into inevitable "composting" CR; bold imagery risks heighten stakes organically.</comment>
