<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's acoustic gift and motivation to revive music root choices like tentative notes escalating to sustained play, with embodied emotion in the violin's warmth and final smile signaling earned understanding of grandmother's lesson. Internal conflict subtle—testing vs. forcing notes—but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak scene. Micro-choices reveal values under emerging pressure from gathering musicians.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: note ripples build density, pattern of hush breaks into new harmonies, closure as Conceptual Repricing when Mara smiles understanding "perfect incompletion," reweighting loss with undeniable conceptual cost of transformation. Single continuous scene oriented early via ash-dusted doors and post-fire context. One tightening via musicians' arrival suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse, seawater, shipwrecks constrain acoustics, enabling Mara's perception and charging closure image of moon through broken roof. Sensory details (brine, rusted hulls reflecting light) selective via POV bias toward sound spaces. Environment mirrors internal shift from hush to emergence through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to transform chronic hush signaled early; Accumulative escalation via density of drawn musicians and imperfect play narrows to new, incomplete music with felt cost of lost forest/polished past. Protagonist agency in initiating/sustaining notes forces crystallization; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in unfinished emerges organically from particulars like warped flute, damaged accordion, shifting to "magnificent simplicity of survival." Final image of lowered violin offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting premise without moralizing. Complexity embraced in honest imperfection over restoration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in acoustic focus ("melodies in spaces between sounds"); rhythmic prose modulates with emotional build. Stable single POV, no head-hopping; diction controlled, lyrical without opacity. Voice reflects Mara's perceptive mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer sound, setting, action without loops or scaffolds. Rhythmic variety in note descriptions accelerates emergence; zero figurative muddle, vivid specificity like "wheezed through damaged reeds."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-disaster acoustic rebirth in shipwreck-ringed greenhouse transforms loss tropes via specific perceptual gift and communal unfinished music. Risky lyric build pays off in inevitable-feeling CR closure; no derivative echoes.</comment>
