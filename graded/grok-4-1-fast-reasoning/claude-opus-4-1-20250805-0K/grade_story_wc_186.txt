<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in stubborn tending versus dead world resolve in earned rekindling choice with tears as embodied cost; micro-choices like aligning prism reveal values hierarchy. Interiority particular via retrocognitive pulls. No safety-hedging in her blind persistence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: harmonic densities build to RR closure in beacon's anti-light pulse with 17-year cost legible in "fingers that remembered tomorrow." Orientation anchored early in pavilion/ruins. One tightening via shard's sideways vision suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass pavilion's humming constrains via felt harmonics and shifts song at climax, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (vibrations over visuals) reflects Mira's bias. Pavilion dome fragments light into whispers, mirroring internal shift. Recurrent prism/prism-shadows evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle via silence) signaled early, tightens via shard-prism fusion narrowing to alignment under Accum lens; agency in rotating prism forecloses failure path with years' cost felt in tears. Coherent pressure culminates in ship trace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of coincidences as "conspiracies of light" emerges organically from shard's precise landing and vision; final image of thistle seeds reweights isolation to convergence without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like displaced Aurelius.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with harmonic diction/perceptual signature (frequencies, voids) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from lonely hum to chord crescendo. Compression purposeful and taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short peaks in "shadows that fell upward"); high density integrates action/image without loops or scaffolds. Minor fig density in opening but purposeful payoff at beacon eruption; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of anti-light beacon, hush-shard, sideways retrocog transforms post-apoc tropes; "structured darkness" cuts cosmic noise inevitably from priors. Bold risk in silence-as-signal heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
