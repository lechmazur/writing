<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Edgar's interiority particularized through sense-triggered memories like "smell of hot vacuum tubes," revealing contradictory impulses of isolation and provision that earn the closure realization; her indirect pressure via glimpsed actions amplifies his stakes without headcount issues.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations densify to revelation ("she was holding a reel-to-reel tape player"), delivering on-page Conceptual Repricing at "becoming visible wasn't about emerging... about trust" with felt cost of prior isolation; orientation anchored early via crawl space and dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crawl space pipes constrain movement and gifting ("lowered it on a length of twine"), charging final image of vent grate and amber rectangles; sensory details like "coolness fade" and "dust motes" filter through Edgar's tactile priorities without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hidden guardianship tightens via mutual preservation revelation, narrowing isolation options with agency in gifting and planned handover; outage forces micro-choice of light drop, escalating under Accumulative lens with legible relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory preservation as trust emerges organically via exchanged gifts and tapes, resonant in final non-literal reconfiguration ("careful exchange of gifts"); no moralizing, ambiguity in her awareness lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature in "sense memory" diction and biased noticing of her "purpose"; minimal dialogue natural and subtextual ("I know you're there"), advancing revelation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like tape fragment triggering action/memory; rhythm varies (short gasps amid longer reflections), no loops or artifacts dulling closure image of tightened hand on fragment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library ghost as tape-hoarding collaborator transforms hidden-dweller trope via pipe-cache mechanics and mutual rescue; risk in quiet CR closure heightens emotional specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
