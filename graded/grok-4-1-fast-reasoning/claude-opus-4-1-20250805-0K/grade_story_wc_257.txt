<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's contradictory impulses peak in hesitating to tattoo ("couldn't bring herself... Not yet") while folding cranes and sharing with visitor, earning poised endurance at closure with relational cost via given pendant and crane; backstory anchors tilt present choices without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density (phoenix, cranes, candles) tightening to Charged Poise CR in final needle-press and crane-left, reconfiguring grief-hope with conceptual cost of "refined by fire"; immediate observatory anchor passes orientation cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Timeless observatory dome/stars constrain timing and refuge (no clocks, beacon light draws visitor) while charging closure glow; candle constellation and vellum integrate tactilely through Elena's jeweler actions, mirroring internal shift without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transformation stake signaled early deepens accumulatively via visitor mirroring Elena's grief, forcing crane-gift trade-off with embodied cost ("foreign" smile) that narrows to final poised crane for next soul; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emergent theme of refined rebirth reweights via phoenix-crane reprise, answered non-literally in final "genuinely artificial and absolutely true" image without moralizing; woman's "burn without dying" implies subtext through interaction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close-third POV stable with transformation-biased perception (stars wheeling, light beacons); dialogue natural/subtextual ("What would you like it to become?"), voice rhythm modulates from meditative to companionable without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dense propulsion in lines like "silver wire coiling beneath steady hands that had once trembled," varying rhythm accelerates visitor beat to closure glow; zero loops, purposeful figures (phoenix perfection) without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh observatory-memorialist frame transforms grief tropes via coordinate-cranes and vellum phoenix; risk in lyric accumulative closure heightens stakes through irreplaceable "genuinely artificial" design constraint.</comment>
