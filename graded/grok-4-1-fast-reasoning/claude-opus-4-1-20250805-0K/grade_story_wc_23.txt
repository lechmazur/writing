<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—personal longing versus duty—act simultaneously in the brother call, earning her final renunciation with embodied cost in shaking arms and scarred hands; no stock phrasing, traits shown through micro-choices like leveraging the censer foot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as call density and physical cranking build to Charged Poise closure in the dawn release of the bronze foot, reconfiguring her stance with legible cost (scratches, separation); orientation anchors immediately in station and role, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bronze censer foot as micro-setting constrains choices (lever, brace) and charges final image; sensory details (scraping, warmth) selective through POV urgency, world rules (toxins, drones) consistent via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide migrants despite weakness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via weakening moon phase and brother call forcing personal trade-off; cost unmistakable in physical strain and "some of us are meant to stay."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of duty amid loss emerges organically from guidance calls and final image refusing migration, offering resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; brother's plea reweights particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (maps in dirt, constellation guidance); dialogue natural/subtextual (child's stars, brother's whisper), advances stakes; rhythmic control heightens under strain.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with no loops/artifacts, varied rhythm propels (short calls amid cranking); specific diction (patina bronze, sulfur fields) over generics, clarity peaks in closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reverse migration premise transformed via word-built paths and censer-lever ingenuity; risk in cryptic guidance heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
