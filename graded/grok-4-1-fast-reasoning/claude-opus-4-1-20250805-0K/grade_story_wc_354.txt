<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Viktor's tension between Academy return and nexus wisdom, embodied via thumb on worry stone; final renunciation to stay earned by game pressures. Mira applies relational crucible without archetype slip. Father's whisper anchors generational flaw productively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density of magnetic/chess silences tightens to CR closure where exile reconfigures as gift, cost legible in forgoing Academy ("I stay, not because I can't return"). Single scene anchored early (~50 words); no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus constrains choices (pieces slide via field) and charges final image (aurora correlating with board harmony). Twilight progression to stars mirrors internal deepening; tactile board (magnetite/quartz) reflects POV priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (return post-covenant?) signaled early, accumulatively tightens via Mira's arrival/game to agency-driven stasis (stay), cost felt in passed stone/foreclosed path. One deepening via "impossible position" forces stance; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in difficulty emerges via particulars (impossible board position singing harmony), resonant CR in "exile as gift" without moralizing. Final aurora/stone image reweights premise organically; subtext in Mira's queen threat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable 3rd-limited Viktor with perceptual signature (correlating patterns); dialogue subtextual ("Will you leave us?") pursues goals. Rhythmic control modulates melancholy to poise; no head-hopping, distinct voices (Mira direct, Viktor reflective).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy game lines amid lyric swells); no loops, purposeful metaphors (pieces leaning magnetic north) propel without muddle. Propulsion peaks clean in closure stone pass.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess-magnetic nexus transforms exile trope via correlated patterns; risk in "impossible" board harmony inevitable from setup. Bold non-causal accumulative closure heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
