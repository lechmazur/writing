<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Implants embody skepticism as flickering doubt resolving to aurora green, with contradictory impulses in slowed glow versus tasting evidence; final weather formation earned by genetic awakening without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory density (tastes, pulses) builds to CR closure in fog emergence, with legible cost in worldview forfeiture; oriented early via Alaskan bluff and aurora.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ring and bluff constrain sensing and convergence, charging final image; sensory tastes (copper-north to iron-ozone) filter via Marina's bias, evolving with election pulse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Skepticism stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via arrivals and implant strobe, forcing acceptance agency; cost legible in blazing-then-shifting implants, though Simon's arrival borders convenience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of humans as planetary regulators emerges via particulars like fractal bark and fog, resonating in final image; docked for Simon's thesis articulation ("We are weather") echoing premise too directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with synesthetic perceptual signature (taste-flavors as directions); minimal dialogue natural and goal-pursuing, voice modulating rhythmically from doubt to electric harmony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density integrates action, sense, and image without loops; minor figurative density in tasting recurrences purposeful and pattern-taught, propelling to aurora-charged close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Terrestrially cosmic premise (tree elections, taste-compass) synthesizes ecology, quantum tech, and inheritance into inevitable CR; bold risks like mycelial democracy heighten stakes organically.</comment>
