<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular via oracle's contradictory truths embodied in fever and trembling hands; drawing/smudging earned by prior marginal discoveries, foreclosing official report with felt cost of carried secrecy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as illustration→logs→aurora density tightens stake; Charged Poise closure in taped drawing reconfigures her role with legible cost of "second, wiser heart."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station instruments constrain calibration choice; aurora light charges final taped image, with alpine specifics like prayer flags filtering through oracle bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to weigh swallowed truth escalates accumulatively via pattern-deepening to aurora bloom; agency in staying/searching/drawing forecloses singular report path, cost felt in embodied weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Margins theme emerges organically from hidden illustrations to her addition; final smudged drawing offers resonant reweighting of certainties without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("truths swaying like prayer flags") biases noticing; rhythmic modulation under aurora pressure consistent, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "truth" recurrence propels without loops; metaphors cohere in peak aurora beat, read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle gift with magnetic flowers transforms isolation trope; risk in lyric abstraction heightens closure's inevitability.</comment>
