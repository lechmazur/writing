<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses—evading Torven yet softening at his vulnerability—act in scene, earning the unwrapping climax with embodied cost of shedding disguise. Torven's quick vulnerability fits the Pacified world without unearned leap. Final choice forecloses dock life visibly on rocks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scrimshaw warmth to whale vibration density tightens toward CR closure where island "becomes" via authenticity, cost legible in abandoned clothes. Two shards transition cleanly via nightfall; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe constrains climax call and mirrors internal shallow/deep divide; kelp, glowing surf charge final dive image. Sensory hierarchy (bone vibration through water) reflects dock urgency; no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (authenticity to reach Cetacea) signaled in dream recognition; whale intensification deepens via agency (unwrapping), narrowing to wade with relational cost. Escalation accumulates texturally to Charged Poise in surf.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image—diving as island solidifies via collective authenticity—resonantly reweights Pacification premise from external to internal, without moral state. Particulars (bindings, scrimshaw pulse) build complexity organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in water fluidity metaphors biases noticing (tide slip, kelp sway); dialogue subtext-laden ("My waters" to "magnificent" recognition). Stable close-third with rhythmic modulation under song pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image ("scrimshaw grew hot... began glowing") with propulsion; varied syntax/paragraphs breathe with whale intensification. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms violence-free world into internal authenticity quest, synthesizing scrimshaw/island/whale into inevitable CR; bold gender fluidity risk heightens without gimmick, fresh post-Pacification tenderness.</comment>
