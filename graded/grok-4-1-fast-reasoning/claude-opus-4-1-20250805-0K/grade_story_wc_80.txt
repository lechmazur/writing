<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait embodied concretely when composure cracks in ladies' parlor, revealing grandmother's humming scales; micro-choices like sealing bottle earn final renunciation of grand gestures for small preservations, with felt solitude cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of rituals and absences building to Charged Poise closure in northeast corner sealing; orientation anchored early (surveyor on flooded island post-drawbridge); cost legible in "whispered words that would never appear in his official report."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion constrains wading and tide-forced exit, barnacles/seaweed tactile via hands-on columns; chandelier crystals charge grandmother memory, mirroring internal loosening; recurring inkwell as micro-setting enables documentation ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve dreams vs. tide/demolition) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pavilion shift and turning tide narrowing time; agency in bottle-sealing forecloses demolition path with conceptual cost of "encrypted in glass and stone."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interlaced absence emerges organically from empty seats/music ghosts to final ripples, reweighting preservation premise without statement; resonant non-literal answer in "carrying the weight of witnessed absence," tying surveyor arc to drowned world honor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with surveyor's perceptual bias (grooves, subsidence angles); rhythmic prose modulates from hushed cataloging to charged whisper; diction particular (verdigris, oilcloth) reflects stoic sensitivity without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density in purposeful figures like "pale fingers" and "funeral bunting" without muddle; rhythm varies (short creak sentences amid longer rituals); no loops, propulsion peaks in "click echoing in the hushed blaze."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveyor-as-dream-archeologist transforms flood trope via notes-in-walls ritual; risk in quiet lyric closure heightens stakes of absence preservation without gimmick.</comment>
