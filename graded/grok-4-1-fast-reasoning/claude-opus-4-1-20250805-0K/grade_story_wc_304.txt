<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's progression from beautician to mortician-beautician hybrid compellingly motivates her preservative work, with micro-choices like tracing symbols revealing values under pressure. Internal conflict is implied but not vividly contradictory in the infusion beat. Earned change in creating the threshold feels character-bound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from preparation to pattern alignment, delivering Charged Poise closure in the "pocket of eternal almostness" with conceptual cost of suspended states legible in the final image. Orientation anchors early in skyborne grotto. One tightening via Silence's creep narrows options without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora light hides deliberate movements, constraining actions and charging the final cathedral image; selective sensory details (pulsing chip, frozen fractals) mirror internal states through POV bias. Micro-setting of solidified aurora table integrates purposefully without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving the spark signals early and tightens accumulatively as Silence pulls at feet, forcing infusion agency with felt cost in trembling grotto. Escalation coheres under lens via creeping tide, though no internal-external weave.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in the "radiant hush between the last heartbeat and the first silence" emerges organically from particulars like chip infusion, reweighting premise in star's eyes opening without moralizing. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in "patterns in the static"; rhythmic prose modulates from watchful calm to urgent weave, heightening pressure. Whisper to star carries subtext without dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("emerald chip began to sing—a sound like light given voice"); rhythmic variety and zero loops/scaffolds propel to closure image. Figuratives consistent and voice-motivated, passing ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Silence as crystallizing death and beautician-mortician preserving stellar threshold transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes, with "eternal almostness" inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
