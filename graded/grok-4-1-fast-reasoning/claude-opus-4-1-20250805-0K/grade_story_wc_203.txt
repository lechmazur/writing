<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation roots in trauma and grandmother's gift, compelling micro-choices like dust analysis and ceiling climb; interiority concrete via mechanical lens on ghosts. Final commitment to reporters earned by revelation cascade, with embodied cost in "weightless burden." Minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust → journal → ceiling journals tighten knowledge, reweighting corruption web. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration via ghosts fading and mainspring wind, cost legible in "weightless burden" and vigil's end. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dust patterns constrain choice (rectangle → floorboard), ceiling hides payoff; POV filters via mechanic eye ("cables singing"). Recurrent dust/light charges final "cracks showed clearly." Sensory selective (buzz to silence pivots ghost sighting).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover ceilings' secrets) signaled early, deepens via personal grandmother tie; agency in analysis/pry/climb forecloses ignorance. Accumulative density raises cost (guilt network revealed). One tightening sufficient, charges final action without agency slip.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fixable breaks emerges via mechanical ghosts, sabotaged spring; final wind reconfigures "every broken thing could still be fixed" non-literally. No moralizing; irony in Teresa's guilt shifts meaning. Resonant without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with mechanic perceptual signature ("dust accumulation patterns," "cables singing"); rhythm modulates (short urgent sentences at revelations). Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("You weren't selling tickets"). No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "yellow as old teeth" evokes decay/atmosphere). Varied rhythm propels (buzz-silence pivot); metaphors coherent/mechanic (dying wasp). Zero loops/artifacts; peak clarity at journal cascade.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ghosts-at-failures + inspector bribes fresh synthesis; mainspring as sabotage token transforms ghost trope organically. Risk in quiet Accumulative closure pays off via "whispered promise." No derivatives; inevitable hindsight.</comment>
