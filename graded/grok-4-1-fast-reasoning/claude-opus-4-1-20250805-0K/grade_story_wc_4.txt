<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to complete the spiral is rooted in her archivist gift and intensifies credibly to high-stakes exhibition planning; interiority concrete via "traced the photographs' timeline as vines climb." Minor deduction for idealized calm without shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal beat, like the council deadline pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: photo arcs build density to spiral realization and communal recreation as Charged Poise closure with generational cost legible in "transmute inherited pain into beauty." Orientation anchored early via map case find; one tightening at final photo suffices, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rusted factory bones and lavender field constrain choices (recreation site) and charge final spiral image; sensory selection (purple blooms vs soot, dawn light) mirrors softening via POV bias. Micro-setting of dove gray case as recurring anchor evolves tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve vs erasure) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via timeline density to exhibition agency; council deadline forecloses options with felt urgency. Cost legible in rushed planning, though no on-page reversal beyond pattern break.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of resilience via bodies-as-art emerges organically from photo arcs to spiral payoff; final image non-literally answers "machines cannot make" with communal weaving, reweighting grief without moralizing. Subtext in arcs motif charges closure subtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature ("stories that objects whispered"); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates urgency purposefully. No dialogue; free indirect clean, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short final sentences propel); density high but figurative language in most descriptive beats (e.g., "brushstrokes against purple canvas") borders overwriting without full pattern payoff, dulling peak slightly. No loops; minor scaffold in repeated "arcs" purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise transforms factory ruins into human-spiral art fresh via photo-map ingenuity; risk of communal whimsy pays off in closure without gimmick. Transformation test passes: irreplaceable spiral synthesis inevitable from particulars.</comment>
