<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's interiority shines in embodied sensory details like fingertips tasting temperature variations and the fossil warming against her chest, rooting motivation in her role as last map maker. Micro-choices under pressure, like adjusting the harness to float closer, reveal values with escalating commitment. Minor lack of shown contradictory impulses slightly tempers; realization at fossil crumbling feels earned but smoother than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: emotional layers densify from human traces to alien pulse, tightening via deeper drift into non-human signature. Orientation anchored early in cave with fossil and harness. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in deepest chamber with fossil's crumble as felt cost, reweighting her purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Coastal cave network vividly constrains via tide-breathing passages and electromagnetic suspension, enabling float deeper while limestone absorbs/releases thermal emotions. Bioluminescent constellations and sensory hierarchy (heat-glow amber joy) filter through Kira's bias, charging final alien pulse. Micro-setting of harness and fossil as recurring tools heighten closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to map emotional residue escalates accumulatively: human layers yield to pulsing non-human colors, deepening knowledge and narrowing to translator role. Agency in floating closer and mapping tests commitment, with fossil crumble as visible cost foreclosing solo bridge. One decisive intensification suffices, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transitional bridges emerges organically from fossil/pods/harness paralleling human-other evolution, reweighted in final mapping realization without statement. Resonant non-literal answer in "maps of tomorrow's emotions" invites ambiguity on consciousness convergence. Particulars like crumbling leaf avoid platitudes, tying arc to thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with distinct perceptual signature: heat/temperature obsession biases noticing (veins traced, skin painted in waves). Lyrical rhythm modulates with intensity, compression purposeful in sensory bursts. No head-hopping; voice specificity elevates under discovery pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels: varied syntax/rhythm (short sensory bursts amid fluid drifts) aligns with floating poise, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language like "breathed with each tide" consistent and taught early, avoiding muddle in peak alien encounter. Zero artifacts dull closure; info multi-tasks seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-hibernation sensory sci-fi with "factually mystical" thermal emotions births alien entity from dreams+Earth thoughts. Risky lyric accumulation transforms tropes via lived cave mapping; fossil's crumble feels inevitable. Bold premise commits fully, no hedging or templates.</comment>
