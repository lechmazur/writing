<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation and interiority shine through concrete actions like catching the feather and reframing the kite, earning her final poem; warmly attentive trait enables boy interaction. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under kite-snap pressure, keeping it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from feather to kite snap (pattern break) tightening stake of imperfection; on-page Charged Poise closure in dawn image and poem reconfigures meaning with felt acceptance cost. Orientation anchored early in lagoon details; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lagoon micro-setting (mangroves, tidepool, wind) constrains choices like walking to kite and charges final gold-water image mirroring internal harmony. Sensory details selective via Mira's poetic bias, evolving post-storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in incomplete) signaled early, tightens via kite snap forcing agency in reframing; cost legible in boy's frozen loss and her tending trade-off. Mild stakes scale under Accumulative lens limits peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of broken beauty emerges organically from feather/kite particulars, final image resonantly reweights without literal moral; subtext in boy's face reading. Closing quote ("Morning is not...") borders explicit echo, docking from 9-band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature in poetic noticing (e.g., "symphonies in seaweed tangles"); rhythm modulates beautifully under pressure. Minimal dialogue natural, subtext-driven; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; metaphors (iridescent feather, hammered gold) purposeful without muddle or loops. Minor early figurative density fits taught lyric pattern, no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poet's liminal tending with kite/feather breakage transforms imperfection trope organically. Risky lyric compression heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
