<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marcus's glazier-specific perception of stress fractures and ripples grounds motivation and interiority holistically; final endurance against demolition feels earned through embodied observation. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from stone ripples to dawn light tightening insight; CR closure lands cleanly in "surfaces weren't barriers but birthplaces of possibility" with legible conceptual cost of atrium's loss. Orientation anchored early; single scene fits defaults without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism atrium's geometry and mist constrain ripple patterns and charge final gilded image, filtering through Marcus's priorities; sensory evolution from pre-dawn glow to sun-flood mirrors internal shift purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of illuminating mundane escalates accumulatively via deepening interference nodes and light spectra, narrowing to documentation choice before demolition; agency in repeated stone throws forecloses ignorance with felt loss, though external pressure remains off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries as possibilities emerges organically from ripple intersections and glasswork; final image reconfigures premise without moralizing, inviting ambiguity in endings as illuminations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature biases toward light-bending and patterns, with rhythmic modulation building to charged poise; stable close third-person POV suits reflective aims without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density propels via integrated sensory action, but figurative density peaks overwritingly in "each wave became a moving prism," risking minor coherence drag without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh glazier lens on ripple "language" transforms mundane demolition into noctilucent insight; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
