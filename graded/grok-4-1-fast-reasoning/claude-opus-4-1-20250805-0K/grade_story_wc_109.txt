<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority and embodied endurance in closing the booklet and descending with stiff joints, earning final stasis; obsession shown via 7-year vigil constrains choices effectively. Minor flaw: realization paragraph smooths contradictory impulses ("obsession... precipice" to patience) without on-page friction acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to on-page Conceptual Repricing closure ("the endless night... a process, each dimming a lesson"), with felt cost of patience legible in smile and "excruciating, beautiful patience"; orientation anchored early in parapet/star setup; single scene coherent, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fort's isolation and storm constrain vigil (chosen "precisely for its isolation"), charging final descent as fort "groaned... battered by winds"; body as micro-setting (stiff joints) limits movement; sensory hierarchy (waves/flicker prioritized) reflects POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map endless night) signaled early, tightens texturally via star flicker/non-death reweighting options to patience/endurance; agency in summoning hush forces stance crystallization with conceptual cost; one deepening sufficient under Accum lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of absence's language emerges organically from silence/maps, resonant non-literal answer in final image ("another page waited") reweighting obsession as process without moralizing; complexity lingers in "letting go" ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (noticing "spaces between... pulses") biases toward silence geometries; rhythmic modulation heightens hush texture; stable close-third POV, purposeful compression legible under Accum lens, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax mirroring hush/slow time; purposeful hush repetitions teach pattern without loop; minor figurative density ("resin... honey") in observation beat borders overwriting but supports tone without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms stargazing via "language of absence" and silence grammar; risk-taking in lyric hush pattern heightens stakes organically; irreplaceable pebble-shore framing feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
