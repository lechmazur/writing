<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular via synesthetic emotions like "joy that tasted purple"; cheerful gloom as contradictory impulse acts throughout, earning final renunciation of pure loss via sprouts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fragments builds to CR closure in sprout image reweighting path-loss premise with cost of endless work; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cave's pulsing walls and dimming force exit before "her own memories began to blur," constraining choice; final sprouts in cracks charge closure image, mirroring shift from loss to growth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths disappear) signaled early, tightens via glass emotions to sprout cadence shift narrowing to acceptance; felt cost of unfinished work legible in "bright melancholy."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of paths as transforming seeds emerges implicitly; final sprout/kneel offers resonant reweighting without moral, countering initial conjectures organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with synesthetic perceptual signature ("sorrow that hummed at precisely middle C") stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from humming to singing closure without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors (foam/seeds) without muddle; minor figural density in conjectures contained, propels to humming glass payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory archaeology via emotion fossils transforms loss trope; sprout realization risks bold CR, inevitable from seed motif without gimmick.</comment>
