<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization excels in embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, like weighing the glass to trigger memories and glow; grandfather's legacy roots motivation with earned change to sharing. Final teaching moment reveals values hierarchy with visible cost of time invested. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in patient struggle vs. urgent fog.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from polishing to grotto amplification to beacon; orientation anchored early in descent. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in final distribution image, reweighting guidance premise with patience cost legible in "worn away its rough edges."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto mist and limestone constrain choices, serving as canvas that amplifies glass light and enables beacon. Recurrent sea glass charges final image; sensory details (salt-slick steps, swirling mist) filter through astronomer's bias, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of guiding ships tightens accumulatively via glow discovery narrowing to beacon creation; agency in angling glass forecloses traditional lighthouse path. Cost felt in polishing patience; boats' adjustment shows escalation without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of soft, shared light emerges organically from particulars like mist prisms and glass polishing, reweighting "Stars live in more places" in communal ending. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; ambiguity in "tender persistence" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature in phrases like "liquid starlight"; voice modulates rhythmically from introspective to triumphant. Brief dialogue natural, goal-driven ("Teach us"); no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose propels with varied rhythm and high density, metaphors integrated like "breaching whales" without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; final line recharges motifs cleanly. Read-aloud ear confirms natural cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sea glass luminescence and mist refraction transforms lighthouse trope into earthbound ingenuity; risk in poetic accumulation heightens stakes organically. Closing communal sharing feels inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
