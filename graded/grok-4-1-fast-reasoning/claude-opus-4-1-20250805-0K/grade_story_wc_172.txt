<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the egg placement—trembling fingers against engineered drought—earning final endurance as translator of extinctions; flaws complicate without hedging, driving micro-choices with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build to Charged Poise/CR closure in helicopter glance back, reweighting destruction/salvation with conceptual cost legible in "cracks spelled out songs"; orientation anchors immediately, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Salt flat constrains egg burial and charges final image as natural preservative/amplifier; sensory selectivity (crunching boots, thunder) reflects Vera's priorities, evolving causally with heat wave seal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archive absences via disaster) signaled early, deepens via precise egg-cracking under lens, forcing trade-off with public persona; agency in burial forecloses sentiment's exposure, cost felt in diverted thunder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image "salvation looked exactly like destruction" offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting premise through particulars without moralizing; theme emerges organically from conflicted actions, inviting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (scientific precision laced with poetic loss) stable in third-limited POV; rhythmic control heightens pressure in thunder-modulated beats, no leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in egg-placement sequence; minor figurative density ("mineral matrix," "acoustic fossil") purposeful under textural lens, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of eco-terror as mourning transforms tropes; risk in premise (drought-maps, egg-fossilizing) heightens stakes inevitably, fresh in "archive of absences" reconfiguration.</comment>
