<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's frugality roots her motivation consistently, compelling micro-choices like tracing numbers and aligning charts under pressure. Interiority feels concrete and particular in "knowledge uncloak itself in her mind." Final sealing earned by prior devotion, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through layered discoveries tightening to CR closure: "Mara sealed humanity's first conscious contact," reweighting premise with frugal devotion as conceptual cost in final image. Orientation anchored early in descent to chambers. Single scene coherent, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Palace schematics and phosphorescent walls constrain choices (overlaying charts as Mars aligns) and charge final light eruption. Sensory details selective via POV (starlight gaps, warming stone). Micro-setting (tile cavity) mirrors internal revelation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode palace encryption) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via tile loosening, resonating walls, to sealing with agency in speaking numbers. One tightening (knowledge uncloaks) narrows to covenant cost: "devotion... could bridge the infinite." Cost legible in her smile knowing years purchased proof.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mathematical devotion emerges organically from particulars like magic square and stellar maps, answered non-literally in final starlight sealing without moralizing. Resonance in "covenant... united by... mathematical truth" reweights prior frugality. No tidy binaries; ambiguity in "something watching" lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in astronomical bias (celestial ratios, erosion patterns). Voice texture distinct in rhythmic phrasing like "dusky harmony," modulating with intensity. No head-hopping; inference matches focalizer knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene acceleration to climax, high density in integrated details. Minor artifact in repeated "empirically ironic" and "dusky harmony" paraphrase loops dulls propulsion slightly (-0.4), but no closure touch. Clean syntax, no filter stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Babylonian math as interstellar beacon transforms ancient tropes via palace-as-encryption. Risk in cosmic intelligence premise heightens stakes organically. Final reconfiguration ("meeting place between minds") inevitable from particulars.</comment>
