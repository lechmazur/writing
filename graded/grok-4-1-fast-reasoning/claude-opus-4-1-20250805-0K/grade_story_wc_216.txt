<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority shines in embodied time textures ("rough sandpaper of anxiety, the silk of contentment"), earning his purpose shift; motivation consistent as borrowed-time outsider. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, keeping it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: message density builds to CR closure in "Marcus understood his true purpose now," reweighting chronology with borrowed-time cost legible in final readiness to gather fragments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silo's crystalline walls and hum constrain discovery and charge ending image as "lighthouse... in all moments simultaneously," filtering through Marcus's textured perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rediscovery deepens accumulatively via urn fragment and network perception, narrowing to adaptive purpose; cost felt in living outside chronology, but pressure intellectual over visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of experiential time emerges organically from garage ads and textures, answered non-literally in final step "into the uncertain chronology" reweighting numbers' failure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in time's "texture" (sandpaper, silk, tar); rhythmic prose modulates discovery without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, sensation; purposeful figurative texture fits voice, minor conceptual redundancy in "messages" doesn't dull closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of garage-sale embeddings and time textures transforms post-numerical apocalypse trope; risks bold CR payoff from particulars.</comment>
