<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong consistent motivation rooted in deliberate forgetting, embodied in handling the swan and silence toward explorers; interiority concrete via patterns and root-paths. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, reducing micro-choice revelation under minimal pressure. No pivotal flaw at closure endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from swan-folding ritual to mushroom-words discovery tightening toward CR closure: "she had become what she documented," reweighting certainty with conceptual cost of eternal regeneration legible in final image. Orientation anchored early in library/refuge. One meaningful cadence shift suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Environment (overgrown library, phosphorescent moss, river sediment) selectively mirrors internal transformation, constraining perception and charging final ecosystem image. Recurrent swan and refuge evolve causally with her state. Body/setting integration via hands on vines and swan creases heightens 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witness without judgment) signaled early via swan ritual; accumulative deepening via mushroom-words and explorers forces endurance crystallization. Cost of softened certainty felt in "crumbling peace." Minor slip: low situational pressure, but lens-appropriate single tightening forecloses judgment path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of living chronicle emerges implicitly from book-mulch-moss cycle and swan creases; final image reconfigures premise non-literally as "pure witness, pure change" without moral. Resonant answer to change-without-judgment via particulars, no thematic echo. 9+ test met.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (vines as pages, river as memories); diction/rhythm modulate from patient ritual to wilder growth, teaching patterned elision paid at closure. No head-hopping or withholding; voice distinct and biased toward transformation patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "facts decomposed into dreams") integrated into action; varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in reflective stretches, but no muddle at peak discovery or closure image; read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist as regenerative ecosystem transforms hermit trope via book-trees and spore-words; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes of silence. Inevitable hindsight from swan-map to final garden image; no derivative echoes.</comment>
