<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and embodied emotion in "fingertips tingle with forgotten memories" and contradictory impulse to report vs. build monuments; transformation earned via grandmother link and prodding choice with burden cost. Minor slip in swift epiphany speed without deeper struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from speck to swirling leaves to monuments; closure as RR in "moonstone speck dissolved into her skin" with transformation cost legible. Orientation anchored early in arbor hush; no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration like "seeds hummed frequencies" and upward-falling leaves with vein-letters; arbor constrains via whispers and gaps, charging final moss transformation of ash-gray palette.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of orderly sorting vs. anomaly/purpose signaled early, tightens via prodding reversal narrowing to inheritance choice; cost in "burden, her mossy delight" felt on-page, agency in building.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of bridging earth-sky via forgotten things emerges organically from leaf-messages and monuments; final "symphony only she could fully comprehend" offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in "reading currents like scripture"; rhythmic prose modulates from hush precision to swirling intensity, purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image integration; minor repetition of "mossy delight" purposeful but borders scaffold, no loops or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skyborne folklore world with upward leaves and humming seeds; risk-taking in vertical gravity rebellion heightens stakes, inevitable in transformation payoff.</comment>
