<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore via songs roots in traits (tinkerer contrasts tools with memory), with embodied emotion in voice crack and glowing fingers; micro-choices like humming reveal values. Internal conflict subtle (logic vs old ways) but acts in scene. Closure endurance earned without safety-hedging; minor slip in stock tinkerer backstory not touching peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: humming density builds to vine pulse/uncurl, villagers' arrival, communal singing reconfiguring disconnection. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (Elara, arbor, dawn). On-page RR closure in blooming vine and pulsing heartbeat image with generational cost legible; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy vivid and purposeful: dew/vines (touch), mist melody (sound), gold light shaft (sight) constrain choice and trigger uncurl. Arbor as micro-setting evolves dawn-to-moon, mirroring internal renewal and charging final silvered leaves/perfume image. No white-room; details bias through Elara's ritual priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive vine/rituals pre-moon) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening songs → tendril response → villager plea/joining, narrowing to communal alignment. Agency in Elara's humming/teaching forecloses hollow ceremony with felt emotional cost (cracked voice). One tightening sufficient; minor abstractness in "sacred songs silent" but charges closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reconnection via old ways emerges organically from songs reviving vine, culminating in non-literal final image of pulsing tendril binding souls. Subtext in silence-to-song shift avoids moralizing; resonant reconfiguration reweights premise without binaries. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in close third-person, perceptual signature biased to golden imagery/songs reflecting Elara's whimsical lens. Rhythm modulates hush-to-celebration; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Teach us"). No head-hopping or leakage; diction purposeful without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "tendril shivered" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, syntax propels via short peak sentences. Figurative pattern (golden threads, woven stories) taught early, coherent without muddle. Minor elevated diction fits lyric mode but risks overwriting in arbor cathedral line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tinkerer revives folklore not via gadgets but memory/songs, transforming trope through specific arbor alignment. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; final heartbeat image inevitable in hindsight. No derivative templates; bold voice commits to premise.</comment>
