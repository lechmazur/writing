<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mae's motivation rooted in father's legacy compels escalating choices, with contradictory impulses (familial pull vs. duty) embodied in her steady pulse and watch fob handling during the reveal. Internal conflict acts in scene via micro-choices like dangling the fob. Final renunciation (exile from market) earned by prior causality, foreclosing return with felt cost in "never return."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: false starts → name-drop → reveal → recording payoff. Closure as Conceptual Repricing in final beach image and "weight forever changed," reweighting legacy with exile cost legible in "she could never return." Orientation anchored early via piling and market sprawl. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pier and market constrain choices (maze navigation, shadows for whispers) and charge final image (dissolving into mist). Sensory hierarchy via Mae's bias: rotting wood rhythms father's history, candlelight catches fob. Rotting pier evolves causally to beach gold at dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thwart shipment via recording) signaled early, tightens via badge reveal narrowing options. Agency in fob ploy forces trade-off; cost visible in woman's retreat and exile warning. Escalation causal under lens, protagonist-driven to Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trust's sound emerges via particulars (fob snap, breath intake), reweighting legacy in final line "Some sounds... worth the breaking" without moralizing. Resonance from irony gaps (Mae's infiltration mirrors father's "honest" end). Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Mae-filtered noticing (tide's rhythm through wood, watch against hip). Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven ("Tommy's girl" tests loyalty). Rhythmic control modulates pressure; no head-hopping, stable limited third.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors like "algae in still water" purposeful but border overwrought in reveal beat, docking from 9+. Varied rhythm passes ear test; no loops, minimal scaffolds. Closure image clear, no artifacts dulling it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pirate market under pier transforms infiltration trope via family heirloom sting; fob-badge twist inevitable from journals/false starts. Fresh synthesis of legacy and sound motif risks bold lyricism without gimmick. No derivative echoes.</comment>
