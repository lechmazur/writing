<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to index truths intensifies credibly under time pressure, shown through embodied sensory micro-choices like tracing spines and isolating frequencies. Interiority particular via vibration-sensing trait, with calm competence balanced by urgency. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from irregularity detection to forgery pattern and corp profit reveal, tightening to pulse deadline. Closure as Charged Poise/CR in final ascent image, reweighting guardianship premise with conceptual cost of interrupted work ("she had marked enough"). Orientation anchored early at dome.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Algae glow and water constrain choices (enables ink visibility, scatters frequencies at pulse), charging final image of green-glowing truth. Sensory hierarchy (vibrations over sight) reflects librarian bias, integrated into action without stalls. Micro-setting (spines, stamp) lived-in and pivotal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (index before power return) signaled early, escalates via pattern discovery and algae intensification under Accumulative lens, narrowing options to rushed marking. Agency in readjust/stamp rhythm forces trade-off; cost legible in pulse scattering signals, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth preservation amid deception emerges organically from patchwork authentic pages vs. forgeries, answered non-literally in glowing ink enduring for next indexer. Final image reweights noisy surface vs. patient depths without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature: selective vibration/touch noticing biases calm, purposeful diction. Rhythmic control modulates from tranquil to urgent ("stamp striking... echoed"). No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel through action; purposeful algae motif avoids loops. Minor overwriting in "dappled resolve" repetition jars slightly in peak, but pattern-taught; no scaffold or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of submerged archive, vibration forensics, algae-lit truth in sci-fi frame feels inevitable, transforming preservation trope via patient detection. Risky quiet closure heightens conceptual stakes without gimmick.</comment>
