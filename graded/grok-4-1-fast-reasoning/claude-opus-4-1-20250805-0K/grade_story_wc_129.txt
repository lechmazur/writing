<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kira's motivation roots in calloused hands and sympathetic certainty that compels communal trust and search; ancient woman's exile mirrors her dedication risk, earning stasis. Minor dilution from summarized youth gathering, but relationships crucible intact at sculpture extension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tag pattern density builds to spiral revelation, cadence shift at crater discovery yields RR (reunion reconfigures isolation). Cost legible in "self-exiled when she believed her work had failed"; orientation anchored in para 1, scope fits single-POV progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystalline fruits "catching fire" and obsidian edges constrain weaving/search, charging final arbor mirror; sensory hierarchy (light pooling, lantern pillars) mirrors kinship via POV urgency. Spatial choreography clear in descent, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim lost artist for kinship) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via ritual mapping to seventh-night spiral; agency in descent forecloses exile path with relational cost at "helping her stand."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Webs of kinship emerges via reed sculptures connecting figures, resolved non-literally in arbor "reflecting back the faces"; ambiguity in lost tongues lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("moonlight pooled," "luminescent ache") biases toward connection; dialogue natural/subtextual (Tomás warning vs. Kira certainty), dialects distinct without caricature. Stable close-third POV modulates rhythm under communal pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image ("twisted and bent the pliant stalks"); rhythm varies (short ritual beats to long final weave), metaphors coherent around light/obsidian without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinct dialects/tags/reeds transforms artist-exile trope; risky lyric fantasy risks boldness, inevitable in hindsight via pattern-taught search to "grafted a new branch."</comment>
