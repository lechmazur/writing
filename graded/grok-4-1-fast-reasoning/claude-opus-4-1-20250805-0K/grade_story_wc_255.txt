<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong character depth in Mira's texture-based perceptions driving micro-choices like flower arrangements that compel Enzo's vulnerability; Enzo's arc earned through embodied shakes and burned letters; minor summary in "This was how she'd survived" dilutes peak pressure slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via revelations and arrangements culminating in Charged Poise RR at reunion/embrace; cost legible in Enzo's sagged shoulders and reed-singing sculpture; orientation anchored immediately in courtyard; time compression purposeful without causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Courtyard micro-setting constrains barters and arrangements while kiln/propped canvas ground spatial choreography; recurring glass/reed charges final image; sensory textures (dew, light, herbs) filter via Mira's bias; phoenix ruins subtly mirror internal breakage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant barter stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via daughter revelation forcing Enzo's learning/renunciation of clear glass; agency in Mira's reading and teaching forecloses isolation with emotional cost; single deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of brokenness-revealed wholeness emerges organically via shifting flower meanings and reed-in-glass; final painting offers non-literal CR repricing phoenix destruction without moralizing; subtext in silences and arrangements invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with colorblind perceptual signature (grays, textures) biasing details; dialogue natural/subtextual (e.g., "Useless to me" vs. twitching fingers); rhythmic syntax modulates revelation beats; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., flower shifts reveal backstory while advancing barter); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; specifics like "infinite shades" propel without overwriting; clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of colorblind flower semiotics, sonic glass, post-phoenix barter transforms tropes; risk in symbolic layering heightens reunion stakes organically; no derivatives, inevitable hindsight via particulars.</comment>
