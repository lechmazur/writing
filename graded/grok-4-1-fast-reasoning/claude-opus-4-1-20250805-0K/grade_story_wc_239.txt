<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaia's interiority particularized through embodied contradictions like clutching the dictionary amid cosmic stutter; final self-definition as "the question that answers itself" earns change via layered arbitration impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising from isolated endings to overlapping chord; CR closure lands in "illusion unraveled... into everything" with conceptual cost of infinite forget/remember iterations legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library's impossible shelves and frozen motes constrain paths via "wanderingly exact precision" tied to dictionary; charges final image as walls turn transparent, expressing higher truth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of arbitration tightens accumulatively through hiccups and "maya" realization narrowing to unify; agency in walking/reading drives escalation, cost felt in foreclosed illusion/path via dictionary's "Continue."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of opposites-as-illusion emerges implicitly via unifying steps; resonant non-literal answer in "pause between breaths where all possibilities existed simultaneously," reweighting prior layers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature in etymologies ("reconcile... to call back together") and spiral diction stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation heightens under stutter without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful helix-patterned figures ("möbius strip," "golden spiral") taught early, varying rhythm propels to closure; no loops or scaffolds dull peak unification beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dictionary as cosmic lexicon and library as self-arbitrating helix transforms end-of-world trope; risk in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight via "resounding hush" callbacks heightening stakes.</comment>
