<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaia's motivation intensifies convincingly from personal chant to communal defiance, with embodied filtering via rhythm; elderly woman's skepticism adds pressure. Ambient awareness diagnostic without full embodiment slightly undercuts interior contradiction in pivotal sensing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from solo approach to choral creation to sustained bursts, with clear orientation by para 2. Closure as resonant reconfiguration lands on-page in rocket flowering and "make our own constellations," reweighting Dimming with conceptual cost of prior starless despair.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Phosphorescent moss and mosaic integrate purposefully, constraining via materials (moss for green, tiles for blue) that enable climax launch. Sensory hierarchy (visual bloom vs. brittle laughter) mirrors Kaia's filtering; final "fortress bloomed differently" charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy hopelessness) signaled early, escalates via textural density of joining voices/ingredients to sustained bursts narrowing options from individual to collective endurance. Agency in teaching/launching forecloses solo wandering with felt communal cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of filtering despair into defiant wonder emerges organically via chant evolution and mosaic message, culminating in non-literal answer to "fireworks without stars?" via unnatural colors sustaining light. Resonance reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in chant-weaving syntax and selective noticing (despair via awareness, mosaic words); dialogue natural with subtext (woman's skepticism/hope). Minor register elevation in metaphors doesn't obscure closure rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with chant rhythm propelling beats; varied syntax breathes with hush-to-burst cadence. Slight figurative density ("breathing green light," "sustained flowering") borders overwrought in opening but weaves purposefully without loop artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Dimming despair, fireworks alchemy, and mosaic defiance transforms tropes via kerosene's slow burn sustaining unnatural stars. Risky textural build to communal poise feels inevitable, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
