<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in weaving to bind logic/impossibility, intensifying to completion. Interiority concrete in tactile thread-testing but leans abstract/philosophical, with less embodied contradiction or flaw-driven struggle. Final smile and exit earn a subtle endurance without deeper micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from static illusions to fluid portals, culminating in CR closure ("gallery breathed on without her, realistically imaginary") with conceptual cost in dissolved boundaries. Orientation anchored early (gallery, evacuated visitors). One tightening via violent eruptions narrows to thread exhaustion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details (Penrose stairs descending into itself, impossible triangle rotating) filter through her perceptual bias, constraining choices as exhibits respond to weaving. Gallery as micro-setting charges final image, evolving causally from painted to dimensional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover texture of connection) signaled early, escalates texturally via density increase in eruptions that transform space, forcing balance of logic/dream. Agency in persistent weaving forecloses paths with felt cost (thread runs out, fever behind eyes). Climax tightening legible in violent spillover.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of perception/reality boundaries emerges organically from weaving particulars, reweighted in final image of labyrinthine gallery without moralizing. Silvery filaments as recurring motif subtly constrain and resonate. Protagonist arc inextricable from question, inviting ambiguity on connection's nature.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (walls breathe, thread pulses) stable in close third-person, modulating rhythm with intensity. Compression purposeful and pattern-taught early (impossible geometries). No head-hopping or leakage; diction matches her architect mindset.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion, high density in integrated sensory/prose (sinew sang, patterns spilled like living equations). Minor paraphrase loops ("patterns began to erupt," "realistically imaginary") but purposeful in textural build; no closure muddle or heavy artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of optical illusions as consciousness fault lines, transformed via sinew-harvested doubts into navigable portals. Risky lyric accumulation heightens conceptual stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration inevitable from established premise.</comment>
