<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marina's interiority shines through concrete pattern analysis and embodied loss, with micro-choices like following weather codes earning her final mapping; contradictory determination vs. grief layers realistically without therapy-speak. Minor unearned epiphany at threshold softens peak motivation slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density via navigational codes to on-page CR closure (threshold discovery reconfigures loss with conceptual cost of perpetual transition); orientation anchors early on terrace; single scene holds without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maze stalks, terrace railing grain, and central soil circle constrain choices (e.g., turns at pressure symbols) and charge final image; sensory whisper, sway, cool earth filter through Marina's perceptual bias, mirroring internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel father's vanishing via sacred thresholds) tightens accumulatively through code-guided navigation narrowing paths; agency in intuiting turns forecloses dead ends with felt isolation cost, legible at center kneeling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love as "necessary distance" emerges organically from maze geometries and logbook symbols, culminating in resonant CR final image (drawing codes amid presence/absence) without moralizing; ambiguity of father's choice lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of geometric analysis; lyrical diction ("fractured hush") modulates rhythmically with intensity, prose as character reflecting analytical mind; no dialogue, no issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid, purposeful images (spiraling grain, pressure differentials); varied syntax propels accumulatively, but minor overwriting in metaphors like "featherly determined" and repeated "fractured hush" create slight template cadence in opening/closing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corn maze as weather map for metaphysical thresholds transforms loss trope through specific geometries and micro-climates; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens conceptual stakes inevitably.</comment>
