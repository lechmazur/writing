<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in Marlow's "mournful elation" and the bride's protective toxicity act simultaneously, earning the final freedom; relationship crucible forces mutual release without unearned epiphany. Interiority concrete via embodied talisman hum and cold translucence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hauntings and alchemical pulses builds to RR/Charged Poise closure when bead cracks, releasing memories with conceptual cost of broken chains legible in "The debt was never mine to pay."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Alchemical fruits and mercury pools constrain choices and mirror internal states, charging final image as they wither to "ordinary apples and pears"; sensory hierarchy (pulsing lights, cold breath) reflects Marlow's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt repayment) signaled early, escalates via bride's solidification and bead pulse under Accumulative lens, narrowing to agency in her touch foreclosing binding with felt cost in Marlow's gasp and weeping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of venomous love emerges organically from dance across lifetimes, resonant non-literal answer in bride's dissipation reweighting premise: freedom via letting go, charged by thawing fields without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in alchemical biases; dialogue subtextual ("debt grows heavier") pursues goals, voice modulates rhythmically from crystalline frost to warm rain without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (hearts on branches) integrated into action; rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or muddle even in peak bead-crack beat, vivid without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms ghost/alchemy tropes via bloodline debt and resonant release; risk in lyric density heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from bead's early hum to dust.</comment>
