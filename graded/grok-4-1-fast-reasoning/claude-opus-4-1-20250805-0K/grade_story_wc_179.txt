<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's scheming pacifism shines in planning three moves ahead via touch, earning the Magistrate's transformation; contradictory impulses (strategy for peace) act in scene. Minor abstract slips like "unresolved rage encoded in cells" border therapy-speak but don't flatten pressure. Final choice to use broken box reveals values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memory/touch builds to RR closure in Magistrate's loosening grip and rippling reality, with felt cost in rewritten cellular memory. Orientation anchored early in sanctuary/Marcus/box. No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics/final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary constrains all communication to touch, charging closure; music box pin as micro-setting evolves from diagnosis to healing tool. Sensory focus on tactile "ghost melody" and "bones" reflects POV urgency. Final wall-touch integrates setting into memory repository.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teach resentment release to save son) signaled early, tightens via box-touch reversal that narrows rage options under Accumulative lens. Agency in Marcus's transmission forces trade-off; cost legible in weeping and "stranglehold" release. No abstract stakes; son's fever felt as inheritance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of releasing inherited violence emerges via particulars like pin/box/memory, resonating in "broken things could still create beauty" without stating moral. Final image reweights premise: new song from acceptance. Subtext in "scheming against our own nature" avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with tactile perceptual signature ("spoke directly to his bones"); rhythmic prose modulates from setup to charged poise. No dialogue fits soundless rule. Voice distinct in cellular/memory idiom, consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "reality bent like water" advances atmosphere/causality); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor paraphrase loops on "cellular memory" (3 instances) dull slightly but don't obscure closure. No artifacts in peak: metaphors cohere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifism/cellular memory in soundless realm transforms inheritance tropes; risk in non-verbal conviction heightens stakes. Box/pin as constraint feels inevitable. No derivative echoes; bold premise commits fully.</comment>
