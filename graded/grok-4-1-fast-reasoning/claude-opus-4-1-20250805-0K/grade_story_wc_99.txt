<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kenji's contradictory impulses—measured teaching voice masking grief, silent tide-calls vs. urge to write—act simultaneously in the pruning lesson and lace-tracing, earning the final renunciation of silence with visible cost in passing the compass.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of lace patterns, compass spins, and bonsai cuts build to Charged Poise closure when needle points to "cerulean that pools in the hollow of a throat," reconfiguring unsaid words with emotional cost legible in the impossible bell toll.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Recurring lace and compass as micro-settings constrain choices (tracing reveals instructions tilting present stance) and charge final image (compass handed over after needle's revelation), with sensory details like "salt and green smell of rain-washed moss" woven purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciling severance tightens accumulatively through lace's progressive decoding narrowing silent endurance to tomorrow's letter, with agency in micro-choices like snip instruction forcing trade-off; cost unmistakable in "every word he'd failed to say."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance through unsaid anchors emerges organically from particulars like "tide's return" knot and compass cargo, with final image offering non-literal resonant answer—needle's cerulean reprices prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in nature-filtered metaphors ("roots remember everything the tree forgets") and rhythmic modulation matching Kenji's placid cadence sustain under pressure; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, advancing via student's questions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "The needle stopped spinning, pointing toward a color he'd never seen before" advances plot, reveals character, charges theme); varied rhythm, no loops, purposeful metaphors cohere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lace-encoded war instructions, ghost compass undelivered apologies, and bonsai as grief-work transforms master-student trope, with risk-taking lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight via color revelation heightening emotional stakes.</comment>
