<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied scars glowing during shadow-linking, revealing contradictory tenderness in devastation; final endurance of solitude earned by prior severances. Micro-choices like placing shadow against her chest hierarchize values with visible cost. No diagnostic labels; flaws complicate without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shadow encroachment accumulates density toward CR closure in final image of warming ring and next shadow, reweighting thresholds as invitations with conceptual cost of absence. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (sanctuary edge, pillars). One tightening via shadow's tremble forces scar-link.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Charcoal pillars and starlight constrain: light leaks through fresh scar, mirroring internal wounds and charging final image where stars define rather than destroy shadows. Sensory hierarchy (pooled shadows as wounded animals) filters through keeper's bias. Evolving absent roof admits starlight purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching shadows to exhale needs) signaled early, tightens via encroachment despite "not ready," forcing scar-link agency; cost legible in her glowing scars and enforced solitude. Accumulative pressure coheres without reversal overload. No abstract stakes; visceral in shuddering edges.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of necessary endings emerges from particulars (severed bridges as practice, scars as doorways); final ring-warmth offers non-literal resonance reweighting emptiness as invitation. Subtext in silence of meditation; no moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from fading thresholds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (shadows dragging like wounded animals); rhythmic modulation peaks in "loaded emptiness between heartbeats." Minimal dialogue natural ("You're not ready"). No head-hopping; diction reflects damaged grace.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "starlight still leaked through the wound" advances setting/conflict/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; purposeful metaphors consistent (burnt fingers, noose embrace). Minor overwriting in reflective blocks doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: shadows as suffocated entities healed via scar-links transforms abandonment tropes; risk in lyrical tenderness for darkness inevitable via ring's reprise. No derivative echoes; bold conceptual integrity in bridges-as-light.</comment>
