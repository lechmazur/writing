<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of Kess's dreamlessness through concrete micro-choices like touching the clock and singing fractured lullabies under pirate pressure; contradictory impulses (linear past vs. quantum now) act simultaneously in the climax. Pirate as secondary applies targeted pressure without diluting her arc. Final endurance of eternal midnight feels earned with visible conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of quantum patterns builds to charged poise closure in final image of unturnable clock and unrhyming lullaby, reconfiguring her guardianship with undeniable cost of stalled time. Orientation anchored early via dunes and job; pirate arrival motivated by cargo shimmer. Single scene coherent, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glowing dunes and quantum blooms constrain choices (she matches their rhythm to charm) and charge final image (dune pulses approval, sings harmonics). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: phosphorescence and helical sand filtered through lullaby memories. World rules consistent via action, no static dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guard sparks from pirates) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pirate's reach forcing louder song and reality's stuttered choice. Agency in charming wave functions forecloses theft with on-page cost (pirate fades, but her dreamless tending persists). Escalation coherent under textural lens, one decisive deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of cultivating wonder amid fracture emerges organically from sparks, clock, and lullaby shifts; final image offers resonant non-literal answer (tending non-existent dreams reweights superposition's cost). No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "when the world finally chose." Particulars like nightmare container deepen without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature: quantum chaos perceived through old-world lullabies and clock. Voice modulates rhythmically with pressure (shortened sentences in confrontation). Sparse dialogue goal-driven, subtext-rich ("seeds for unlit corners"); pirate's echo distinguishes idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (wave functions, helical sand) taught early, propels via varied rhythm matching scene cadence. Minor metaphor density in opening dunes risks overload but coheres without muddle at closure. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts; clean propulsion to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum superposition with dream-freight economy and lullaby-charming transforms post-apoc tropes organically. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes (reality chooses her version), inevitable in hindsight via clock/lullaby arc. Bold conceptual integrity without retreat or generics.</comment>
