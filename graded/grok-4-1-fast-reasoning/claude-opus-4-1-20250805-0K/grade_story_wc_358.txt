<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maya's motivation rooted in investigator traits drives adaptation from survey to prevention, with embodied disorientation under pressure; micro-choices like installing monitors reveal values. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, keeping it from 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from patch to convergence discovery to monitor installation, with CR closure in final patch image reweighting expansion threat as conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early; one tightening at convergence sighting suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Containers as "metallic canyons" and "steel flowers" constrain navigation and charge final image; wind/smoke tracers filter through investigator's priorities, mirroring internal haze. Recurrent setting evolves with convergence lean, no white-room flaws.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survey to prevent expansion) signaled early, escalates via deepening realization of time-dilation and growth rate under accumulative lens; agency in perimeter setup forecloses passive investigation with felt global cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of "accidents as emergence" emerges organically from wind patterns to foresight vision in patch; final image offers non-literal reweighting without moralizing, resonant via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (hazy precision in observations); rhythmic syntax modulates from documentation to epiphany, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; minor paraphrase in wind descriptions purposeful for pattern-building, no loops dulling closure. Propulsion peaks in "hands worked...mind raced."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aviation anomaly as time-convergence transforms frozen-town trope; risk in warped physics pays off at closure without gimmickry.</comment>
