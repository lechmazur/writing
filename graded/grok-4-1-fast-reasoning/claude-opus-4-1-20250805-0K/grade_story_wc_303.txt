<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation intensifies credibly from coffee-stain foresight to forging papers and baiting Marcus, with embodied contradiction in her "words tasting of mulberry wine." Internal conflict acts in scene via lie-with-truth strategy. Minor flaw: Marcus feels slightly stock as "old money" antagonist without distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from stains/plants to violin's wail/sublimation as Charged Poise closure, reconfiguring empire dream with legible cost in "the academic empire she'd craved had dissolved." Single scene causality tight; orientation anchored early in observatory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Velvet drapes and jasmine constrain via sound absorption/telepathic warnings, charging final "puddle that reflected stars not visible from Earth." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (botanical whispers over records); midsummer dusk mirrors bruised choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dream-empire vs Thule truth) signaled early, tightens via Elara's agency in forging/letting-touch, foreclosing empire path with on-page cost. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens; plant urgency forces crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of unlaunderable theft emerges organically via stolen songs/violin justice, resonant in final image of ivy-spreading truth without moralizing. Particulars like mulberry stains reweight prior fragments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (plant thoughts, stain patterns) with rhythmic modulation under climax stress; dialogue subtextual ("The documentation is irrefutable") pursues goals. Voice distinct, lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative density overwrites in opening ("bruised twilight," "perforated destiny") slightly dulls early propulsion; climax clean. No loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ice-singers' violin with bloodline curse synthesizes myth/fantasy organically, transforming artifact-authentication trope via plant telepathy and stain divination. Risky lyric closure feels inevitable.</comment>
