<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between father's bunker compression and trellis expansion act in scene via her choice to stay on deck; final vial for father earned by inversion growth with emotional cost of past dissolution. Interiority particular via silence flavors and embodied inversion lightness. No diagnostic labels; flaws (claustrophobia) complicate then resolve organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to doll-crack inversion climax, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure where safety reconfigures from contraction to expansion, cost legible in "claustrophobia...stretched and dissolved." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Trellis glass and clouds constrain her deck choice, doll as recurring object charges final reform; sensory hierarchy (honey-copper silence frost) narrows under inversion urgency. Details evolve causally (groaning beams to garden), mirroring internal stretch without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect inversion silences) signaled early, deepens via doll sprout reweighting options amid timed pressure; agency in vial-filling forecloses bunker mindset with felt past-cost. Accumulative escalation via density surge at "tendril emerged," charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of expansive safety emerges via bunker contrast and sprout garden, final vial image offers non-literal answer reweighting contraction premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like "liquid starlight" hushes; no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in silence-as-flavor noticing biased by collector's priorities. Rhythm modulates with inversion surge; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "silence crystallized...taste its honey-copper sweetness"); varied rhythm, no loops. Minor figurative density in sprout beat ("colors that had no names") purposeful but borders overwrites, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity inversion harvesting silence via sprouting doll transforms safety tropes; bold risk in xenial trellis frame heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from early doll cue to garden payoff.</comment>
