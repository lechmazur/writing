<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kessa's motivation to compile fragments roots in expertise and intensifies via micro-choices like emotional arrangement and valve use, earning communal transformation. Interiority concrete in light-layered discoveries; flaws in blind spots to absence's grammar drive competent struggle. Final renunciation of finality feels earned with embodied cost in perpetual compilation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from personal valve to public archive, culminating in CR via final sigh reweighting absence into meaning with conceptual cost of ongoing incompleteness. Orientation anchored early in arrival and exile context. One tightening via staggered intervals deepens stake without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Salt crystals, rain-washed windows, and pearl-white towers constrain choices via light-timed reveals, charging final droplet-fractured image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (archivist notices patterns, water-marks). Micro-setting of valve-as-tool evolves tactilely, mirroring internal transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fragment-compilation signaled early, tightens via absence-grammar realization narrowing to emotional mapping over chronology. Accumulative pressure coheres to public opening with felt cost in incompleteness; agency in valve incorporation forecloses tidy recovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of absence's grammar emerges organically from fragments and gaps, resonant in final valve-sigh reweighting loss into possibility without moralizing. Particulars like blurred photo and torn poem avoid platitudes; counter-reading of transformation lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (spray patterns, light dispersions) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from descriptive to charged poise. Brief dialogue natural, subtextual in Matthias exchange advancing goal. No head-hopping; diction biases toward archivist's precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job via image-action integration, e.g., "light through rain-washed windows revealed different layers." Rhythmic variety, no loops or scaffolds; figurative spray motif taught early, coherent without muddle in peak archive-growth beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist premise with absence-grammar transforms exile trope; valve's whispered percussion inflects turns organically. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes in emotional topology, inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
