<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aldric's withdrawal and tree-reading expertise motivate the oath consistently, but interior conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; emotions feel atmospheric rather than embodied. The final hand-take shows credible endurance with cost (splinters, armor dissolution), but no strong blind spots compound before resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from entry to oath-stirred shift; orientation anchors early (Aldric, greenhouse, endless night by para 2). Closure as CR/RR lands on-page in transformation image ("solid and quantum simultaneously") with legible conceptual cost of surrender; one tightening via marionette awakening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains via tree languages guiding Aldric's path and pulses charging climax; recurring silver-barked trees/fruit mirror internal shift and charge final expansion. Sensory hierarchy (copper/snow-melt air, obsidian clicks) filters through knight's exile bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reenact oath for patterns) signaled early via program; Accumulative escalation via density to reality glimpses forces stance crystallization in hand-take, with visible cost (blood-seeds, armor loss). Agency clear, one deepening narrows to infinite surrender over isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of unmade possibility emerges organically from orchard equations to final guardianship image, reweighting exile as capacity; no moralizing, resonance in "glow of unmanifest tomorrows." Counter-reading lingers in eternal night cracked by could-be light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (trees as theorems); rhythmic texture modulates from heavy silence to "silver bells" laugh under bliss. Oath bypasses ear effectively as voice-motivated elision; no head-hopping, diction suits mystical exile.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels from door-press to expansion; metaphors cohere in mystical pattern without muddle. Minor overwriting in "ten thousand potential worlds" para risks density dip but integrates via payoff; no loops, clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical puppets/quantum orchard transforms knight trope via "unsnapped" reality-weaving; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at blood-seed sprouting. Bold conceptual integrity without retreat to safety.</comment>
