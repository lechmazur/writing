<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya's embodied skills and micro-choices under time pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, with blindness as competence rather than hindrance; Chen applies light pressure without dominating. Final endurance in calm repair earns a meaningful reconfiguration with felt cost in her deepened craft connection. Minor flaw: inspirational trope borders stock, but transformed via sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via repair beats to Charged Poise closure in drone release and "this old depot helped me find mine," reweighting blindness as asset with conceptual cost legible in final image. Orientation anchored early in depot/shop. One tightening via "twenty minutes" announcement narrows options without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mist and water droplets recur as micro-setting constraining choices (e.g., spray test reveals cracks) and charging final drone release image. Sensory hierarchy (vibration/sound over sight) filters through Maya's POV bias, vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography coherent in shop-to-doorway arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (drone repair for ship's safe voyage) signaled early, tightens via announcement forcing precise pressure modulation; agency in deliberate motions forecloses failure path with felt delicacy cost. Accumulative escalation via intensifying density culminates in successful patch/hover. Minor abstractness in ship stakes, but on-page drone test materializes them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of harmony in brokenness emerges organically from repair particulars, resonating in final "broken things learning to work again" image without overt moralizing. Subtext in Maya's calm amid chaos reweights disability premise. Slight −0.3 for near-thematic echo in "Beauty isn't just visual," but earned via prior sensory buildup.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (vibrations as "stories"); dialogue natural/subtextual (Chen's awe advances wonder). Rhythmic control modulates with repair intensity. No head-hopping; voice coherent and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences weave action/sensory (e.g., "droplets hit her workbench" advances diagnosis). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; mist motif purposeful without overwriting. Zero scaffold in peak patch beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: blindness + mist refraction/sound as synesthetic repair transforms inspirational artisan trope into ingenious, sensory-specific craft. Risky POV constraint heightens stakes; final depot/drone image inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
