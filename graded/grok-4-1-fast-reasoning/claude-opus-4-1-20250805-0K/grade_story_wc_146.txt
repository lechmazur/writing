<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bell tuner's patience and cryptic nature drive teaching pivotal to revival, earning town's change; Thomas arc adds growth. Lacks embodied internal contradiction or flaws complicating her unflawed competence during key instruction moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solo walks to collective dance, culminating in Charged Poise closure as tuner departs and town's final symphony reconfigures self-sustenance with felt cost of faltering risk. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via physical responses (cracks seal) narrows decay option.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobblestones, fountain, archway constrain and respond to footsteps, charging revival; recurring stones hum under steps mirror harmony theme. Archway's keystone strike in mayor scene and final touch evolve causally, filtering through collective perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore heartbeat) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as participation grows and bells ring, forcing collective endurance. Pivotal deepening in physical changes forecloses collapse with visible cost to neglect; agency in learned patterns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Harmony-through-movement emerges organically from patterns and revival, resonating in final image of ongoing dance without moralizing. Minor slip: "Cities aren't made of stone" dialogue borders direct statement, but events earn it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person voice with fable texture modulates rhythmically, perceptual bias toward sounds selective; dialogue subtextual (riddles) distinguishes tuner. Stable omniscient distance serves accumulative scope without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels from hush to symphony; no loops or artifacts, rhythm echoes footsteps (e.g., "measured steps"). Final line image recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of footsteps-as-prayer reviving town transforms urban fable trope; risk in magical realism pays off in inevitable harmony premise, heightening stakes via collapse contrast.</comment>
