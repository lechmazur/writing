<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaine's titan-gears embody contradictory machine-flesh impulses acting in her guidance choices; visitor's observations force relational micro-turns. Earned endurance in her recalled smelting forecloses explorer path with creel-cost echo. Minor visitor archetypal thinness doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from visitor arrival to moon-apex furnace roar; Charged Poise closure in woman's prismatic emergence reconfigures identity options with heavier creel as felt cost. Orientation anchored early in atrium; single scene holds seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tidal atrium's glass/ocean integration constrains smelting timing via moon-tide sync and charges final image of breathing walls. Creel as micro-setting recurs tactilely, mirroring flux; sensory selectivity (salt-metal tang) biases via Kaine's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of smelting harmony signaled in "I've come to smelt," deepens accumulatively through memory-threads and furnace acceptance, narrowing to prismatic refraction with trade-off cost over unified self. Agency in creel-filling/endurance crystallizes under moon pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Paradox acceptance emerges via particulars like gears/skin and selves-in-creel, reweighting premise in final "constellation of possibilities" image without moral. Subtext in "not into one, but into a harmony" lingers ambiguously resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with flux-biased perceptual signature (tides as breath, gears creaking); rhythmic diction modulates serene intensity. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishing voices via simplicity ("I've come to smelt").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "pages that fell... pulsing with displaced meaning"; varied rhythm passes read-aloud, no loops/artifacts. "Prismatic, refracting different selves" peaks with flawless propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of flux-books, identity-smelting, gear-librarian transforms tropes organically; creel-as-fragment-holder risks bold organic-mechanical fusion heightening stakes. Inevitable hindsight from early atrium flux to eternal preservation.</comment>
