<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margot's dry wit shields her revelation ("almost too convenient"), and her obsession compels the earned decision to share research; inspector applies relational pressure without diluting her arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns (falcon, condensation, ridges) build to Charged Poise closure when Margot pulls the phrasebook ("risk everything"); legible cost in alliance reconfiguration anchors before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen lake's pressure ridges and outpost window constrain mapping and revelation, charging final thaw image; sensory details (groaning wind, frost patterns) filter through Margot's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rivers' source) signaled early tightens accumulatively via condensation reversal, forcing alliance choice; inspector's arrival complicates with familial pressure, cost felt in risked secrecy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Convergence theme emerges organically from dendritic rivulets mirroring ridges, reweighting buried rivers in final charts/phrasebook image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (asymmetric frost, rivulets branching); dialogue carries subtext ("He left very little behind") distinguishing voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image ("held the book up to the window where her breath had created condensation"); varied rhythm propels without loops or overwrites.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ingenious condensation-as-map synthesizes ice-age atlas editing with subterranean revelation; fresh polyglot marginalia transforms convergence trope.</comment>
