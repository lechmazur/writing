<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between regret and correction act vividly in decoding threads; final forgiveness earned by thread-pulling causality with visible cost of unchangeable past. Interiority concrete and chess-specific; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from boundary tracing to thread adjustments culminating in Conceptual Repricing of self-forgiveness. Orientation anchored early; closure cost legible in "couldn't change the past" line with felt emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Time-frozen village and platinum pieces constrain choices (vibrations guide approach, threads enable revision); final image of suspended raindrops charges closure. Sensory details POV-filtered through chess lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redemption tightens accumulatively via thread-decoding reversal that narrows to self-acceptance; agency in adjustments forecloses guilt path with on-page cost. Pressure coheres without micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect wisdom emerges organically from mirrored chess mistakes and thread revisions; final copper piece image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting teaching's dual courage/grace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with chess-tutor perceptual signature (pieces as sacrifices, threads as positions); rhythmic diction modulates from fidgeting tension to hush resolution without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak thread-pulling beat. Propulsion aligns with hush's building quietude.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frozen-time fantasy and chess redemption transforms tropes via tapestry mechanics; risk of lyric hush pays off in charged closure without gimmickry.</comment>
