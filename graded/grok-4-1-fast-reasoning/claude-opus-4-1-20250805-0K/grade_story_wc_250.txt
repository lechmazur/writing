<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira's silence and micro-choices with shutters reveal consistent traits under boy's grief pressure; Thomas's change earned through observed patterns. Minor telling in "she understood that some truths" dilutes interior contradiction slightly, but actions align with motives.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds from single shutter to full stories, culminating in CR via mirror handoff that reweights unspoken love with emotional cost in boy's tears and lighter walk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Puddles and shutters constrain reflections, charging final image; sensory details like wet planks under feet and lapping canal integrate purposefully, mirroring internal release without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grief vs. silent release signaled early, escalates via pattern deepening that narrows boy's options to acceptance; cost legible in dissolving "stone" in throat and foreclosed confession path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of action-love echoing beyond words emerges organically from shutter images shifting to hands reaching; final canal-stars whisper offers non-literal resonance reweighting silence's power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward calm patterns; voice texture in rhythmic syntax like "spiralingly calm movements—like water circling a drain in reverse" heightens lyric pressure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but figurative overload in teaching beat ("miniature constellations," "telescope into the past") risks coherence; no loops, strong propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of dental mirror and shutters transforms grief trope into fresh, object-driven lesson; risk of silent teaching pays off in inevitable mirror gift charging closure.</comment>
