<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elsa's motivation roots in concrete guilt over the fire, embodied in freezing tears and micro-choices like unbraiding per card holes; contradictory impulses (torment vs. purpose) act simultaneously, earning the final inheritance realization with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: card discovery initiates density increase in released names and transcriptions, culminating in on-page CR where "Elsa" revelation reconfigures preservation premise with emotional cost in frozen tears; orientation anchored in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ice sanctum constrains choices (fragments as investment material) and charges closure image (sweating walls as "tears of relief"); sensory selectivity (humming bronze, vibrating strands, aurora pulse) filters via caster's bias, evolving causally to dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve sounds post-guilt) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via card-rope match narrowing to ancestral "Elsa," forcing stance reconfiguration; cost legible in wept-frozen tears foreclosing self-torment path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transformation theme emerges organically from lost-wax analogy and rope-to-bells progression, resonant CR in final frame reweighting preservation without moralizing; earned via particulars like braided frequencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature in casting metaphors ("presence and absence intertwined"); rhythmic diction modulates intensity, perceptual bias selective (rope logic "intuitive" to her hands).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., unbraiding releases names while analogizing wax); varied rhythm, no loops, purposeful metaphors consistent without muddle in peak transcription beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hair-rope sound capture, punched-card notation, and bronze bells transforms preservation trope; risk in conceptual braid (Victorians to Arctic to Elsa) heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
