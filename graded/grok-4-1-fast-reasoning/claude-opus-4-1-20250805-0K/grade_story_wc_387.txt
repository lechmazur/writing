<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority rooted in sensory details like fingers on stones and net stitches as rebellion; motivation intensifies through philosophical recognition of entropy. Earned stasis in completion forecloses chaos with felt anonymity cost. Minor lack of contradictory impulses under pressure keeps it from 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to CR closure; orientation anchored by parapet and fireflies in first para. Final descent image reconfigures hidden efforts as eternal with ephemerality cost legible in "faintest impression in the dew." No causality breaks; pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (rain-scent, firefly paths, stone thrumming) filter through POV bias toward patterns; parapet constrains isolation and charges final whisper. Whisk as micro-setting reveals truths via tines fracturing moon, mirroring closure reprise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of revealing hidden patterns signaled early; textural escalation via firefly landing and hum cadence shift narrows to completion choice, charging anonymity cost in fisherman's ignorance. Agency in mending/whistling coherent under lens; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of anonymous efforts emerges organically from net, fireflies, stones; final image offers non-literal CR repricing beauty's fade without moralizing. Borderline echo in "this was the hidden pattern she cherished most" borders statement but anchors in prior images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close POV stable with perceptual signature of geometric patterns everywhere; rhythmic diction modulates meditative intensity. No head-hopping or elision; voice distinct via syntax echoing whisk tines and firefly pulse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (moon crescents, net geometry) taught early, paying off in hum resonance; varied rhythm propels to closure. Minor metaphor density in peak observation beat but coherent and non-obscuring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of net-mending as philosophy with firefly/moon patterns; risk in lyric meditation heightens stakes of entropy via demure acts. Transformation of tropes (vigilant isolation, fading light) feels inevitable in whispering stones reprise.</comment>
