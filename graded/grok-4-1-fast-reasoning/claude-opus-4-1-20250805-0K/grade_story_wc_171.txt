<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's transformation from vengeful killer to "operatively gentle" listener is embodied in her deviated opening speech and clipboard placement, earning the collective realization with contradictory impulses visible in her "broken music" laugh. Delegates apply secondary pressure via chimes and kneeling. Final renunciation of heroism feels compelled by her backstory-tilted micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of failures on clipboard builds to CR closure in delegates' personal recognitions and new light on wood, with conceptual cost of shattered narratives legible in "not the heroes" line. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene, no shards, lens taught early via red lights pulsing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Clipboard as micro-setting constrains choices (Mara sets it down; delegates touch it) and charges final image of gathering light. Suns' alignment blurs species visually, mirroring thematic damage without overt symbolism. Sensory hierarchy via Mara's tracing fingers and light through bones reflects her priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end hatred cycle) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via ritual deviation and clipboard exposure, narrowing to admission trade-off; cost felt in foreclosed righteousness during Theren's "abandon justice?" challenge and kneeling payoff. Agency in Mara's speech forces crystallization. One tightening suffices, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of redemption via admission emerges from clipboard's evolution (failures to potential connection) and suns' blur, reweighting hatred as shared damage without moralizing; final image offers non-literal answer in "painful and necessary and true." Subtext in silences and touches invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV on Mara with perceptual signature (tracing wood, interpreting chimes); lyrical rhythm modulates from patient to broken laugh under pressure. Dialogue subtextual (Theren's chime-song, Mara's direct challenge) advances via persuasion. No head-hopping, distinct idiolect in bone-singing vs. her prose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer image/action (e.g., "suns touched... corona bleeding" accelerates to blur). Zero loops, varied syntax/paragraphs; figurative coherence in celestial marriage motif serves closure without muddle. Ear-test passes on rhythmic builds to realizations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi diplomacy via memory-glass clipboard and blurring alien physiologies transforms forever-war trope; risk in ritual subversion heightens stakes organically. Clipboard's tree-origin ties premise inevitably to border-burning history, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
