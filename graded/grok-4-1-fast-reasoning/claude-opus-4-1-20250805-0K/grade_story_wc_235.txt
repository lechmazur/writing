<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in "jealous of every version... except the current one," earning final acceptance of chaos with embodied cost (earthbound feet, feral laugh).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; CR closure in "every Maya... spread their wings together. Then the moment passed" reconfigures fractured selves with legible conceptual cost of endless spiraling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Birch bark recurs to constrain choices (archive medium for fluid dreams), charging cabin window moment where forehead meets cold glass, mirroring internal tangle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distill chaos vs. temporal dissolution) tightens accumulatively via scroll densities to soaring Charged Poise; step outside forecloses linear certainty with felt resignation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image "documenting the dream of flying, unaware she was already soaring" resonantly reweights narrative-as-chaos premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice signature in time-fractured syntax ("would write them—had written them") modulates seamlessly to clipped closure rhythm, stable single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, zero loops; metaphors cohere (smoke spiraling) without muddle, propulsion peaks in "If she was going to soar, she might as well begin by falling."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bold nonlinear self-multiplicity via dream scrolls transforms time-loop trope; soaring convergence feels inevitable from early pattern.</comment>
