<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between vengeance and forgiveness act in scene via decision to burn documents; final renunciation earned by prior reflections on family chain, with embodied cost in blood-pricked thumb and confession. Interiority concrete and particular to calligrapher under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memories and realizations builds to CR closure in burning forgeries and writing confession, with legible cost in self-exposure; key's revelation tightens options precisely on altar moment. Orientation anchored immediately in sanctuary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary, aurora jade shadows, and dripping stalactites constrain solitary choice and charge final ash-like-snow image; sensory details (frost-glazed apertures, oil lamp) filtered through calligrapher's precision, mirroring internal erosion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to end treason chain signaled early, deepens via grandmother's marble message forcing renunciation; agency in burning documents forecloses forgery path with exposure cost felt in confession. Escalation coherent under accumulative lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of treason vs. truth emerges organically from particulars like forged vs. authentic hand; final confession image resonantly reweights chain motif without statement, embracing ambiguity of "greater game" exposure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in precision motifs (brush like weapons, inkstone); rhythmic modulation heightens realization at "characters appeared in the marble," diction biased to calligrapher's worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with lines like "ash that settled like snow" doing image/action/echo work; varied rhythm propels to closure, minor patterned repetition of "wisely enduring" and stalactites taught early as textural pulse without loop drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forger's precision in fantasy sanctuary transforms treason trope via blood-oath heirloom and key revelation; risk in quiet CR closure heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
