<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Performer’s blank face and monotone narration embody moral ambiguity and consistent traits, compelling Mrs. Chen’s micro-choice to touch the petal; internal conflict emerges in contradictory impulses of grief (clutching bouquet) versus lightness. Mrs. Chen’s endurance earns change without tidy epiphany. Voice distinction clear in performer’s flat announcements versus omniscient texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of whittling curls, turbine shadows, and narration builds to Charged Poise closure in Mrs. Chen’s practice (“Now I am becoming lighter”), reconfiguring grief with crumbling petal cost legible on-page. Orientation anchored early (farmhouse table, turbines by ~50 words). Single scene, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Turbines’ shadows and groan constrain atmosphere, mirroring internal states and charging final image (shadows as clock hands across table/bouquet/bird). Basswood and knife tactile, lived-in via whittling; bouquet evolves causally. Sensory hierarchy selective (visual shadows, whisper-roar).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lightness in grief) signaled early, tightens via cadence shift in performer’s pause (“Not happier. Lighter.”), narrowing to Mrs. Chen’s agency in practicing narration; cost felt in petal crumble foreclosing heavy grief. Accumulative pressure coheres without reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of weightless sorrow emerges organically from whittling/bouquet/bird, reweighted in final image of Mrs. Chen’s flat narration amid turbines; resonant non-literal answer (“emptiness became its own form of resistance”) avoids moralizing. Subtext in performer’s hush invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person focalization with perceptual bias (turbines/tShadows recurrent); performer’s dialogue natural, subtextual (“The wood grows lighter”), advances stakes. Rhythmic control in flat announcements versus prose texture; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm (short declarations amid description); purposeful repetition (“spin, spin, spin”) taught early, no loops or scaffolds. “Curls falling like a secret” vivid without muddle; minor figurative density in opening but pays off.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Happiness Mandate + whittling narration as grief loophole, performer’s ambiguity in turbine-shadowed hush; risk of quiet lyric closure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via lightness progression.</comment>
