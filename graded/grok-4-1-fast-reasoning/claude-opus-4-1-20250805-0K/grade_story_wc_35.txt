<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in two-choice dilemma, earned by gift's prior curse/blessing; "sandstorm, scouring her from inside" embodies flexible core under pressure without epiphany labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via memory density tightening to palm-on-pool RR (Charged Poise); cost legible in "water had turned clear as glass" after time-blurred subsumption.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tidal pools as "geometric ridges" and "carefully maintained eye[s]" constrain touch-tasting and charge closure's clear-water/stars shift; sensory hierarchy chef-specific via palate flood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to resolve haunting deepens via rain-awakened pavilion, agency in subsumption foreclosing walk-away with "trembled" cost; lens escalation unmistakable in contagion surge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Regret-to-acceptance emerges via transformed memories; feast promise and "wind... sounded like forgiveness" reweight premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity in digested grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("salt and sorrow") biases noticing, rhythmic modulation peaks in short, scouring sentences; stable close-3rd under stress, no elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dense propulsion with "coral... frozen scream" integrates sans muddle; minor figurative density in peak contained, no loops dull release image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Memory-tasting chef + coral relics synthesize fresh angle on haunting; subsumption risk heightens closure stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
