<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via shell's spiral and nexus sting; contradictory impulses (overthinking vs. revalue) act in scene, with Marcus's pressure earning relational shift. Minor slip in epiphanic "understood" at whisper lacking one micro-choice embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure: shell-sun pulses as invited presence, reweighting capture premise; nexus cooling legible as conceptual cost in final image. Orientation anchored early via nexus and twilight; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nexus and twilight constrain choices (dying embers "curious" only post-shell), charging final levitating shell-sun image. Sensory selection (pulsing veins, calcium curves) purposeful and POV-biased toward compression motifs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (density capture) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via shell placement and whisper reversal narrowing to relational witness; agency in recalibrations forecloses solitary formula path. Cost felt in "nexus finally cooled to darkness" post-success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of relational presence emerges organically via shell/nexus interplay and friend dynamic; final "small infinity, spiraling home" offers resonant CR reweighting without moral. No direct statements; ambiguity in replicability lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual bias (spiral geometry as presence cue); voice texture lyrical yet legible, modulating to charged poise at climax. Dialogue subtextual ("You're thinking too hard") pursues goals naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm supports accumulative propulsion; figurative language ("dying heart," "crystalline veins") patterned around compression without muddle. Minor repetition ("density," "presence") purposeful but risks loop in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy as relational recognition transforms trope of scientific quest; nautilus-shell sun feels inevitable from motifs, with risk-taking in lyric CR heightening stakes organically.</comment>
