<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cassia's expertise and motivation as light archaeologist compel her precise actions under time pressure, with embodied precision in jar use; mother's arrival forces relational micro-choice revealing daughter's longing. Minor slip in over-articulated epiphany ("truth is more beautiful") borders diagnostic but ties to prior skill demonstration without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup (descent/jar uncap) to revelation (portrait shift) to closure CR in final image of jar pulsing/Cassia exiting, reweighting her profession with felt cost of bearing painful truths. Orientation anchored early ("emerald-tiled walls... golden hour"); no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emerald station, moonbeams, and fading sunset constrain choices (time-sensitive application) and charge final silver patterns/moon-bright exit image. Sensory details (gleaming scales, moss stairs) filtered through Cassia's light-savvy POV, evolving causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reveal authentic emotion before golden hour ends) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via moonbeam reinterpretation narrowing to goodbye under joy; agency in pressing jar forecloses beauty-lie with mother's tears as legible cost charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth surpassing gilded beauty emerges implicitly through portrait shift and mother's relief; final line/images offer resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing, embracing complexity of hurtful truths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with luminous perceptual signature (light as "scales," "spirits"); dialogue natural/subtextual ("need to know why she left"), distinct voices; rhythm modulates from precise action to charged poise at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("moonbeams seep through molecular gaps"); varied rhythm/syntax supports ear test, minor figurative density in opening but purposeful/no muddle at closure revelation/beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical light-theft as emotional archaeology transforms trope of thief into poignant truth-revealer; risk in moonbeam mechanics pays off inevitably at portrait turn/closure image.</comment>
