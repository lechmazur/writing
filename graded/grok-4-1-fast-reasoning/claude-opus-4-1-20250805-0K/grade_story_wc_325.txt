<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elena's claustrophobia is embodied in "chest tightened" and "walls...squeeze tighter," driving contradictory impulses against her promise; final endurance to retrieve and carry the journal earns closure with felt annual cost. No safety-hedging; flaws compound under pressure without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelations via sensors build density to CR closure in final ascent image, reweighting promise with conceptual cost of eternal witness. Orientation anchored early ("submarine research station...beneath the Arctic shelf"); single scene coherent, no micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Flooded corridors and phase chamber constrain choices (tide forces ascent); recurring gold flecks charge final image as "constellations" and "heart that no longer beat." Sensory hierarchy (sonar pings, rebreather hiss) reflects Elena's professional bias, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfill promise amid claustrophobia/tide) signaled early, escalates via sensor revelations and chamber adjustment narrowing options; under Accumulative lens, density break at "digital cancer" deepens with agency-felt cost in annual return. One tightening sufficient, cost legible in "silences protected more than words."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unseen guardianship emerges organically from cable "neural pathways" and phase-trapped entity; final image reconfigures memory's cost without moralizing, resonant via gold-flecked journal tying particulars. No tidy binaries; ambiguity in world's ignorance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (claustrophobia biases spatial perception); rhythmic modulation peaks in short, urgent sentences during ascent ("The tide was turning"). Voice texture distinct, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "gold flecks...creating constellations" advances image/atmosphere); minor figurative density in opening ("neural pathways") borders overwrite but pattern-taught, no closure touch. No loops, clean propulsion, varied rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phase-ghosts and cable-devouring entity transforms sci-fi tropes via lived detail (molecular messages); risk in quiet CR closure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from promise/map setup.</comment>
