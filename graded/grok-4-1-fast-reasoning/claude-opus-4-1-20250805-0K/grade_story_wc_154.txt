<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's embodied ache and micro-choices under morphine (tracing scars, drawing bridge despite pain) reveal contradictory impulses, earning the coral handoff as purposeful endurance with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: prayer translations and cast additions build density to CR closure in coral whisper, reweighting survival with felt endurance cost on final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atrium mist and twilight glass constrain movement (shoulder pain in marker use) and charge final misters-veiled image, mirroring internal renewal through selective sensory filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Child's dance whisper deepens internal stake of survivor's purpose, forcing trade-off in drawing/writing amid gathering pressure; cost legible in throat tightening and phantom pains, but textural over sharp turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cast as collaborative language bridges theme of transcending loss, with coral's "grow slowly toward light" reweighting premise non-literally in final shared silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with morphine-hazed perceptual signature (loose tongue, coral convolutions) modulates rhythm purposefully; child's dialogue subtext advances via implication.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated images (neural-path coral); minor figurative density in ending metaphors purposeful for lyric closure, no loops dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cast-prayers as Pacific-specific healing map transforms hospital trope organically, with coral's ancient endurance risking lyric depth without gimmick.</comment>
