<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's gentle persuasion and vine-rooted wisdom drive micro-choices like salvaging the letter fragment and gesturing to the bench, earning the final endurance of hope amid loss. Daughter's arrival forces relational crucible with clear status shift. Minor epiphanic summary in "some mismatches were destined" slightly abstracts internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory density patterns mismatches toward Charged Poise closure in the bench scene, reconfiguring solitude into new arrival with felt cost of preserved incompleteness. Orientation anchored early in pavilion/vineyards. No lens ambiguity or shards beyond BRR allowance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Amber light and pavilion pool like wine in final image, charging reconfiguration; vines/blackberries constrain philosophical choices throughout. Sensory selection (light dissolving taillights, fluttering edge) reflects Marcus's perceptual bias. Spatial choreography coherent from bench to door creak.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of nurturing mismatched understanding signaled early via letter, tightens accumulatively through vine hybrids to daughter's revelation narrowing isolation. Agency in final gesture forecloses solitude with relational cost. Enters 8+ via option foreclosure but lacks deeper trade-off visibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vine crossings reweight mismatches from impossibility to "cultivate something new," resonant non-literal answer in final image without moralizing. Subtext in silences (Elena's whisper) and implications builds complexity. Thematic emergence organic from particulars, no Thematic Echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited Marcus with vine-infused perceptual signature ("boundaries are just invitations"); dialogue distinct (daughter's directness vs. his subtlety). Rhythm modulates from reflective to charged "uncorked." Minor filter in "he'd possessed something then" but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "taillights dissolving into dusk" advances atmosphere/plot); varied rhythm passes ear test. Figurative density overwrites slightly in opener ("honey crystallizing"), docking prose propulsion. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vineyard mismatches-to-hybrids premise transforms trope via specific wine/Keats parallels, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk in reflective accumulative structure heightens quiet closure without gimmick. No derivative templates; fresh synthesis of philosophy and terroir.</comment>
