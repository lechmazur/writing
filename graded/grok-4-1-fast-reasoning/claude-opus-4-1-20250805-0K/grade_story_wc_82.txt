<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei's craftiness roots motivation, shown in bending glass to dream-gems and micro-choices like grinding anguish, earning change in incorporating gems into lanterns with embodied cost of peace amid pain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via polishing progression to "not memory but possibility" discovery, delivering RR/CR closure in thousandth crane with detachment cost legible in final transformation image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating tea garden and looming glass basilica constrain crafting choices, with woven-moonlight bridges and crystal bells mirroring ascent/descent; lanterns' "dancing shadows like daughters" charges closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-light emerges organically from gem/lantern particulars, with final "shadows that danced like living things" reweighting ascent/descent without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with lyrical perceptual signature in light/memory noticing; sparse dialogue like Master Shen's observation carries subtext without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Shadow-plague dream-gems and grief-cranes synthesize fresh craft-transformation premise, with future-vision turn growing inevitably from polishing particulars.</comment>
