<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions (gag yet inhale deeply) and micro-choices (fingering clasp, reading reverse) reveal contradictory fascination/repulsion; final confrontation earned by prior nightly pulls. Minor diagnostic slip ("Fear was lonely") at climax revelation slightly undercuts immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with paradox/density buildup to CR closure: reverse reading triggers projection, shattering Fear's grip with conceptual cost (carrying transformed Fear). Orientation anchored early; no breaks in legible causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mold/sweet rot/ozone constrain entry and pulse to charge climax; mirrors as recurring object project death, darkening at end recharges prior curse. Sensory hierarchy (repulsive smells amid glow) biases via Mara's allure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbosom Fear's secret) signaled early, escalates via pulses/projection/deepening (lonely child reveal) under Accumulative lens; agency in reverse reading narrows options, cost legible in clasp containment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (Fear craves understanding) emerges from paradox/events/child-form shift, final image (photos now show joys) offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting mirrors/clasp without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (warmth fascination); sparse dialogue goal-driven (Cornelius urges specifics). Rhythmic control modulates to charged poise at "Break it."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines like "ruby eye pulsing in rhythm") propels; varied rhythm passes read-aloud. Minor metaphor density ("silk through broken glass") in opening fits pattern without muddling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Fear as weeping child starved for understanding, tricked via reverse paradox in cursed funhouse; risk-taking paradox mechanic transforms haunting trope organically to CR.</comment>
