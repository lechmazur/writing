<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Characterization excels in embodied interiority and genetic compulsion driving isolation and purpose; contradictory destruction-creation impulses act in tender fragment handling. Final keeper reconfiguration earned via scarred hands unifying past. Minor slip: occasional diagnostic phrasing like "analytically intuitive mind" borders label-speak but anchors early without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of revelations tightens to CR closure in final tapestry touch, reweighting arsonist identity with conceptual cost of stolen legacy. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (archive beneath Prague). One deepening via reconstruction suffices; backstory shards legible under BRR.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archive's copper air, limestone corridors, fragile textiles constrain tender handling and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (taste/smell primacy) reflects analytical intimacy. Micro-setting (fragments/shelves) mirrors internal patterns without overt symbolism. Evolves causally as reconstruction alters space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue woven promise) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via trail decoding to reconstruction tightening options. Agency in pattern-seeing/memorializing forecloses arsonist past with isolation cost felt in "always worked alone." Price legible in scarred hands' unification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of imperishable truth emerges organically from forgery-burning to weaving revival; final image non-literally answers destruction-as-creation without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like UV-map scratches reweights genetic memory. Counter-reading (terrorism glorified) lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (pattern-detection bias, smoke-dreams idiom); voice modulates rhythmically from volcanic fury to tender cadence. Prose texture distinct in fiber/memory fusion. No dialogue; compression of trail taught early, pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines, but "volcanic tenderness" thrice (including closure) creates minor loop (-0.4); metaphor coherence strains slightly in "lava cooling into new earth." Rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion strong to ending image. No filter stacks or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist-as-genetic-guardian via woven nanotechnology premise; trail of vandalized art transforms trope into inevitable pattern-play. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmick; irreplaceable fiber-history angle inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
