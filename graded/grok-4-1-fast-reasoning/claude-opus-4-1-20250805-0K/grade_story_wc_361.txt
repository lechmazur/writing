<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Jittery hands evolve from flaw to essential resonance, enabling Convergence and earned transformation; contradictory nervousness propels the climax choice to hold pendant amid intensifying vibration. Interiority embodied in trembling fingers matching frequency, revealing character under pressure. Final reconfiguration as "living bridge" forecloses jittery doubt with felt responsibility cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vibration density builds to ghostly Convergence then knowledge flood, reconfiguring options from delivery to resurrection. On-page Charged Poise closure in final pendant vibration and smile, with conceptual cost of inherited responsibility legible in "she carried more than relics." Single scene anchors early, no orientation debt; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway and magnetic hum constrain testing ritual, narrowing to sympathetic vibration trigger; selective sensory hierarchy (iridescent wings, electromagnetic song) reflects courier priorities. Recurring pendant-as-micro-setting charges final image, mirroring internal resonance. Atmosphere tensions myth boundary without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax relic wonder) signaled early, accumulates via intensification to Convergence; tremor enables deepening, narrowing routine delivery to transformative bridge with visible cost of endless resonance duty. Agency in sustaining hold amid ghosts tests commitment under Accumulative lens. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of routine-to-revelation emerges organically from relic-as-seed particulars, reweighted in Luminari ritual and knowledge flood; final image answers via pendant's subtle vibration collapsing time. Subtext in mentor's echoed words implies without stating. Resonance from flawed tremor enabling encounters avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: relic-focused noticing (wings "remembering flight") biases toward frequencies. Voice texture modulates rhythmically with intensity, from tentative adjustment to empowered descent; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure image. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "trembled as if remembering flight" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies for aurora build to fade. Minor repetition of "vibration" purposeful for resonance motif, no loops or scaffolds. Slight overwriting in metaphor strings during peak (ghosts/harmonics) borders muddle but integrates.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frequency-matched relics germinating past encounters transforms courier trope via flaw-as-key; risk in quiet Accumulative closure heightens conceptual stakes. Non-obvious angle on artifacts as living bridges feels inevitable from ridgeway setup. Bold sci-fi lyricism commits to premise without retreat.</comment>
