<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation roots deeply in his sound-collection habit, earning his transformation via Elena encounter; interiority embodied in tears and jar-labeling reveals particular flaws without safety-hedging. Minor epiphanic tidiness at "sudden clarity" line avoids contradiction but lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via jar collection pattern holds through beach search shards to CR closure in final jar image, reweighting solitude with purpose at undeniable relational cost; orientation anchored by ~50 words, one tightening at Elena suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Music box and jars as micro-settings constrain choices (wrapping in shirt, new jar) and charge final image; sensory details like "salt-stiffened blanket" selectively mirror internal wistfulness through POV bias, vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transformation signaled via "translator between generations," tightens accumulatively at Elena's recognition, forcing endurance of marginality with visible cost in purposeful return to loft; agency in persistent search coheres pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Gleaned redemption emerges organically from discards reclaimed (box, stories), final jar laughter-mingled melody offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting isolation without moralizing; complexity lingers in bittersweet harmony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (sounds as poems) stable in single POV, modulates rhythm under emotional peaks; Elena's dialogue natural/subtextual ("time to forgive") distinguishes idiom, advances closure without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm/syntax, purposeful poetic figures like "frosted glass" cohere without muddle; minor overwriting in repeated "melody" phrasing near Elena beat docks slightly, but no loops obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-jars as redemption archive transforms vagrant trope via specific beach mosaic; risk in accumulative shards heightens stakes, core premise commits without retreat.</comment>
