<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Thomas's contradictory impulses—skepticism evolving to "forgiving awareness"—act in scene via nest-weaving micro-choice, earning final tooth return with relational cost. Elara's presence forces status shift from loss to acceptance. Voices distinct in idiom and perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of garden images and revelations reconfigures certainty into transformation. Closure as Charged Poise in tooth press and Elara's departure, cost legible in "she was purely the sister... Then she stepped back." Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden's impossible blooms and fountain handprints constrain choices, mirroring internal states and charging final image where "jasmine bloomed out of season." Sensory selection POV-biased to tactile (nest, silk) and visual shifts (Elara's eyes). Spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fractured sibling bond signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Elara's Council mention and Mother's knowledge reveal, narrowing to acceptance with cost of her departure. Agency in Thomas's "I know" and tooth return forecloses restoration fantasy. One deepening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformation over restoration emerges organically from bone/nest imagery shifting meaning at end ("broken things learned to grow differently"). Final humming song offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in silences and gestures like handprint touch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in bone-architecture noticing; diction/rhythm modulate from reflective to charged ("gap-toothed and giggling, chasing fireflies"). Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (Elara probes Council, Thomas deflects). No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "cleft in his certainty had become a doorway" advances character/theme/prose). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative purposeful (water finding level). Propulsion peaks in closure image without overwriting.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling folklore with bone-setting innovation; "healing ground for creatures caught between" transforms tropes via shrewd innocence. Risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off in inevitable-feeling CR closure.</comment>
