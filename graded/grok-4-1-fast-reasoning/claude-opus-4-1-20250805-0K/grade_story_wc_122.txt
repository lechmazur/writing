<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in bone/teeth vibrations; motivation rooted in prior accident and experiments compels setup and trance. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene prevents 9+; change feels earned via thawing without overt conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reversed vibrations builds to CR closure in final needle image with conceptual cost of transformed perception. Orientation anchored by ~50 words at entrance; single scene coherent, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cavern acoustics and stone floor constrain tactile choices, charging final pocketed needle; sensory hierarchy tactile/pressure-focused via POV bias. Micro-setting (broken needle, phonograph) evolves to polish tip, mirroring internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeat numbness) signaled early, escalates via vibration density under accumulative lens to thawing reversal; agency in palms-to-floor and endurance costs emotional scar tissue peeling. Cost legible in acceptance of marrow-music.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reverse/silence-to-music emerges organically via vibrations and final earth-rhythm image reweighting premise without moralizing. Resonant CR answers numbness via particulars; no tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with tactile perceptual signature ("fingers reading the air's subtle pressure"); rhythmic modulation builds trance density. Prose texture distinct, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("unwound time... scar tissue") slightly muddles peak trance without harming closure. No loops; purposeful poetic diction fits voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of backward records/bone-music transforms deafness trope; risk in lyric vibration-focus heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via needle's polish in dying light.</comment>
