<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's contradictory impulses—wildness in her chest versus sculpted patience—act simultaneously in the breathing moment and rod placements, earning her final alert exhaustion with visible cost on the basalt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as rod placements build density to the viaduct's pulse (DC/RR), with conceptual cost legible in "Freedom always felt like falling at first"; orientation anchored early in basalt and frozen lake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Basalt cracks constrain rod placements and perimeter walk, while frozen lake charges final reflective image, mirroring transformation; sensory selection (vibrations, humming) reflects Kira's mapper bias under urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of revolution tightens accumulatively through twelve sanctuaries reveal and field shift, driven by agency in circuits; cost felt in exhaustion and distant panic, charging poise at dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Patient revolution emerges organically from water/ice/stone motifs shifting to viaduct's new song, with final lake-sky reflection offering resonant non-literal answer to transformation's softness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in lunar/magnetic sensations; voice modulates rhythmically from wild urge to refined purpose, with Tomás' whisper natural and goal-pursuing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in rod-placement beats with varied syntax; no loops or artifacts, purposeful metaphors like "molecule by molecule" integrate without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geomagnetic viaduct and moon-tracked polarity shift transforms revolution trope into geological patience, with risk-taking in quiet closure heightening inevitability.</comment>
