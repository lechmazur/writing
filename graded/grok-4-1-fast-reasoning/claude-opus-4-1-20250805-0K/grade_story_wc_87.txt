<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's embodied laugh at the seal and sudden teaching offer earn credible change from prior regret-driven isolation; Sarah's secondary pressure via knowing smile reinforces without dominating. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "align his heart and actions" edges from full immersion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via pole counts to charged poise closure at "I want to start teaching," with compass reprise as felt cost of accepting brokenness. Orientation anchors firmly by launch description; single scene holds without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Utility poles constrain choices (e.g., pole 19 stop mirroring rescue failure) and charge final "sentinel" image as unconventional constellation. Sensory details like salt-sprayed compass and fog lift filter through navigational bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Grief-as-navigation stake signaled early via compass/flask tightens accumulatively at pole 19 reflection into seal-induced thaw; teaching decision crystallizes stance with humility cost. No reversals needed; density reweights isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Broken tools finding meaning emerges organically from compass/poles progression, reweighted in final pocket/beach image without moralizing. Resonant ambiguity in "broken things can still point toward something meaningful" lingers via counter-reading of failure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with navigational perceptual signature (e.g., "eyes kept gravitating toward the horizon"); dialogue subtextual, Sarah's "merrily melancholic" idiom distinct from Marcus's spareness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm in paddle beats; minor "broken" synonym churn across reflections doesn't obscure seal laugh climax. Clean syntax, no loops or artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Poles-as-stars synthesis transforms redemption trope through lived specifics; risk of utility pole system heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
