<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's insomnia curse roots motivation in embodied details like trembling hands and aching teeth; interiority particular via undertaker lens on books as bodies. Earned change at "chased stillness...stopped running" forecloses escape with cost of permanent guardianship. Minor slip: archetypal weariness lacks deeper contradictory impulses in peak descent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from package to library transformation; orientation anchored early ("Silas Crow's mortuary on a Tuesday"). Closure as RR (Earned Stasis) lands on-page with conceptual cost in "silence bloomed like funeral flowers," reweighting insomnia stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Underwater library constrains via "preserved air" and floating books, charging closure image of mausoleums from coral/memory. Sensory selectivity (brine reek, lens hum, murk) reflects undertaker urgency; micro-setting (grief bubble) enables descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rest vs. insomnia) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through librarians' "black holes of exhaustion" deepening to revitalization. Agency in rituals forecloses options with time-cost ("months, or perhaps minutes"); visible price shapes final stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rest for drowned knowledge emerges organically from particulars like saltwater rituals; final image "dead cities sang lullabies" offers resonant CR reweighting premise without moral. No sermonizing, ambiguity in "impossible spaces" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with undertaker perceptual signature (grief as "breathable"); rhythm modulates from tense descent to poised closure. Librarians' whisper "Every story needs an ending" carries subtext; purposeful surreal compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "bubble of breathable grief" does triple duty); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful ("rainbow ghosts," "funeral flowers") without muddle in peak transformation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of lighthouse lens as "prism...to refract consciousness" via mortuary craft in civilization morgue; transforms tropes (cursed descent, librarians) through lived detail. Risky surrealism heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at guardian resolution.</comment>
