<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eclectic pacifist traits shown concretely through radios, bowls, and silence catalog, driving precise micro-choices under deadline pressure; final empathy realization earned via grandmother's frequency-parallel entries, with embodied reverence in touching pages.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as frequency scans build density to clasp's song (RR/Charged Poise); on-page closure via diary opening and fireworks pause reconfigures recovery stake with patience cost, anchors clear by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Workshop's equipment constrains tuning and harmonizes in climax; tin roof's starlight and sensory hum/crinkle filter through Mara's sonic bias, charging final fireworks silence image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock via anticipation frequency) signaled early tightens accumulatively through surgeon's fine-tuning reversal; New Year's deadline forces trade-off, with legible cost in foreclosed force over patience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Silence-as-empathy emerges implicitly from scans and diary's "path to empathy... listening to what isn't said"; fireworks gap offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting silences without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with sonic perceptual signature ("clasp sang—actually sang"); rhythmic diction modulates from hum to orchestral peak, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action/imagery (e.g., "static crackled like distant applause"); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops, metaphors coherent in sonic orchestra.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Resonance-lock premise synthesizes Victorian tech, silences, and New Year's pause into fresh inheritance arc; bold sonic harmony at clasp opening heightens stakes organically.</comment>
