<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied in trembling fingers and stirring gift, with micro-choices like accepting the knife revealing values; motivation rooted in grandmother intensifies accumulatively to compel pocketing the map. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9; competent struggle without deep flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layers of revelation build density to CR closure in "painted their own stars" realization and pocketing the map-as-tool, with legible conceptual cost of unfastening protected histories. Orientation anchored early in market/stall; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Canvas as recurring object constrains scraping choice and charges final map image; sensory selection (pentimento glints amid bubbling vials) filtered through Mira's gift bias narrows to revelation. Market sway subtly guides infinite moment without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor histories via fragment) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through paint layers revealing coordinates/testimonies, narrowing to fog-projection agency; cost felt in "carried more than she'd climbed up with," charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of translation living in refracted spaces emerges organically from pentimento layers and painted stars; final fog-dance image offers resonant reconfiguration of overlooked voices without moralizing, reweighting grandmother's words.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in "spaces between languages"; dialogue subtextual (Valdric's whisper confirms sight). Rhythmic diction modulates to lyrical expansion in "eternal instant," heightening pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "each removed flake revealed more" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies naturally, no loops/artifacts, figurative integration like "ghosted layer" coherent and propulsive to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pentimento as encoded map and light-refracted languages transforms hidden-history trope; risk in "painted stars only in art" feels inevitable, heightening stakes through irreplaceable visual linguistics.</comment>
