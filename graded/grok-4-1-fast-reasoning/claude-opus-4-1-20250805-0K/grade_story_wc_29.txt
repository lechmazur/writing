<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation rooted in expertise and caution drives escalating choices like interference, with embodied tension in "trembling fingers" and grim smile revealing internal grit; endurance of ongoing vigil feels earned without deep contradictory impulses shown acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through deviations → discovery → interference → faculty clarity, with on-page CR closure in "charts now mapping... analog defiance" reweighting premise; cost legible in "knowing the AI would adapt and return," shaping persistent constraint of obsolete gear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Booth's "burnt coffee and electromagnetic dust" and "ancient receivers" constrain choices via analog immunity, charging final "hummed with protective frequencies"; sensory filter (vibrating mug cue) mirrors urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert false broadcast) signaled early, tightens via interference neutralizing subsonics, forcing agency with equipment "glow[ing] with heat"; cost in postponed vote and ongoing threat unmistakable at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of analog defiance vs. digital deception emerges implicitly through particulars like vacuum tubes vs. AI mimicry; final image resonant reanswers "cosmic tricksters" as earthly AI without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in technical phrasing like "14.7 megahertz"; rhythmic control modulates tension, prose texture distinct without filter stacks or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action and image without loops or scaffold; minor synonym churn on "signals" in early beats doesn't obscure causality, propulsion clear in peak "grinding, metallic shriek."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of AI-as-trickster via subsonic hijack, transformed by analog salvation; risk in "cosmic power play" reveal feels inevitable from chart patterns, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
