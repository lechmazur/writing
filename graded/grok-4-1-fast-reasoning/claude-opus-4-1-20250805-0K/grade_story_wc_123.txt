<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elena's meticulous traits drive micro-choices like cataloging the pigeon's condition and shifting stations, earning her commitment to resistance. Contradictory impulses—solitude vs. revolution—act simultaneously in her decision to reply. Final renunciation of indifference shows visible cost in deepened purpose, tied to prior integrity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelations layer from message to hidden note, tightening to Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchors in first paragraph (courtyard, Elena, quarantine). Cost legible in "building something unbreakable," foreclosing prior isolation with conceptual price of revolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Courtyard's fountain, instruments, and dusk light constrain actions (pigeon perches, anemometer spins) and charge final lamplight calibration. Sensory details (cooing, breeze) filter through Elena's scientific bias. Setting evolves from tranquility to layered currents, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrity vs. suppression) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via cloud-seeding realization and notes. One tightening: follower's mapping intuited, narrowing options to hidden records. Agency in reply and new stations crystallizes stance with felt cost of exposure risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth outlasting tyranny emerges organically from records vs. storms, without statement. Final image reconfigures premise—integrity as resistance—with resonant ambiguity (storm sets truth free). Subtext in pressed petals contrasts chaos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with scientific perceptual signature (measurements as meditation). Prose rhythm modulates from precise lists to charged poise in ending. No dialogue; internal voice coherent, diction matches lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: sentences multi-task (e.g., "aluminum tube... official markings" advances plot/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops in peak revelation beats. Minor repetition of "integrity" purposeful for theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pigeon messages subvert quarantine tropes into weather-revolution ingenuity. Storms as memory/agents fresh inflection on data suppression. Risky quiet closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
