<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (Chen's fear vs Mira's embrace) act simultaneously in dialogue; final nod earned by patient micro-choices like cicada handling, revealing values hierarchy with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of pool analogies builds to CR closure in Chen's nod and cicada simile, reweighting knowledge of time's burden with conceptual cost legible in "The weight of that knowledge..."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pools and grotto constrain conversation (e.g., star-mirror pool gestures revelation) and charge final image of creatures in transition; sensory integration (waves, bioluminescence) mirrors thematic texture without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (re-engaging Chen) signaled early, deepens via his foreseeing revelation narrowing options; Mira's agency in tangential persuasion forces stance crystallization with felt cost of knowledge's weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transitions as charged pauses emerges from particulars (cicada, crab, plankton); final hermit crab image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting endings without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Mira's naturalist observations (e.g., crab's angles); dialogue subtextual and idiomatic, pursuing persuasion; rhythmic control modulates with revelation intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density (e.g., wave rearranging "topography of their conversation") propels without loops; varied rhythm and precise verbs integrate figuration purposefully, passing read-aloud test flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal ecology and temporal philosophy via cicada/pools; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative design heightens stakes through irreplaceable naturalist inflections.</comment>
