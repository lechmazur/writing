<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via touch (fingers tracing channels) and micro-choices (loose screw reveals values hierarchy), with Mrs. Huang applying relational pressure; minor diagnostic reflection ("reading between lines") slightly abstracts peak motivation without full contradiction in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure (loose screw integrates damage, reconfiguring repair as honest continuation); cost legible in "functional yet free to remember," orientation anchored early in shop/Mara/morning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fog and water channels constrain perception/choices (glimpsed approach, carved paths mirror grief) and charge final image (fog patterns like ultrasound); sensory hierarchy touch/sound-dominant fits POV loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate grief via repair) signaled early, textural deepening in screw reveal/dialogue narrows to renunciation (perfect fit rejected); cost felt in imperfect rhythm, agency in deliberate looseness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of repair as integration emerges organically from water paths/grief flow, resonant CR in final screw as "midwife delivering time anew" reweights loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Consistent close-3rd perceptual signature (touch/sound bias post-smell loss), dialogue subtext-rich ("It wanted to remember"); rhythmic modulation supports lyric texture without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but minor paraphrase loops ("fog pressing/transformed/soften edges") and repeated "trembling calm" dull propulsion slightly in opening; closure image propels cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost smell/water clocks/grief translation transforms repair trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive pays off in inevitable-feeling closure image.</comment>
