<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in Elara's "somber marvel settled into her bones," revealing character through teaching choices under alien marvel pressure; micro-choices with chain link earn worldview shift. Minor idealization limits contradictory impulses to skepticism resolution only.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from lesson to alien demo to final CR at window, where chain link reprise reconfigures navigation premise with conceptual cost of transformed understanding. Orientation anchored early in descent; single scene fits scope without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Chain link as micro-setting constrains teaching choices and charges final image of Elara turning it, connecting past mariners to cosmic future; benthic pressures and bioluminescence filter through Elara's priorities, mirroring internal unfolding. Sensory hierarchy vivid yet selective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating by starlight tightens accumulatively via Torres question, chain demo, exercises, and alien hologram, forcing wonder-stance crystallization with worldview cost felt in final bones-settling pressure. One deepening suffices; agency in Elara's guidance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of stars-within-depths emerges organically from lesson particulars, culminating in resonant final image repricing horizons without moralizing; alien's "depth and distance are illusions" echoes subtextually through chain link reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable Elara POV with perceptual signature on pressures and harmonics; dialogue natural/subtextual (Torres curiosity, alien whale-song crystals) advances plot distinctly. Rhythmic prose modulates marvel without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., chain resonating Crab Nebula matches holograms); varied rhythm supports accumulative build, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image of chain weight connecting eras.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ocean depths as stellar lens via chain link transforms navigation trope organically; risk in crystalline aliens and edge geometry feels inevitable, charging CR without gimmickry.</comment>
