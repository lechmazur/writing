<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mae's motivation rooted in vivid past-life memory compels micro-choices like tear application and photo release; embodied emotions (copper taste, breathing shifts) show contradiction between seeking and giving. Final renunciation earned by escalating interior pull, foreclosing capture-path with felt emptiness. Minor slip: ghost's guidance slightly shortcuts Mae's agency at door threshold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sparks density builds to door reveal via tear/breathing; closure as Conceptual Repricing when photos dissolve, reweighting premise with cost of personal release legible in "empty and full" image. Orientation anchored early (viaduct, camera, sparks). One tightening suffices; no lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (wisteria blooms concealing door, hum frequency) constrain choices and mirror internal unveiling; camera as micro-setting charges final image. Twilight narrowing perception fits urgency; POV bias (phosphorescent trail) integrates seamlessly. Environment evolves causally, guiding arch-specific action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find unused love repository) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via tear/breathing to release-act; agency in exposing plates forecloses taking-path with on-page cost (solitudes dissolved). Pressure coheres without reversal overload; ghost complicates via guidance. Minor abstractness in stakes legibility pre-climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of giving unused love emerges organically from sparks/photos dissolution, resonant non-literal answer in viaduct glowing brighter and Mae's trailing sparks. Complexity in healing via grief-offering avoids tidy moral; final image reweights seeking-to-giving arc. No direct statements or false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature (inverted world unveiling concealed) biased and selective; voice texture modulates with intensity (shallow breaths to steady exhale). Purposeful compression taught early pays off at closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion (short sentences in revelations); high density integrates action/image without loops. Minor figurative density in peak (ribbons like silk scarves) purposeful but borders overwriting, not obscuring closure. Clean mechanics, strong verbs propel to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera obscura as love-unveiler, sparks/pilgrimage, tear-catalyst transforms tropes; risk in foggy-lucid surrealism heightens stakes coherently. Inevitable hindsight from memory-seed to release; no derivatives, bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
