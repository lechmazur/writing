<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as quietly driven cartographer compels feverish mapping and final hatch decision with felt cost of isolation; contradictory fear vs. need to know acts in scene via trembling hand and ignored warning. Minor slip in embodied contradiction under peak dread, but prior micro-choices earn closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via revelation density (whistle silence → crack translation → inverted spirals), culminating in CR closure: Mira slips through hatch amid turtle groan, reweighting city/world premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by ~100 words; one tightening via crack message forecloses safe paths.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Turtle shells and watchers constrain choices (rusted gate forces hatch) and charge final image (cracks spreading, groan as shells move). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (spirals over salt air); setting evolves causally with cracks and awakening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher expedition → uncover watchers' truth) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via crack's inverted pattern narrowing options to venture out. Agency in translation and hatch slip; cost legible in "do not follow" defiance and looming city change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of patterns as guide/warning emerges organically from spiral mappings inverting to peril, resonating in final image of mapping "whatever came next" amid awakening—reweights questioning's cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (mathematical spirals patterning everything); rhythmic prose modulates from heavy sunlight dread to geological groan. No head-hopping; diction biased to cartographer's precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in opening spirals ("prayer unanswered") purposeful for pattern motif, not muddling closure groan.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of turtle-city premise, spiral warnings, awakening statues transforms tropes via inverted patterns; risk in quiet CR ending heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early mappings.</comment>
