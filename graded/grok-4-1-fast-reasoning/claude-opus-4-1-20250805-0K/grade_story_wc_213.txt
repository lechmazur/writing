<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied sensations (vibrations in bones) and contradictory impulses between instruments and ancestral listening; final bell-pull earned by prior micro-choices like rejecting the switch. Grandmother's teaching anchors motivation without excess reflection. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to Charged Poise closure in bell-pull and final image, with legible cost (villages saved, Mara isolated). Orientation anchored by para 1; single scene causality tight. No slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains pivotal choice (bell rope proximity vs. distant switch) and charges closure (ice crystals chiming like bells). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (humidity shifts, stone hum); evolves causally with storm. Micro-setting mastery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (credible warning) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven deepening (bell over sirens), reweighting under Accumulative lens with on-page cost (trusting whispers forecloses doubt). Escalation legible in bone-felt pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of listening vs. noise emerges via particulars (whispers to screams, bell then sirens); final image reconfigures old/new wisdom without statement. Resonance from conflict, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (subtle shifts in air, silence preceding screams); rhythmic modulation builds hush to peal. No elision or head-hopping; voice particular to listener's idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; purposeful repetition of "hush" taught as pattern. Minor overwriting in opening weather details doesn't dull closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tech tradition in high-altitude zero hour; risk of quiet avalanche climax pays off in resonant hush-to-chime reconfiguration. No derivative echoes.</comment>
