<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Characters deeply particular through perceptual biases like linking dead languages to building murmurs; relationship crucible forces vulnerability in seal-sharing beat. Minor abstract emotion ("something neither quite acknowledged") lacks embodied contradiction, but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via revelation density to Charged Poise closure ("Elara started the first lesson"); cost felt in mutual exposure of "living memory." Orientation anchored early; single scene seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rooftop garden/meteor shower charges revelations (bright meteor illuminates Marcus's admission); building hums constrain intimacy below. Selective sensory weave (steam like incense) mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sharing building-hearing gift) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via admissions to "Teach me"; agency in seal handoff forecloses isolation with relational cost. Minor abstract stakes early slightly dulls visceral feel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of structures as "agreed upon lies" emerges via particulars like mason's wife palmprint; final image reconfigures premise without moralizing. Subtext in oblique dialogue enriches ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with Elara's perceptual signature (architecture as dialects); dialogue subtextual ("What did it say?" probes gently). Rhythmic control modulates to charged poise at end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy dialogue amid lyrical lines); no loops. Minor mixed metaphors ("silver threads," "midnight recitation") in peak don't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise of "structural linguistics" transforms architecture trope into fresh synthesis; seal's *Veritas Structura* inflects irony organically. Risky lyric build pays off in inevitable teacher-student pivot.</comment>
