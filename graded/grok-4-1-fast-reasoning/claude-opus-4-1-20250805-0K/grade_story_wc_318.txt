<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's mournful eagerness embodies contradiction, shown in his "half-dance, half-prayer" conducting that compels the restorative act with felt emotional cost. Interiority particularizes via grandmother's lullabies and prior conductor's lesson, driving micro-choices without stock epiphanies. Final endurance of monthly returns forecloses isolation, earned by backstory loss tilting present stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: blower activation builds density to echo emergence in Hendricks house, culminating in RR closure via sustained note and family laughter with ongoing cost of "necessary hauntings." Single scene coheres without shards; orientation anchors early (tunnel, Maple Street, three years post-accident). No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tunnel's curved walls and vents constrain performance, multiplying notes into "breathing entity" that charges final exhale image. Sensory wind, creaks, dust motes filter through Marcus's perceptual bias, mirroring grief's "sediment." Micro-setting (blowers' cords as "teeth") evolves tactilely, grounding fantastical rules in lived aeriation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore laughter) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via blower chorus swelling to vent-transmitted giggles, tightening with insistent lullabies that reweight household silence. Agency in conducting forecloses failed aeration path; cost legible in family's swallowed laughs resurfacing. Minor abstractness in "limestone pores" slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of echo-preserved joy emerges organically from particulars like Bobby's sevenfold laugh and hopscotch creaks, reweighting grief via tunnel's "aeration" without statement. Final image of clinking cords offers non-literal resonance on hauntings' necessity, embracing ambiguity of persistent loss. No moralizing; counter-reading (joy's impermanence) lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: Marcus notices "gleaming teeth" and "breathing entity," modulating rhythmically under performance stress. Prose texture distinct in musical syntax; no head-hopping despite family glimpses via effects. Compression of echo mechanics taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene propulsion: short crescendo sentences build to sustained thirteen-second note. Density high, metaphors consistent (choir, symphony) without muddle, though minor figurative density in peak ("fingers of wind") risks overwrite. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; final line recharges cords motif propulsively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise ingeniously synthesizes mundane leaf blowers into echo-restoring choir, transforming grief tropes via specific limestone mechanics and prior conductor lore. Risky musical conceit heightens stakes organically; pull-cord reprise feels inevitable, no derivative echoes. Bold "true haunting" subverts ghost archetype without gimmickry.</comment>
