<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between forceful picking and patient listening act through gear assembly and mirror reflections; final renunciation of haste earned by past failure's cost shown in village darkness below. Interiority particular to locksmith via tumblers and rhythms. Flaw of ambition complicates choices without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: prophecy scraps and gear assembly densify to CR closure where final image of descent reweights premise with conceptual cost of prior haste. Anchors clear by para 1; one tightening via mirrors frosting over narrows to rhythmic insight. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mirrors constrain realization by reflecting life stages, charging final transparent walls showing village/vault. Sensory selective (frost tactile, hush auditory) through locksmith bias; ice-slick floor and spires tactile in ascent/descent. Evolving details mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn repair rhythm post-failure) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fragments to gear hum and village view, forcing stance shift with felt cost of endless winter. Agency in patient configuration forecloses forceful path; moral calculus between ambition and craft legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patient repair emerges organically from gear dance and mirror memories, resonant CR in descent image reweighting locks as conversation without moral state. Particulars like driftwood edges and stellar frost anchor complexity; ambiguity in prophecy invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (mechanisms "sing," tumblers felt) stable in close third; rhythm modulates from hushed ascent to humming crescendo. Compression in reflections taught early, legible at insight; diction controlled, locksmith-idiomatic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., gear interlocking reveals grandfather's obsession); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in metaphors (silk hush, driftwood edges) consistent fantasy lyricism, coherent without muddle in peak assembly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eclipse locksmith, star-gears, memory-mirrors transforms prophecy trope via rhythmic repair insight; risk in abstract library physics pays off in charged CR. Irreplaceable particulars like lotus-eclipse pattern feel inevitable hindsight.</comment>
