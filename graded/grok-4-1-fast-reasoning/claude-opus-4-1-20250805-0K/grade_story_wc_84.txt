<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kira's perpetual surprise enables openness to discoveries, embodied in "breath caught" and chest resonance, but her shift to epiphany lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, feeling slightly tidy at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered discoveries (drone anomaly to thermal trails to matrices); CR closure lands on-page with conceptual cost in "filling the missing pieces she hadn't known were empty," reweighting belonging.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory walls constrain via thermal star trails guiding pulls; dusk light reveals tiles and charges final glowing projection under the dome, filtering through Kira's drone priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode message tightens accumulatively through deepening discoveries narrowing from one chip to twelve; agency in drone use and pulls shows visible time pressure from fading light charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Missing pieces motif emerges organically to theme of cosmic belonging, but pilgrim's final explanation ("proving we belong not to one place but to the entire tapestry") is thematic echo, diluting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable Kira POV with perceptual signature in drone tech; voice modulates poetically yet legibly, dialogue natural though expository, distinguishing pilgrim's riddles from Kira's tech lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("tiles began to hum, each one contributing to a chord"); minor overwriting in repeated "brilliant dimness" and purple shadows slightly dulls peak sensory flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Type foundry matrices fusing printing tech with cosmic frequency synthesize archaeology and mysticism ingeniously; final resonance feels inevitable from thermal trails, transforming discovery trope boldly.</comment>
