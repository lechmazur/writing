<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in the embodied confession "I was protecting myself, not you," earning the vulnerable message-sending with relational cost on Marina; flaws complicate without hedging; interiority particular via shard pulses and scar-healing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (songs louder, visions forming) builds to Charged Poise closure when shard crumbles, releasing fear with legible cost; single scene oriented early in mangroves; pattern taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mangrove roots "twisted like frozen screams" and moonlight "pooled like mercury" constrain wading and visions while mirroring internal scars; spirits' singing evolves causally, charging final wade-out image; selective sensory hierarchy fits mystical POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evoke apology) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative deepening (windows reveal messages, time folds) narrowing to shard-press trade-off; agency forecloses silence with shard's destruction as visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability mending silence emerges via shifting images (unsent letters to dream-message); final "letters lifting, transforming into hope" resonantly reweights premise without moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (ethereal sensing: "roots twisted like frozen screams"); rhythmic modulation heightens intensity; purposeful compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("condensation rose like morning mist"); varied rhythm passes read-aloud; no loops or artifacts, figurative coherence (e.g., "pearl of truth") serves without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Notre-Dame shard in mangrove spirits transforms medium trope; risk-taking in condensation windows and time-fold yields inevitable hindsight reconfiguration; bold without gimmickry.</comment>
