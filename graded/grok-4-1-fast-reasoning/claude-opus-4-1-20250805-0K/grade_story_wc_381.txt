<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Solitary summoner's interiority shines in concrete micro-choices like compressing whispers into spheres, revealing patient endurance rooted in mentor's lesson; no strong contradictory impulses, but competence balanced by prophecy's resistance earns final renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from mapping silence to brook dispersal; on-page CR closure reweights prophecy premise with conceptual cost in "dispersed into a trillion smaller possibilities," legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Brook-mist and staff-traced boundaries constrain tactics and charge closure; sensory hierarchy (murmur foundation, moth-thoughts) selective via POV, evolving causally to morning light transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early tightens accumulatively via unfolding wing's resistance forcing redirection; agency in guiding flow forecloses destruction path with felt cost in prevented futures.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of redirection over destruction emerges organically from particulars like prophecy fragments into whale songs; final image's "ember-glow" and "whispers" offers resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-POV perceptual signature ("constellations in the mud," "invisible fruit") modulates rhythm with pressure; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short hum-catches amid longer ritual builds); purposeful metaphors like "wayward sheep" cohere without muddle, propelling to crisp final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami-moonlight prophecy and nature-allies hush transforms silencing trope; risk in tranquil ritual heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in brook-dispersal hindsight.</comment>
