<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between past movement ambition and present stillness endurance acts in pulse synchronization; final whisper earns renunciation of motion with centuries' dust as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as echo density spirals to own-voice return; Charged Poise closure at "I am still here" reconfigures time-navigation with endured stillness cost legible in layered dust.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bone towers as acoustic libraries constrain stillness-based reading of pulse via vultures/swallows; recurring canyon echoes charge final synchronization image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake of motionless mastery deepens when pulse synchronizes to heartbeat, narrowing to whisper response; agency in pressing arrowhead forecloses movement with visible dust/century cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stillness-as-journey theme emerges via arrowhead/bird callbacks; final "greatest journey...no steps at all" reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of foregone motion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in "reading...formations like sheet music" biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from observation to charged poise without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density in "each echo...contained a moment" propels without loops; varied rhythm and coherent metaphors peak cleanly at pulse source reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Time-navigation via acoustic stillness synthesizes fresh mastery frame; bold lyric risk in echo/bird accumulation heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
