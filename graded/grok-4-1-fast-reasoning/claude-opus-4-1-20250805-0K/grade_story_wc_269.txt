<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through tapping as thinking aid and embodied realization of transformation; final dive commitment earned by accumulating observations with felt cost of moored limbo; contradictory impulses (official data vs. shadows) act in scene without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation density builds to CR closure in descent and superimposed reflection, reweighting loss as metamorphosis with undeniable conceptual cost; orientation anchored early (station, reef, atlas); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Station glass, console tones, coral shadows constrain perception and choices (tapping reveals architecture); final descent charges image with water memory; sensory hierarchy (visual squint, tactile rhythms) POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Mooreton's truth) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via rhythm insistence and fragment assembly narrowing to dive agency; cost legible in foreclosed surface view and moored drift crystallized at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of metamorphosis over death emerges organically from coral-city image and tapping patterns, resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing; final superposition offers non-literal answer to paths transcribed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in rhythmic noticing and pattern-keeper idiom; rhythmic prose modulates intensity purposefully; no head-hopping, diction biased to scientist-granddaughter lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, realization without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies with scene (insistent tapping accelerates); minor figurative density in revelation beat purposeful and clear, no muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Town-to-coral premise fresh, synthesized through diary-atlas-coral logic with bold CR payoff; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes; no derivative echoes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
