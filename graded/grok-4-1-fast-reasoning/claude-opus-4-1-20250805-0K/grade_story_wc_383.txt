<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Charmed skeptic's contradictory impulses shine in the digging beat—"The skeptic in her questioned this madness, but the charmed part... drove her forward"—earning the final integration with embodied cost (scarred shell, dirt under nails).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whispers build density to shell reunion as RR/Charged Poise, cost legible in "not healing the break but honoring it"; one tightening (finding half) reconfigures stake without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Velvet garden and shell-as-micro-setting constrain choices (dig where whispers strongest) and charge final image (dawn gold, rainbow patterns); sensory evolution (petals open, perfume) mirrors internal shift purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover memories) deepens via agency-driven escalation (shell guides to digging); cost unmistakable in reverse archaeology and scarred harmony under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-architecture emerges organically, reweighted non-literally in final shells singing "not as trauma but as teaching... wings"; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in "choosing how to remember."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature (ghostly resolve in "archaeology in reverse") modulates rhythm under pressure; diction/rhythm heightens without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts, rhythm varies (short digging sentences propel); figurative language pattern-taught (resonance structures) integrates without muddle in peak reunion beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory quarantine and shell-resonance transforms grief tropes; bold lyric risk (calcium lattices archive) inevitable in hindsight, heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
