<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's expertise as arcane linguist drives key choices like speaking phantom titles to escape the trap and negotiating in the mountain's tongue, earning her transformative offer. Resourcefulness shown concretely via silver silk and gap research balances competence with struggle. Minimal interior contradiction limits peak emotional layering, but final renunciation of hoarding feels earned without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds cleanly: diary gaps lead to entry, trap solved via linguistic recall, culminating in on-page DC where Mira's offer cracks amber and fills blank pages with silver text as visible cost of her commitment. Single descending scene with one tightening at the heart fits defaults; orientation anchored by ~50 words at stone door. No lens ambiguity or unkept setups; closure reconfiguration reweights library from trap to garden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Granite shelves humming frequencies and rearranging passages constrain path-marking and trap-solving, charging climax. Diary's glowing specimens and amber's garden scent filter through Mira's priorities, mirroring internal shift from seeker to planter. Sensory mix (audible meaning, warm diary) purposeful without checklist; final swelling symphony integrates setting into closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to access unlearned lessons tightens via trap reversal narrowing exits, forcing linguistic agency, then peaks in negotiation foreclosing hoarding path with offer's cost. Causal lens escalation driven by protagonist choices; time traveler's frozen state complicates without resolving. One meaningful deepening suffices, with amber-seekers as felt price on prior failed missions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hoarded wisdom as seeds emerges organically from failed seekers, diary gaps, and Mira's offer transforming museum to garden without statement. Final image of swelling symphony and opening passages offers non-literal resonant answer to hoarding vs. planting, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of prior stasis. No moralizing; ambiguity in mountain's aliveness lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias toward linguistic patterns (e.g., gaps, dead languages); voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating from careful descent to resonant thrum at "Accepted." Minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven (Mira's offer, mountain's felt voice). Rhythmic variety supports pressure without head-hopping or elision withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action, sensory detail, and advance (e.g., "speaking their titles aloud in dead languages until the room shuddered"); varied syntax and openings propel descent. Minor figurative density (heart chambers, pressed flowers) purposeful without muddle or loops in peak beats. Clean mechanics, no scaffolds; final line recharges motifs concisely.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic botany mapping a living bookstore of unlearned lessons transforms tropes into organic drive, with renegotiation turning traps into invitation. Risky mountain sentience pays off in felt voice and starlight book without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from diary gaps to seed-planting; no derivative echoes.</comment>
