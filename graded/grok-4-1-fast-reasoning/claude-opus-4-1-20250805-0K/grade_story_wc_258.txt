<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vera's particular profession and micro-choices under Marcus's scrutiny reveal consistent traits and a hierarchy of values, earning her final stance; Marcus applies relevant pressure as sounding board. Interiority concrete but lightly embodied, lacking strong contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in Marcus's dawning ("They're architects") and Vera's "Forty-three days" correction, reweighting survival premise with rhythmic cost; orientation anchored early in loft setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rain-skylight-loft with salvaged servers evolves causally, mirroring digital persistence and charging final image of "rain-beaded glass" as lens on future; selective sensory hierarchy (auditory drumming, UV glow) filters through Vera's priorities, constraining revelations via table/tools.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving Jakarta archive) signaled early, deepens via card reveals narrowing to synchronization proof; one tightening at coordinates card forces Marcus's reconfiguration with conceptual cost of fragmentation's necessity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of connection patterns as true value emerges implicitly from card spirals and 43-day rhythm, resonating in final image of ghost data "mapping tomorrow's migrations" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Vera's perceptual signature (algorithmic intervals, ghost data); dialogue distinct (Marcus academic-direct, Vera corrective-precise), subtext-laden, advancing proofs; rhythmic modulation peaks in revelations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax/rhythm propels via integrated images (onyx cards under UV); minor figurative density (rain prisms, tape snake) purposeful and pattern-taught, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Onyx-ink cartomancy synthesizing digital archaeology transforms cyberpunk tropes into fresh cultural persistence frame; risk of poetic conceit pays off in inevitable 43-day cadence hindsight.</comment>
