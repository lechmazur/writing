<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Guarded druid's warlike serenity embodies motivation consistently, with micro-choices like diving and circling under pressure revealing hierarchy of values; interiority concrete in "practiced calm" amid vortex. Internal conflict subtle in accepting ancestor's burden, earned by revelations. Minor slip: epiphany at confession's thaw feels slightly abstract, not fully contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layered revelations in glass garden narrowing knowledge to CR closure; shattering ice with amber releases full truth, reweighting betrayal as sacrifice with reputational cost legible in final walk. Orientation anchored early at lake edge. One tightening at vortex heart suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass trees reflecting absences constrain navigation and charge final image of straightened orchard; selective sensory (blooms rotting, backward roots) mirrors internal deception layers via POV bias. Spatial choreography coherent through dive-emerge. Recurring amber sphere evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove innocence vs execution) signaled early, deepens accumulatively to Blight threat via garden discoveries forcing stance crystallization; agency in pressing sphere forecloses deception path with ancestor's sacrifice cost felt. One reversal at true seed tightens options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of deception-for-salvation emerges organically from confession layers, resonant CR in "truth, like water, always found its way" reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in spaces between honor/necessity charges seed's pulse. Complexity in willing pariah status lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in finding absences; distinct mythic texture modulates rhythmically ("roots grew backward into sky that existed beneath water"). No head-hopping or withholding; diction biased to lost truths.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("He dove... pulled him down"); no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks. Minor overwriting in simultaneous bloom/rot strains slightly but pattern-taught. Closure image crisp, rhythmic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garden of absences transforms druid tropes into fresh frame of reflections-as-truth-gaps; seed eating corruption synthesizes betrayal/Blight non-obviously. Risky surreal vortex pays off in straightened trees' reconfiguration.</comment>
