<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to seed chaos within constraints roots choices consistently, with interiority concrete in quill-trembling and map-making; embodied insight peaks in recognizing riverbeds over walls. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in-scene prevents 9+, but endurance of subtlety earns change with felt cost in sustained mapping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptive density builds from Mira's night work to Council's transformed meeting; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands in final quill-dip reweighting ignorance into inevitable futures, with conceptual cost of evolution over revolution legible in "making it inevitable."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian Spire and frozen lake constrain isolation and reflection, charging final footprints and quill-cleaning image; kingfisher quill as micro-setting tool recurs tactilely, mirroring hidden currents in negative space and bacterial languages.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of influencing Council via maps tightens accumulatively in embedded patterns shifting meeting dynamics; agency in "seeding controlled chaos" forecloses direct revolution with visible cost in observed pilot programs over restrictions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of evolution-through-ignorance emerges organically from maps revealing blind spots, resonating in final image of "more blank spaces to chart" that reweights systems dreaming without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature in mapping voids ("visual symphonies of probability"); rhythmic control heightens under completion pressure, diction biased toward possibility in "pathways branching from current ignorance."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via integrated images like "quill trembled as she began"; minor figurative density ("riverbeds directing flow") coherent and pattern-taught, no loops dulling closure quill-dip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ignorance cartography embedding visual algorithms transforms bureaucracy trope; risk in abstract-art subversion feels inevitable in Council's unconscious shifts, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
