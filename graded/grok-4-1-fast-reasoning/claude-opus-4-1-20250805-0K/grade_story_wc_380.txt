<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in the cemetery choice to return most vials despite temptation, earned by embodied grief recall in vials; micro-choices like pocketing one vial reveal values hierarchy with visible cost. Interiority particular via fluctuating vial weight mirroring emotional flux. Final renunciation integrates flaw of prior forgetting without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns accumulate to CR closure in "She kept only one... integrated slowly," reweighting premise with conceptual cost of partial grief reclamation legible in vial/pocket resonance. Orientation anchored early (whale three days ago, lantern lighter). Two-shard structure (chamber-cemetery-docks) tightens coherently without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Gravity pockets constrain digging ("earth came away easily") and charge final image (lanterns bend toward cemetery); salt crystal coffin mirrors grounds spirals, evolving causally. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (coffee swirls, flames bend). Micro-setting (vials in coffin) forces pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trace lost memories) signaled early via grounds; deepening revelation at coffin narrows options under Accumulative lens, forcing renunciation agency with cost in "grief had been unbearable." Pressure coheres to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: deleted memories accrue gravitational mass (whale drawn), resonant CR in lanterns bending toward "hidden graves of forgetting," reweighting without moral. Particulars (vials, flowers) shift meaning; ambiguity lingers in partial reclamation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (pattern-reading bias); rhythmic prose modulates (short sentences in digging beat). Perceptual filter consistent: gravity as memory conduit. No elision issues; voice biased toward omens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "vials... rendered visible" layers revelation/action); zero loops or scaffolds, rhythm varies (long crystal descriptions breathe into terse choices). Metaphors consistent (salt/gravity/memory), no muddle in peak cemetery beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity/memory extraction/whale magnetism transforms tropes organically; risk in surreal physics pays off at closure image. Premise implications followed fully (fluctuations reveal caches). Inevitable hindsight from early patterns.</comment>
