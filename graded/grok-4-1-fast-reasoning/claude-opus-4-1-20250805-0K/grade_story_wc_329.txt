<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to reawaken beauty roots in shell discovery and rhythm mapping, compelling higher-stakes playing; contradictory knowing/understanding cost acts in "suspended moment" and earns self-emptying closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as melody density breaks mechanical patterns, yielding RR/Charged Poise in "orchard bloomed in chaos"; cost legible in Lira "played yourself empty."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bridge rivets cue shell and elevate position for play; orchard's welded trees constrain until uprooting charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to awaken beauty escalates via intensifying melody narrowing mechanical resistance; agency in calibrated notes drives statue/orchard transformation despite alarms, with self-sacrifice cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shell motif shifts from preserved memory to liberation model, reweighting efficiency premise in trees singing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Musical perceptual signature ("heartbeats into melody," "ghost-rhythms") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from soft to chaotic without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory/musical imagery propulsion; no loops, varied openings sustain momentum to "world's tarnished wonder caught fire."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh violin-heart rhythm synthesis transforms steampunk tropes; risk in lyric accumulation pays off inevitably at statue dance/climax.</comment>
