<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vex's embodied ache ("weight of watching civilizations rise and fall") and micro-choice to thread magnetic bridges earn her final step through; contradictory immortality's "prison" vs. aiding rebels shows internal conflict acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of storm, amulet hum, and crew emergence builds to Charged Poise closure ("They stepped through... leaving the prismatic escondite empty"); cost legible in abandoned sanctuary image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite and solar storm constrain choices—Vex presses amulet to wall for window, threads fields for bridges—charging final empty image; sensory hierarchy (electromagnetic fury, bent light) reflects dimensional awareness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end immortality's prison) signaled early, escalates via Vex aiding emergence and fusing amulet under Accumulative lens; agency in "threading magnetic field lines" forecloses stagnation with escondite's abandonment as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation over stagnation emerges from amulet fusion and door beyond "forever," reweighting premise in final image without statement; ironic Consortium fear underscores earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable Vex-limited POV with perceptual signature ("dimensional awareness, feeling for weak points"); sparse dialogue goal-driven ("Let us through"), subtext-laden; rhythmic modulation peaks at "Together."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel via images like "light bent into impossible colors"; minor overwriting in storm descriptions purposeful for textural lens, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of immortality curse, dimensional rifts via amulet-storm fusion transforms tropes; risk in quiet door over explosion heightens conceptual stakes inevitably.</comment>
