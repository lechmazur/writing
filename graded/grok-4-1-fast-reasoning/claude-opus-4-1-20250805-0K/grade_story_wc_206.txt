<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation rooted in patient craft compels higher-stakes tethering despite wilting tremors; embodied reactions like shaking hands and smiling understanding show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Vex applies immediate pressure via lie-detected whisper. Minor slip in epiphanic summary ("understanding flooding... like morning rain") borders unearned, but prior causality earns closure endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: chip tethering causes resonance buildup, lie detection narrows to betrayal insight, triggering full-chamber linkage to decisive sunlight release. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (workshop, chamber, Elias). Closure DC lands on-page with legible cost in Vex's decay and curse dissolution ("Covenant of Rust dissolved like sugar in rain"). No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Resonance chamber constrains via harmonics singing silver threads and sympathetic vibrations amplifying chip; ten thousand mirrors charge final image by reflecting stolen light. Sensory hierarchy (hums, pulses, rust spots) reflects Elias's professional bias. Details evolve causally (tools spotting, boxes resonating) without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend via truth to reclaim dawn) signaled early, tightens causally via lie-whisper reversal forcing all-box linkage and Vex confrontation. Agency in persistent tethering despite tremors forecloses theft path with on-page cost (Vex's self-decay). Escalation driven by Elias's choices narrows options under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-mending vs lie-as-rust emerges organically through wilting, rust spread, and song-release; final image reweights via "seed of honesty that bloomed into day." No overt moralizing, though closing reflection ("some things are fixed... by understanding why they came apart") edges echo but integrates with prior images. Resonant without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (melodies as truth-fragments, rust as wilting); diction/rhythm modulates from delicate tension to triumphant ("music boxes played faster... symphony of crystalline truth"). Dialogue subtextual: Elias's measured reply evades, Vex's command falsifies. Clean free indirect without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "brown spots appeared on his workbench's metal tools" advances rust rule and pressure); rhythmic variety accelerates to climax without loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent and purposeful ("music box opened like a flower"). Zero artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music-box mechanics as truth-weaving against rust-curse alchemy transforms tropes; mirrors/decades prep feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening closure via light-amplification. Bold premise commitment (lies rust iron) risks ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
