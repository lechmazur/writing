<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under reflective pressure, like trembling fingers on the ledger revealing recognition over cold; final folding and walking earn renunciation of poisoned legacy with felt cost of assumed death. Minor reflective summaries slightly abstract contradiction, but impulses act simultaneously in decision to adapt via frost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations densify from ledger entries to frost patterns, yielding Conceptual Repricing closure in "She folded the ledger strip carefully, tucking it against her heart" with legible cost of old life's end. Single scene oriented early; no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frost patterns as micro-setting constrain realization and charge final image—"The morning light caught the ice crystals, making them glow"—mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism. Sensory selection (crystalline networks, drifting resonance) reflects artist's bias purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of ledger's legacy tightens via frost-deepening that reweights poison to adaptive beauty, forcing stance crystallization; cost felt in "Let them [mourn her death]." Agency in adaptive walking forecloses recreation path under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transformation from poison to safe luminescence emerges organically from uranium glass vs. frost particulars, with final image offering non-literal answer via "harmless luminescence." No moralizing; ambiguity in supplier choice lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature—artist's eye for "microscopic structures in glass" echoed in frost—modulates rhythmically with dawn shift; purposeful compression in revelations stays legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via integrated images like "frost-covered stone"; minor pattern repetition in "glow" and "patterns" purposeful for textural lens but borders overwrite in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radioactive glass legacy and frost as safe counterpoint transforms artist-arson trope; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight via canyon isolation.</comment>
