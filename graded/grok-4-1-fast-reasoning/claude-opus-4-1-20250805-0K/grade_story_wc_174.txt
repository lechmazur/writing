<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's serenity compels the core choice to transform the argument into a backwards puppet show, earning endurance with the felt cost of isolation; interiority particular via diplomatic/revolutionary contrast. Minor abstractness in "reversing the traditional narrative flow" dilutes embodiment slightly, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from post-argument hush to preparation, culminating in Conceptual Repricing where "every ending could be a different beginning" reweights premise with responsibility's cost (story stick's weight). Orientation anchored early (dome, argument 20 min prior); single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dome's acoustics and broken panels constrain workshop choices, mirroring narrative echoes; story stick and ink-grinding as micro-settings charge final image. Sensory hierarchy (shadows, firelight, whispers) filters through Marcus's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical storytelling post-argument) signaled early, tightens via decision to reverse narrative in next show under Accumulative lens, foreclosing explosive response with serenity's cost. Legible price in isolation shapes final poise; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of necessary truths without violence emerges organically from particulars (backwards puppets, dome echoes); final image ("touching brush to paper" amid meteor hush) offers non-literal answer, reweighting grievances as rehearsed stories without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (meteor/story metaphors bias noticing); lyrical diction modulates from reflective hush to charged preparation, rhythmic control heightens poise. No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early via dome echoes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action/reflection (e.g., "fingers traced... while considering"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Dense figuratives (shadows, meteors) coherent and pattern-taught, propelling to final image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Backwards-time puppets in dive bars from radar dome synthesize fresh ethical exploration; risk of nonlinear show heightens stakes organically. Transformation of argument trope via "consequences rewrite causes" feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
