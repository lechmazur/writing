<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as collector drives specific pursuit and teaching via off-key hum, earning Thomas's change; embodied emotions in tooth's pulse and her imperfect smile show contradiction without therapy-speak. Minor slip: Thomas's initial muteness resolves too neatly without deeper internal conflict shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: confession builds to resonant reconfiguration (RR/Charged Poise) as Thomas embraces flawed music and dissolves, with legible cost in tether's release ("becoming part of the morning's glow"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene causality tightens via Mara's hum urging the climax beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gorge constrains descent ("narrow path") and amplifies stakes (voice sevenfold, music weeping), charging final image as "cathedral of gold" mirrors integration. Sensory hierarchy (harp distortion, warming air) filters through Mara's priorities; sunrise evolution causal and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect via confession/healing) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening sorrow reveal and Mara's agency (hum, urge "play it broken") narrowing to stance crystallization; cost felt in Thomas's prior tether and Mara's "imperfect smile." No coincidence resolution; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection-as-beauty emerges organically from particulars (minor-key accident, off-key hum, broken harp); final image reconfigures "sorrow and joy" marriage without moralizing, offering resonant non-literal answer via luminous melody.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV to Mara with perceptual bias (tooth warmth, music recognition); voice lyrical yet controlled, modulating rhythm in peak (short sentences at climax). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Play it wrong"), advances confession; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "harp's broken melody folded into itself until it sounded like weeping made of music"); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor: occasional elevated diction ("spectral confessions") borders register drift but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folkloric collector, saint-swallowing tooth, and musical healing transforms tropes; crocodile's tooth and gorge music feel inevitable to closure's ache-to-luminous arc, with risk in quiet lyric ending.</comment>
