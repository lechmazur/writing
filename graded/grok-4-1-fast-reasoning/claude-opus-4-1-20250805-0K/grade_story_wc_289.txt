<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's interiority shines in concrete patterns from letters ("morning light through water"), earning reconciliation; Chen applies pressure via kept letters line. Minor reflection summaries slightly abstract emotional embodiment pre-closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: phrase patterns build density to CR closure in installation's infinite reflections, reweighting isolation with connection cost ("you are not alone"); orientation anchored in opening lotus pond image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pond reflections evolve causally, mirroring/doubling themes and charging final starry image; temple petals constrain work via prismatic shadows. Sensory hierarchy (glistening marble, solder/jasmine) filters via Mira's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rejoin threads) signaled early, tightens via Chen's "I kept your letters" revelation narrowing relational options; cost felt in past separation foreclosed by hand-hold under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Universal love-letter theme emerges organically from repeated phrases/installation without statement; final "ghostwritten or otherwise" reconfigures particulars resonantly, inviting ambiguity on whimsy/joy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (spirals, light refraction); dialogue subtextual ("You said you needed my hands") advances stakes. Lyrical rhythm modulates calmly to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; minor overwriting in metaphors ("wisdom wearing dancing shoes") slightly muddles one mid-build beat but spares closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostwriting patterns into spiral art retransforms longing tropes; installation's infinite pond reflections feel inevitable, risking whimsy for universal payoff.</comment>
