<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in prophecy and giving feels consistent and intensifies through embodied texture-feeling; interiority concrete via "gritty smoothness of change." Minor slip: epiphany on coincidences reads slightly unearned without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup (bugs syncing to alignment) yielding CR closure in "She was becoming the texture... wealthy in her poverty," cost legible as possessions' weight foreclosed. Orientation anchored early ("black sand... volcanic shore"); one tightening via bugs' whisper suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via heat humming bottles and ash scattering essence, charging final image; body as micro-setting in "fingers passed through the swarm." Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (glow competing with lava).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture understanding) signaled early, tightens texturally via bugs' pattern break ("matter transforms into energy") narrowing to transformation; cost felt in scattering essence under alignment pull.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice-as-metamorphosis emerges organically, final image ("bugs... orchestrating small coincidences") resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature biased to lights/textures ("living constellation"); rhythm modulates with intensity, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm variation; "texture" recurrence pattern-taught without loops. Minor overwrite in "vibrant hush" repetitions slightly dulls peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of philanthropy, bugs, cosmic/volcanic forces into textural CR; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, feels inevitable in "giving everything away was... to become everything."</comment>
