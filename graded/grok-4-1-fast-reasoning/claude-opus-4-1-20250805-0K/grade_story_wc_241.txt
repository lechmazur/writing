<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's internal conflict between theoretical rebellion and lived contradiction acts in scene via decoding under storm pressure; woman's line "Your father's addiction and your profession aren't opposites" earns her pivot with felt cost of reconciling them.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from notebook scrawls to dual lanterns' interference pattern; CR closure lands in Elena writing her message, reweighting her premise with conceptual cost of impossible hope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mica lanterns constrain realization by casting "probability curves and gambling odds," charging final image; rainwashed library anchors urgency, storm rattling windows mirrors chaos theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of traversing contradiction tightens via stranger's arrival and shared notebook, deepening knowledge with cost of accepting father's "dice and her equations" as same; agency in writing forecloses certainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of lucid contradictions emerges organically from scrawls to lanterns' dual truths; final image of "lanterns burned steadily... probability curves and gambling odds" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting math and addiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third-person perceptual signature filters math through melancholy bias ("odds were just pretty lies"); dialogue subtextual as woman maps "spaces where mathematics breaks down" without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with lines like "mica pane split the candlelight into rainbows" doing image+theme work; minor overwrought simile ("clover in late summer") in reflective beat but rhythm propels to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of subway math society transforms probability/gambling trope via lucid contradictions; risk of conceptual premise pays off in lanterns' interference as inevitable hinge.</comment>
