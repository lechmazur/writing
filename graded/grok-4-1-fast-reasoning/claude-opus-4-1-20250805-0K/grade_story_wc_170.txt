<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's contradictory impulses—perceptively calm yet urgent, painting calculated strokes amid thrumming heartbeat—act simultaneously, earning the closure's endurance of hope with trembling fingers as visible cost. Interiority particular via painterly lens on possibilities; motivation roots in Sophia's coma, compelling micro-choices like faster strokes and encoded spirals.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to layered painting, culminating in Charged Poise RR via sparrow's song and strengthening heartbeat, with cost legible in "fingers trembling only slightly" amid contracting time. Single scene coherent; orientation anchored early in terrace dawn; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism parapet constrains via rainbow fragments teaching light-bending secret, charging final image of dream doors; sensory hierarchy (echoes, droplets, colors) filters through painter's priorities, evolving with painting's bloom. Vivid, selective integration mirrors internal possibilities without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wake Sophia via possibility-maps) signaled early, tightens accumulatively: heartbeat quickens as city stirs, forcing faster work; sparrow reprise as decisive deepening reweights with agency in completed painting/song. Cost unmistakable in urgency's tremble and foreclosed time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of art bending reality for return emerges organically via prism secret, coded songs, and sparrow callback, offering resonant non-literal answer in "invisible doors opening" that reweights possibilities with emotional cost. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in dream-vs-reality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with painterly perceptual signature (colors as harmony/possibility); rhythmic control modulates from hush to bloom, heightening pressure without elision. Lyrical diction purposeful, legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: images like "violet shadows held golden promises" purposeful in painting beat; minor figurative density risks purple in color layers but pattern-taught via possibilities motif, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure sparrow image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirage-painting dream-maps for comatose child via prisms/songs transforms loss tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, with sparrow turn inevitable from prior song-encoding.</comment>
