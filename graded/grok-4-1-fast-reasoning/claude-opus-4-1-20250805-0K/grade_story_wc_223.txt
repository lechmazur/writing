<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marina's interiority shines in embodied survival trauma ("woke gasping from smoke") and micro-choices like tracing "U-N-B-I-N-D," revealing her drive to reclaim truth; endurance in refusing the summons earns stasis with isolation cost. Flaw of being mislabeled "crisis actor" complicates her historian role without safety-hedging. Contradictory impulses surface in irony of her "sanctuary" amid crisis echoes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: footsteps accumulate words/patterns toward CR closure in "W-E R-E-M-A-I-N," reweighting premise of absence with conceptual cost of unremembered pawns. Orientation anchors early (gallery, interregnum). Single scene tightens via visitor call without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Whispering gallery constrains choices—acoustics multiply footsteps into "chorus," charging walking method and final echo; chessboard pawns evolve from "lost generals" to luminous spaces mirroring internal absence. Sensory filter (echoes, marble footfalls) biases to Marina's perceptual priorities. Recurrent object (chessboard) shapes final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (document small gestures vs. grand narratives) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to renunciation of summons, foreclosing external legitimacy with felt isolation cost. Visitor crystallizes pressure, but no reversal beyond endurance—agency in refusal charges poise. Escalation coheres under textural lens via motif density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of small truths persisting in absence emerges organically from pawn voids and gesture catalog; final "spaces remembered them" reconfigures without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on history's omissions. Subtext layers in irony of her "actor" label vs. witness role. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-limited POV with perceptual signature in gesture-noticing bias; voice modulates lyrically ("ghosts of legislation") to rhythmic intensity in footfall chorus. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("Tell them the real witnesses are the gestures"), advances refusal. No head-hopping; elision of backstory anchors to present cues.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels: lines layer motif/atmosphere/action (e.g., "R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R M-E N-O-T" varies rhythm). Minor overwriting in metaphors ("nomadic penumbra," "wandering shadow") risks elevation clash, but consistent/voice-motivated without muddle or loops at closure. Syntactic variety breathes with scene calm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: walking-spells in acoustic gallery transform crisis-actor trope into historian's poise amid pawnless board—risky lyric structure heightens absence stakes inevitability. No derivative echoes; premise follows lived implications boldly.</comment>
