<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation rooted in heritage intensifies compellingly to the chamber choice; contradictory impulse shines in instinctively avoiding final details until pressure demands completion. Final drawing act earns change with embodied relief. Single-POV interiority particular and concrete throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to chamber revelation as CR, cracked pendant and reverse canals legible as conceptual cost in final lines. Orientation anchored early via studio and pendant hum. One tightening via gap-dive suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rooftop canals and giant's architecture constrain leaps and path to throat-gap, charging final reverse-flow image. Sensory details (thick residue, snores-ripples) POV-filtered via naturalist lens, integrated into action. No white-room; spatial choreography coherent across canal spiral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncage echoes) signaled early via fluttering illustrations; chamber discovery deepens via lens, narrowing to drawing agency with shake-cost. Escalation accumulates coherently, protagonist-driven. Trade-off legible in sculptors' panic vs. her relief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of honoring endings emerges organically via completed extinctions reweighting preservation premise; final clear canals and new drawings offer non-literal resonant answer. No moralizing; complexity in borrowed-time consequences lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with naturalist perceptual signature (e.g., "margins of time"); rhythmic modulation builds to chamber intensity. No head-hopping or withholding; diction purposeful and biased.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures in peak chamber beat. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene urgency; concrete images replace generics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinct echoes in time-theft premise transforms tropes via illustrator keys and giant-nap frame; risk in conceptual CR heightens stakes inevitably. No derivatives; particulars anchor originality.</comment>
