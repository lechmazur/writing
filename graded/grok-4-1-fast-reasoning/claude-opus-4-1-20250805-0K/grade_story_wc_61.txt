<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Solid interiority through embodied actions like pressing the gear to the photosphere and extending around the protostar, revealing contradictory impulses of mourning and celebration. Final endurance as sole witness earned with felt cost of isolation. Minor slip in occasional stock cosmic phrasing slightly abstracts peak emotional embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns build density to CR closure in final paragraph's smile and peace-making, reweighting eternity's burden with conceptual cost of endless witness legible in "burden and privilege." Orientation anchored immediately; no causality breaks in quiet shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nebula garden and gear as micro-setting constrain choices (measuring heartbeats, mapping via pings) and charge final image of gear spinning in virgin light. Sensory hierarchy cosmic-specific (gravitational ripples, photon harvest); vivid, selective integration mirrors internal patterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of troubling serenity tightens texturally via cadence shift from dying giant to nursery, narrowing to eternal endurance; agency in tending forecloses escape with isolation cost felt on-page. One meaningful deepening suffices; pressure coheres without reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of patterns approximating infinity emerges organically from stellar cycles and gear's iterations, resonant CR in final image reweighting sharing light's paradox without moralizing. Particulars like falling petals shift meaning; invites lingering ambiguity on witness burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with ethereal perceptual signature (starlight as dew, pings as sonar); rhythmic cosmic diction modulates from pulsing crimson to free-spinning gear, heightening serenity under eons' pressure. No elision issues; voice distinctively lyrical.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition (click-click, turning) propelling textural rhythm; varied syntax breathes with cosmic scale. Zero loops; metaphors coherent (petals, blooms) enhance without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic gardener with mechanical gear artifact transforms stellar lifecycle tropes into poignant infinity meditation. Risky lyric sci-fi commits boldly; final gear reprise inevitable from particulars.</comment>
