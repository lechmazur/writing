<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Renn's micro-choices in swapping pieces reveal contradictory impulses (thievery as giving mysteries) acting simultaneously, earning her closure transformation where master failed. Keeper applies targeted pressure via observation. Final renunciation of certainties carries visible conceptual cost tied to prior traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ice/sky images builds to CR closure when Renn places sundial lid on king, cracking it to release mirror—repricing knowledge as wonder with conceptual cost of unmaking power legible in Keeper's laugh/fade. Orientation anchored early in ascent. One tightening via piece revelations suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sky's "impossible geometries" and spire's "humming ice" constrain ascent/choices and charge final image's "beautifully, intentionally wrong" shift. Sensory selection (tactile palm on ice, visual backward constellations) reflects thief's perceptual bias, integrated via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pass test via wonder) signaled in master's instruction; Renn's agency in swapping narrows options from power to mystery under Accumulative lens. Deepening reweights with felt cost: "destroying priceless knowledge" but releasing wonder, charging Keeper's approval.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as unknown emerges implicitly from amendments (questions over answers); final "wrong sky watched her go, approving" reweights premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (fingers "reading emanations"); voice modulates rhythmically with pressure, e.g., "cautious abandon." Dialogue carries subtext—Keeper's curiosity shifts to laugh.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy swaps amid lyrical sky); no loops/artifacts, purposeful figures like "frozen needle" enhance without muddling peak swap beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Swapping secrets for questions/poems transforms chess-trophy trope into fresh conceptual risk, inevitable in hindsight from early sundial cue; bold synthesis heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
