<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent traits root motivation, with choral background enabling intuitive sensing of frequencies, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; empathetic decisiveness feels told via summary ("had always served her well") rather than tested in a pressured micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as elevator voices build density to Charged Poise closure in dawn gathering; orientation anchored early in tower/prairie; cost legible in "decades of isolation" drawn out, reconfiguring silos into bridges without micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tower's acoustics and dome constrain/charge her pendulum rig and amplify climax; elevators' corrugated walls as "vocal cords" evolve tactilely, mirroring internal states through resonant action; selective sensory hierarchy (sound-dominant) fits choral POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rehabilitate via choir) tightens accumulatively as elevators join sequentially, narrowing isolation with protagonist agency in humming/weaving; felt cost in "private grief" yields to cooperation, charging final image without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of linguistic harmony bridging silos emerges organically from polyglot chorus and neighbor responses; final swinging weight and card offer non-literal resonance reweighting premise, though "vigorous, tender" refrain borders overt without full ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases toward sonic details (gears clicking, bass notes); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, poetic diction voice-motivated for magical realism; no dialogue, but sparse whispers carry subtext efficiently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (weight rigging, planet alignment); varied rhythm propels to climax without loops, though minor paraphrase in "talking—really talking" and "vigorous, tender" refrain slightly dulls peak; no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise transforms mundane elevators into linguistic vocal cords via clock-tower conduction, synthesizing magical realism with agricultural decay into inevitable polyglot harmony; risk in anthropomorphic structures heightens stakes organically without gimmickry.</comment>
