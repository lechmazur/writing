<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (doubt from academy ridicule vs. persistent ritual) act in scene via setup despite weak magic; final vindication earned by her precise calibration with exhaustion cost at collapse against railing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via harmonic buildup (drops resonating through viaduct); on-page DC closure as fish solidify with legible cost in Mira's collapse; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct as tuning fork constrains ritual choice (channeling into structure); dew condensation and dawn equilibrium evolve causally, charging final stabilized ocean image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore ocean) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via suspended third drop blurring realms; agency in gentle magic touch forecloses collision risk with exhaustion price legible on collapse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of precision over power emerges organically until final paragraph's explicit moralizing ("Sometimes the cosmos needed not power but precision... devoted enough to prove it") replaces resonant image with thesis echo, triggering -0.6 penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (acoustic/frequency bias in noticing bell cracks, dew rates); rhythmic control heightens ritual tension without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short drop sentences accelerate climax); no loops or artifacts; figurative language ("quivering like mercury") purposeful without muddle in peak resonance beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weak mage + acoustic cosmology (dripping harmonics mending realms) feels inevitable; risk in nerdy precision premise heightens stakes via irreplaceable viaduct/bell logic.</comment>
