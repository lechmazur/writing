<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density building to CR closure in ice flowers and laughter ripples, with keystone tightening reweighting magic's value; orientation anchored early in spire and failure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mist and keystone constrain step and revelation, charging final path of luminance; sensory hierarchy POV-filtered (wind bite narrowing to glow) integrates purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of failure vs. simple magic tightens via mist success foreclosing Academy path, with agency in stepping and tracing keystone; cost felt in accepting underachievement legible at laughter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Imperfection as sacred emerges organically from mist gardens contrasting machines, resonant in final keystone weight lightening; minor directness in "last sacred act" slightly undercuts subtext.</comment>
