<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied grief-to-purpose arc via scents and tears culminates in earned transformation ("She was the perfume now"); contradictory impulses shine in cautious uncorking amid unraveling; no pivotal unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as scent density builds to CR closure ("tears weren't endings but translations"); cost legible in grief-catalyzed change; orientation anchored early in greenhouse and profession.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse's empty beds and UV-revealed "spectral root systems" constrain revelation and charge final blooming ghosts; sensory filter (scents overriding visuals) biases POV perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grieving mother's legacy tightens via scent waves narrowing to transformation; agency in uncorking forecloses prior self with emotional cost; one decisive deepening suffices under Accum lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of loss-as-luminous preservation emerges via particular scents/memories, resonant in final "grow in the dark" without moralizing; reweights premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (opalescent sheens, crystal shadows) modulates with intensity; stable close-POV elides backstory efficiently, paying off in charged memories.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion via varied sensory sentences builds density without loops; "crystal shadows lengthened" recharges motif crisply; minor metaphor density in peak scents but purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of olfactory ghosts and stellar lanterns transforms grief into archive; risk in fantastical transformation feels inevitable from vial's cue.</comment>
