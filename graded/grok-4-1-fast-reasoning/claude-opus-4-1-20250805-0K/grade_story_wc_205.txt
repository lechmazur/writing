<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cassia's revolutionary past anchors her motivation to see Venusians' defeat, with embodied fire reigniting in interruption of Huang; micro-choices like angling shard reveal values. Huang applies targeted pressure via protocols. Final proposal earns change via prior causality, with cost in past defeat repurposed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shard etchings to ghost revelation, tightening to Huang's curiosity shift and Cassia's realization. Orientation anchored early in Helicon-7 post-Revelation. Closure as Charged Poise/CR in final verse and smile, with conceptual cost of reimagined purpose legible in "some defeats were simply preparations."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid and temporal streams vividly constrain via mirrors' draped secrets and storm's approach mirroring internal states; shard as micro-setting charges ghost beat and final pulse. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (tactical maps to currents). Details integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Venusian claim) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via shard demo forcing Huang's curiosity; Cassia's agency in proposal forecloses protocol path. Cost felt in emotional thickness and past defeat. One decisive deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of imaginative revolutions emerges from shard ghosts paralleling Cassia's defeat, resonant in final "unimaginable victories" without statement. Subtext in whispers/verse avoids moralizing; complexity in Huang's resistance lingers. Final image reweights premise organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature (timestreams as rivers, etchings as maps); dialogue subtextual (Huang's tone shift) and goal-driven. Rhythm modulates with intensity; diction character-bound to Cassia's cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in revelation beats; minor figurative density ("frozen tears," "liquid history") purposeful without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible time, crystalline souls, baroque space palace transforms archaeology trope via revolutionary lens; risk in ghost demo pays off at closure without gimmick.</comment>
