<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marcus's resilient positivity and moment-collecting motive drive choices consistently, with embodied interiority in the hourglass "humming against his ribs." Final endurance of perpetual journey earned via prior accumulation, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak merger beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of timeline fragments builds to on-page RR closure as hourglass shatters and timelines braid, reconfiguring ferry's existence with felt cost of embraced permanence. Orientation anchored early in ferry crossing; no lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Spectral grotto and phasing cliffs constrain boarding and intensify for climax under starlight; hourglass as micro-setting charges final shattering. Sensory details (groan, mist, flicker) selective via Marcus's potential-seeing bias, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unifying timelines signaled via collected moments; accumulative deepening peaks in "Convergence protocol initiated," narrowing to eternal journey with legible cost in "no longer ardent for escape." Agency in radioing selves; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of potential in transience emerges organically from passenger's merging reflections and Marcus's unified selves, answered non-literally by compass "point[ing] to now—every now." Resonance from particulars avoids moralizing; final image reweights premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of seeing "potential futures in briefcases"; rhythmic prose modulates to intensity at "timelines began to braid." Minimal dialogue natural and subtextual ("Which timeline tonight?"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: vivid images like "clocks run sideways" advance texture without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful in accumulative build; minor density in descriptive runs contained, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of interdimensional ferry and moment-collecting hourglass transforms multiverse trope into personal unification; risk of poetic accumulation pays off in charged closure without gimmickry.</comment>
