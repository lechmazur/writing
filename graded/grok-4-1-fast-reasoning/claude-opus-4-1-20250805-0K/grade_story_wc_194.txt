<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (hunger for power vs. generational poison) act vividly in the vision crescendo, earning the final renunciation; interiority embodied in the warm crank and rippling waves. Flawless micro-choices under pressure reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase via intensifying waves narrowing to choice; on-page DC (handle thrown) lands with legible cost in "not-knowing felt like freedom." Orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring crank handle constrains pivotal choice and charges final image (thrown through window, catching light); sepia room and golden shadows filter through POV bias, mirroring internal release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (end curse) signaled early, deepens via waves' crescendo forcing agency (lift needle, throw); cost unmistakable in lost perception ("couldn't sense... resentment or... sorrow"). Lens-driven tightening reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image (mockingbird song she "couldn't tell what it meant") offers resonant non-literal answer to knowledge-as-curse, reweighting premise without moralizing; emerges organically from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (truth-perceiving silence); rhythmic lyricism modulates with intensity, peaking in clean free-indirect visions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, varied rhythm; minor figurative density in waves beat purposeful under accumulative lens, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms curse trope via thought-recording gramophone into fresh CR (vinyl as stolen secrets); bold lyric risk heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
