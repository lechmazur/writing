<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses (clinical report vs. saving film) acting simultaneously in the swaying and kissing moments; final renunciation earned by revelations. Micro-choices reveal values under pressure, like threading film through fingers amid overwhelming tide.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from booth geography to layered letters to Eleanor, culminating in CR closure (tucking film) with legible cost (professional defiance). Orientation anchored early; no shards, pattern taught immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Projection booth as vessel constrains reading (northwest regret, ceiling hope) and charges final image (kissing film strip); sensory details (cool brass, silver and salt taste) selective via POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve unused love vs. demolition) signaled early, deepens via psychometric tide overwhelming Vera; agency in stealing film forecloses professional path with felt cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of stored unused love emerges organically from film revelations and booth as incubator; final image (carrying seeds) offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting prior emotional geography.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (spatial imagination: "three-dimensional diary"); rhythmic diction modulates with intensity, prose as character in "hushed thunder of her own heartbeat."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density integrates image/action; minor figurative density in peak (layering like double exposures) purposeful for textural lens but borders overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh psychometric premise transforms theater tropes via emotional geography and film-embedded letters; risk in lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmickry.</comment>
