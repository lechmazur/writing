<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between memory's safety and creation act in the drawing scene, earning the final renunciation of precision with visible cost in her unrecallable work. Interiority concrete via charcoal as grief embodiment. Flawlessly individual voice through artistic lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of cave sensations and revelations builds to Charged Poise RR/CR closure in the wall-drawing epiphany, reweighting her artistic rule-set with undeniable cost (freedom from perfect recall). Single scene causality via lock/note/clues intact. Orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystal cave constrains choices (narrow passages, resonant strokes) and charges final image (drawing wakes harmonics). Charcoal fingers as micro-setting enable tactile creation. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: artistic refractions over generic dark.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (unlock creativity via grief) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening discoveries to agency in unpremeditated drawing, foreclosing memory-perfection path with legible cost in the unprecedented work. One decisive cadence shift suffices and lands impeccably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. emergence answers via final image of drawing beyond recall, reweighting prior lock/clues without moral. Emerges organically from particulars like cadmium yellow splash; ambiguity lingers in "imbalance rectified."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature: synesthetic cave (colors sound) biases noticing. Rhythmic modulation peaks in drawing flight; purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly. No head-hopping or leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring emotional ascent; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figs. Minor register elevation ("cathedral of stone") fits artistic POV without drift. Propulsion peaks in "fingers flew across the stone."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synthesizes grief/art awakening via cave's synesthesia and metaphorical lock into inevitable CR; transforms sibling-ghost trope through mnemonic constraint. Risky magical realism (humming crystals) heightens stakes organically.</comment>
