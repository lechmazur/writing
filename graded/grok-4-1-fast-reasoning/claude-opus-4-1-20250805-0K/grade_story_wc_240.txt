<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is concrete and embodied ("breath caught," "quiet wildfire"), with contradictory impulses (professional walls vs. personal connection) driving the earned call to Chen; flaws like ex-partner reflection anchor to present cues without flattening pressure. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("physics of letting go") borders therapy-speak but ties to micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building patterns of light-bending and synchronization to CR closure (boundaries as bridges, laser stills); orientation anchors early (Maya in farm pre-birdsong); cost legible in final image of permeable heart with foreclosed isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bioluminescent glow, spongy substrate, gossamer barriers vividly constrain choices (laser traces anomalies) and charge closure (light passes through); sensory hierarchy reflects spatial gift, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (detect intrusion) deepens texturally to personal boundaries via fungal patterns, narrowing isolation with agency in observation-to-call; one tightening (gap discovery) forces trade-off, cost felt in vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of permeable boundaries emerges organically from fungal quantum bridges to Maya's heart, resonant non-literal close reweights premise without moralizing; ambiguity in "familiar strangers" invites reflection via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (spatial mapping, light patterns) biases noticing; voice modulates rhythmically with intensity, stable third-person limited; brief dialogue natural, goal-driven ("boundaries don't have to be barriers").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; minor overwriting in metaphors ("quiet wildfire," "patient heat") slightly muddles peak realization but doesn't obscure closure; no loops, clean syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fungal quantum entanglement as personal metaphor transforms tropes (epiphany via nature); risk in biological implausibility paid off by internal logic, inevitable hindsight reconfiguration heightens stakes.</comment>
