<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Symphonically minded trait enables unique perception and tender choices distinguishing her from failed sculptors; micro-choices like swaying to tree rhythms embody contradictory gentleness amid Silence's pain, earning final endurance with insulator's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of released notes builds to Charged Poise closure; orientation anchors in first paragraph (hedgehog, grove, Silence); porcelain's feedback loop and etched fractures make cost legible in final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stress cracks and porcelain insulator constrain strumming choices and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (subtle vibrations over visuals) reflects Mira's symphonic bias; grove's scars evolve from scarred bark to swaying branches in music.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free tree songs) signaled early deepens accumulatively from single note to symphony, narrowing to tenderness vs. force; agency in feedback loop forces trade-off, with insulator's new cracks as visible cost charging ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of compassion restoring memory emerges via particulars like migration strata; final image of ghost birdsong offers resonant answer to Silence without moralizing, reweighting premise through etched tool.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with symphonic perceptual signature (harmonies in cracks); rhythmic prose modulates from subtle coaxing to swelling melody; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with lines like "frozen sound waves, crystallized vibrations" advancing texture; varied rhythm breathes with escalation, no loops; minor figurative density in descriptive peaks fits accumulative mode without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Tree memories as sound strata and porcelain's electrical hum repurposed ingeniously transform Silence trope; risk of lyric non-causality heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via feedback loop.</comment>
