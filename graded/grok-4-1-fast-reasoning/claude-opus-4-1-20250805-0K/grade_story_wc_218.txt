<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Mira's shift from expecting groundskeeping to embracing death as translation, earned via diary revelations; final writing/renunciation forecloses remodel path with her life as cost. Interiority particular (tumor as "electromagnetic signature"); no label-speak flattens peaks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wire coils to full network shudder, yielding CR closure in "die at the correct frequency" realization with conceptual cost (her appointment). Orientation anchored early (orchard, diagnosis); no ambiguity at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Living stone pillars and oak constrain wire placement per diary patterns, charging final palm-press glow; sensory selective (wire vibration, leaf rustle sans wind). Micro-setting (copper network) mirrors internal reconfiguration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (block remodel, enable interspecies council) signaled early, accumulates via network connections narrowing to her tumor's role; agency in wiring/testing forecloses human-centric path with life-cost legible in diary line.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies respect emerges via wire-mediated pulses, reweighted in final image (palm on pillar feels "ancient patience"); non-literal answer to remodel question via boundary shift, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV with perceptual signature (scientific frequencies in poetic terms); rhythmic control modulates from precise wiring to charged poise at end. No head-hopping; diction biased toward botanical/architectural specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density (e.g., "copper coil placed according to mathematical patterns" advances action/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; final-line image propels without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tumor-as-frequency-translator transforms terminal diagnosis trope; risk in interspecies council premise heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via diary payoff.</comment>
