<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's obsession inherited from Marcus drives micro-choices like refusing rescue and entering the storm, with embodied warmth in the telescope revealing character under pressure. Internal shift from doubt to conviction feels earned without epiphanies. Minor reflective summaries slightly abstract motivation before closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through observations to CR closure: final notation reweights "empty spaces remember" as "they give memories back," with conceptual cost in correcting Marcus legible in last lines. Orientation anchored early in gondola at 30k feet. Single tightening via storm entry holds without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Telescope as micro-setting constrains observation and charges final image held "against the brightening sky." Sensory details like swaying gondola and dusty starlight filter through meteorological bias, evolving with dawn. No generic placeholders; weather pressures untethered drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to prove theory signaled early via logbook; deepening via spooled storm revelation narrows to realization under accumulative lens. Agency in refusing helicopters and tracking shows trade-off of isolation. Cost felt in perpetual drift completing cycle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of atmospheric memory emerges organically from cloud categorizations to final CR image returning memories earthward, reweighting premise without moralizing. Resonance in rain droplets cycling stories answers central question non-literally. No tidy binaries; indigenous knowledge adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in emotional cloud taxonomy and biased noticing of phantom geology. Prose texture poetic yet controlled, modulating from dusty starlight to morning clarity. No dialogue; diction fits aviator-poet lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene breathing; high density integrates action, image, perception without loops. Minor figurative density in "spooled wholeness" cloud description purposeful, not muddled. Final line recharges opening motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorology as earth's memory taxonomy transforms tropes into "clouds by emotion" with indigenous echoes. Risky lyric accumulation heightens conceptual stakes; final CR inevitable from particulars. No derivative templates.</comment>
