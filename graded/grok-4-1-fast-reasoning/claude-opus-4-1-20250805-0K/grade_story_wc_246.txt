<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between saving colonists and preserving discovery act in the transmission beat; final choice earned by guilt-driven searches and pen anchor, with visible cost of potential growth loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelation density builds to CR closure in dual transmission; cost legible in "those colonists would be saved, but humanity would never discover"; orientation anchored early in chamber/anomaly setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pen as micro-setting constrains choice by anchoring her timeline amid anomaly pressure; twisted starlight and floating evoke observer bias, charging final image where nib catches light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ship's anomalous trajectory tightens dominant stake of error vs. discovery under accumulative lens; agency in transmitting both forecloses clean resolution with trade-off cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final anomaly pulse and comfort reweight contingent editing premise non-literally, emerging from personalized visions and dual choice without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "constellations of data" and "cosmic editor" biases pattern-noticing; stable close-third modulates revelation density without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density weaves interiority/action seamlessly; varied rhythm propels without loops, as in crisp transmission beat free of figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cosmic editor synthesizing observation/history transforms sci-fi tropes organically; pen-grandfather contingency inflects freshly, heightening stakes in dual-transmission risk.</comment>
