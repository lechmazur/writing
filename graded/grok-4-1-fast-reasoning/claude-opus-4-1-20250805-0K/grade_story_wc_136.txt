<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory analytical/artistic impulses act in scene ("analytical mind resisted...artistic soul recognized") and propel the final transformation to "steady purpose," earned by escalating steps with embodied cost (trembling fingers to devoted sketching).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from first arrow to mist-parting ("tool blazed cold"), delivering CR closure in fortress realization with conceptual cost of perpetual navigation; constraint of arrows/punch shapes entire tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist, pavement cracks, and vault constrain choices (follow arrows, punch mist) and charge final image (shifting fortress of moments); sensory hierarchy (humming sole, five-directional shadows) reflects cartographer's bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (follow arrows) escalates via accumulative density to fortress deepening, driven by agency (precise boot placement, experimental punch) with felt cost in ongoing returns; minor abstractness in stakes prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of "careful, impossible maps" offers resonant non-literal answer to mapping truths, reweighting 3AM honesty premise from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with cartographer's perceptual signature ("eyes tracing cracks...perfect arrows"); rhythmic control modulates from lyrical mist to charged vault without head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("pavement hummed...mist thickened with purpose"); no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors (mist "parted like curtains") enhance without muddling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crack-arrows to fortress of unspoken truths feels inevitable, with risk-taking in surreal geometry heightening stakes; punch transforms trope into irreplaceable validator.</comment>
