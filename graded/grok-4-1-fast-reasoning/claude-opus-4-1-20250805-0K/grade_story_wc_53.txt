<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via scavenging vs. rebuilding tension, culminating in earned recognition as memory keeper when ghost hand meets hers; interiority particular through embodied time confusion and object handling. Final choice forecloses eroded ambitions path with felt cost of transformed self.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: voice fragments build density to timeline snap CR at "their fingers met," reconfiguring chronology with conceptual cost of simultaneous whens; orientation anchored early in carousel/lagoon, no disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lagoon mist and carousel mechanisms constrain choices (e.g., brass pole condensation yields voices) and charge final image of waters moving; sensory selection (thermal currents, vapor echoes) reflects Kira's scavenger urgency, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ambition reconciliation) signaled early, tightens via camera wheel press forcing ghost interaction and timeline reconfiguration under Accumulative lens; agency in winding wheel forecloses confusion with legible cost in dissolved ghost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformed ambitions emerges organically from fragments and ghost negotiation, final image of nodding ghost dissolving offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting self-sufficiency without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature of time-misted noticing (e.g., "head spin worse than the carousel"); rhythmic diction modulates from stillness to subtle motion, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., voice impressions integrated into action); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, purposeful figurative coherence in mist/echo vehicles charges closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of water-molecule memories and ghost negotiation transforms eroded ambitions trope; risk-taking in timeless drift heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via fragment accumulation to moving waters.</comment>
