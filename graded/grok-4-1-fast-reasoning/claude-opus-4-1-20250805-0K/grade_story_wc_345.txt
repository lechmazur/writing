<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Marina's altruism drives consistent actions from discovery to fading, earning her closure with felt cost in dissipation; families show credible shift via micro-choices like sharing samples. Limited on-page interior contradiction for Marina weakens depth—no simultaneous impulses dramatized beyond observation. Archetypal family clusters lack individual flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: messages accumulate density to revelation and unity, tightening via families' cautious reexamination; closure as RR (Charged Poise) lands on-page with Marina's fade and bell materialization, cost legible in her final descent. Mosaic shards (dawns, gatherings, six months) taught early via "each dawn," transitions legible. Orientation anchored by para 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating arches constrain vantage for watching/writing, charge final image as "frozen clouds"; crimson sky, blight rot, fungal soil integrate tactilely via drift, scrawls, samples. Sensory hierarchy matches ethereal POV then communal urgency; no white-room—orchards evolve with blight/healing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchard survival via unity) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through messages to sharing/revelation under lens; one tightening at Dr. Chen's announcement narrows suspicion, forces fence-tearing with felt labor cost. Agency via ghost orchestration and families' micro-yields coheres pressure to RR closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of strangers-to-family emerges organically from blight isolation to interwoven roots, reweighted in final message/image without sermonizing until Marina's earned fade. "Brambled hope" recurs charged; no tidy binary—lingering blight adds ambiguity. Counter-reading viable in ongoing messages.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person multi-POV via shard breaks (Marina → Tom → gathering → finale), coherent under communal lens; perceptual signature ethereal-to-grounded (drifting/chiming to soil warmth). Dialogue sparse/natural, subtext in "Don't know, but they were right"; rhythm modulates dawn urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax mirroring ethereal flow to communal bustle; zero loops, clean metaphors ("despair made visible") purposeful without muddle. Rhythmic ear test passes—openings vary, para lengths breathe with time jumps; closure image sharpened by "still warm somehow."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ethereal ghost-orchestrated fungal network saves sci-fi orchards, transforming isolation trope via chalk messages and inter-grove diversity. Risk in mosaic time-compression heightens stakes without gimmick; final bell reprise inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
