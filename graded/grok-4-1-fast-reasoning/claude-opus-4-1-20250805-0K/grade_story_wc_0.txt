<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with physicist-specific contradictions between aggressive analysis and patient wonder, embodied in daily visits shifting to resignation; final choice earned via accumulated observations with career cost legible in supervisor's accusation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through dust buildup to CR closure in notebook entry ("Decay is not drama. It is instruction."), reweighting catastrophe with conceptual cost of career path foreclosure; orientation anchored early, one tightening in dust patterns predicting failures.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting evolves tactilely (mud-caked benches, dripping rainwater, fractal mold) to constrain choices like building stations and charge final image; POV-filtered details (lensing geometries in dust) mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of analytical precision vs. observational humility tightens accumulatively via dust micro-environments narrowing her research path; agency in documentation/resignation forecloses prior career with felt cost in "career suicide" line.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of decay-as-instruction emerges organically from dust accumulations and colleague contrasts; resonant CR in final notebook reweights premise, but explicit articulation ("Decay is not drama") in closing lines borders thematic echo, docking score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature of physics metaphors (neutron collapse, gravitational lensing); rhythmic modulation builds lyric density without elision or head-hopping, prose texture distinct and controlled under observation pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "dust" recurrences teaching accumulative pattern, strong verbs/syntax propulsion, varied rhythm; minor paraphrase loops in dust descriptions ("patterns," "maps," "blueprint") prevent higher band without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of butterfly dust as gravitational analog transforms epiphany trope into inevitable CR; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes of quiet renewal without gimmickry, fully committed to premise.</comment>
