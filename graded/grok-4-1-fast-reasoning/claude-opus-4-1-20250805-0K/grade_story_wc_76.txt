<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in lifelong craft drives precise actions at climax; interiority concrete via embodied understanding ("fingers moved with the same precision"). Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal dismantling, but earned closure choice forecloses prior rebellion with felt personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: yoyo etchings → dismantle lens → wind wire → stone inverts with on-page DC/RR and bittersweet cost ("bleak exhilaration"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene tightens meaningfully at "light exploded outward."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (water "dripped backward up the walls," stone's "void that pulled at her vision") filter through Elara's clockmaker bias; lighthouse constrains choices via lens assembly and stairs. Final beam "swept backward across the dark water" charges closure image indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reverse stone's hunger) signaled early, escalates causally via pulsing radiance and writhing stone narrowing options during dismantling. Agency in "winding copper wire counter clockwise" forces trade-off with visible cost in stone's fight; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reversing fate emerges organically from particulars like backward clocks/yoyo to final "beacon for all things that refused to surrender"; resonant non-literal answer in light calling "home ships that had been lost to history" reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (time reversal motifs like "breath caught" amid backward drip); rhythmic control heightens pressure in climax ("sound like time itself cracking"). No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "each loop following the yoyo's encoded pattern" advances multiple jobs); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test. Minor overwriting in stone description ("darker than absence") but coherent, no loops/artifacts dulling closure "light exploded outward."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of backward timepieces, hunger stone, yoyo key transforms tropes organically; risky reverse mechanics culminate inevitably in "stone inverted." Bold poetic voice heightens stakes without gimmickry, feels singular.</comment>
