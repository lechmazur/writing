<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Father's shift from hunter to learner earned through embodied touch on plant and sheathing weapon, revealing contradictory impulses; Mira's pacifism shown via micro-choices like not hurrying. Minor label-speak in "senseless perception" slightly abstracts interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as Mira's routines build density to father's arrival and joint planting (Charged Poise closure); cost legible in his "hollow eyes" and deliberate sheathing. Single scene anchors orientation early (dome, farm); no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass dome and desert roses constrain choices (inside peace vs outside harshness) and charge final image of "impossible garden"; tactile details like "calloused fingers" filter through Mira's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of weaving continuity through chaos signaled early, tightens via father's interaction forcing stance crystallization; agency in Mira leading him to plant, with felt cost in his exhaustion and recognition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of growth as antidote to destruction emerges organically from planting and contrasts, resonant in final "something else rose" without moralizing; dialogue correction ("weave continuity") borders echo but ties to action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent third-close POV with perceptual signature (noticing "spaces between violence"); sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("This one knows your story"), advances reconciliation. Rhythmic control modulates from meditative to charged.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm in plant descriptions; minor paraphrase loops in "teaching" concepts ("inculcating values," "engraved quiet") dull peak slightly but pattern-taught. No artifacts at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-tower pacifism via "engraved quiet" and plant inculcation transforms tropes; risk in tranquil tone amid violence pays off in charged family image.</comment>
