<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to read scars drives concrete micro-choices like tracing the coffee ring, with embodied contradiction in seeking closure through opening wounds; internal conflict layers via plant telepathy overload. Minor diagnostic phrasing in epiphany ("scars were libraries") borders therapy-speak but anchors to scars' physicality. Final realization earned by prior surgery/causality, foreclosing tidy closure with cost of perpetual openness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from anesthesia fade to scar-reading via patterns, culminating in CR where openness reconfigures premise ("some wounds were meant to stay open"); cost legible in final turning of hourglass as accumulation, not loss. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (tower medical bay, post-surgery). Single scene, no shards; lens taught early via root-whispers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Body as micro-setting (scarred palms against glass) constrains perception and charges final image; coffee ring, hourglass, dawn light selectively mirror internal states through POV bias (pattern-reading). Sensory hierarchy narrows to tactiles under post-anesthesia haze. Garden vines guide choice to press palm, evolving with realization; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode miracle via scars) signaled early, deepens via plant chorus narrowing to ambient healings; agency in examining stains/feeling vines forces renunciation of closure-seeking. One tightening: scars "speak" post-surgery, reweighting options under textural lens. Cost felt in perpetual woundedness charging final image; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transformed miracles/scars-as-invitations emerges organically from particulars (dispersed healings, tunnel scars); final image (hourglass turned, wounds as doors) offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in imperfect circle echoes scars; ambiguity lingers in "smaller doors." No thematic echo or platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature (microscopic patterns in stains/rings as tree rings); POV stable, single focalizer with biased noticing (flora grief, chlorophyll dreams). Rhythm modulates from hazy fade to clarity, compression purposeful in accumulative mode. No dialogue; diction reflects pattern-obsessed mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density: lines multilayer (e.g., "concentric ripples of healing and hurt" advances image/theme/prose rhythm); no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks. Metaphors consistent (tunnels, rings, maps) without muddle in peak realization. Minor overwriting in scar-library simile, but pattern-taught early; propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: scar-libraries + plant telepathy + dispersed miracle transforms healing tropes into textural CR; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in charged poise of openness. No derivative echoes; particular details (chlorophyll dreams, vegetable grief) feel inevitable. Bold non-causal drive heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
