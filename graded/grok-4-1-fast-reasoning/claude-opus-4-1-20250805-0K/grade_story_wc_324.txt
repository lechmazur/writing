<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's persistent curiosity drives concrete micro-choices like following pulses and whispering assurances, embodied in tasting copper and gasping at the photo; internal conflict emerges subtly in her incidental heroism against unintended guardianship. Backstory anchors tightly to present hearing aid without flattening pressure. Minor slip: realization of voice theft feels slightly unearned without more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pulse rhythms, photo fading, and dirge build density to CR closure in basement pinpoint and hearts remembering, with felt cost of her heroism refusing forgetting; orientation anchors early in atrium/Willowbrook photo. One tightening via photo eyes-to-understanding narrows options decisively. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist, orchids leaning, copper taste, and glass amber constrain path and mirror thinning boundaries, charging final mist-lift image; sensory hierarchy via Mara's auditory bias (pulses over visuals) integrates with action. Photo as micro-object evolves tactilely (warm, clutched). Twilight evolution pressures pursuit perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to trace silence tightens accumulatively via SOS pulse and photo erasure forcing run to basement, with agency in following/understanding foreclosing inaction; cost legible in photo faces returning only as she commits. Escalation coherent under lens without coincidence resolution. One micro-turn sufficient; peak moral calculus between curiosity and heroism sharpens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerable voices against contagious forgetting emerges organically from pulse theft realization and final hearts-speaking image reweighting curiosity-to-heroism without moralizing. Subtext in fading faces and minor-key birthday invites ambiguity on memory's currency. Protagonist arc inextricable; resonant non-literal close avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with auditory-biased perceptual signature ("pulses were different: urgent, fractured"); rhythm modulates from descriptive to propulsive in run, diction sensory-specific without filter stacks. Whispered dialogue sparse but subtextual ("Who's taking them?"). No head-hopping; voice coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.9<grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short shrieks to dirge syncopation), density high with multi-job lines like "orchids that seemed to lean away"; no loops, scaffolds, or metaphor muddle in peaks—mist/breath simile purposeful. Minor overwriting in opening simile string, but doesn't touch closure propulsion. Clean grammar, strong verbs propel to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of audiologist tracing emotional contagions via grandma's hearing aid transforms ghost-story tropes into voice-harvest premise; incidental heroism turn inevitable from curiosity constraint. Risky sound-pattern elision (SOS heartbeats) heightens without gimmick; no derivative echoes.</comment>
