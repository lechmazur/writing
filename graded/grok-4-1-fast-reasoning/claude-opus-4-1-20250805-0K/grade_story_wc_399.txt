<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in seven-year purpose intensifies to compel consecration and mask removal; interiority concrete via peripheral awareness and scars. Mask removal earns change with embodied cost in final scene. Minor lack of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously slightly limits peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of realizations and consecrations reweights stake toward preservation; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration via mask removal revealing scars (felt cost on page: "revealing scars that mapped their own boundaries"). Orientation anchored early in first paragraph. One meaningful tightening at dimming maps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (murmuring, humming pillars) filter through POV's boundary-walker bias; kinetic parapet evolves, responding to consecrations and charging final image as guardian against forgetting. Pavilion and clearings constrain choices via thresholds and maps. Micro-setting (half-mask) enables dual-world connection pivotal to climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wisdom echoes) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via dimming clearings and purposeful parapet response; agency in consecrations forecloses erosion path. Escalation coheres under lens with felt exhaustion cost at dawn return. No reversal but single deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of preservation via boundaries emerges organically from clearings as vessels; final pavilion murmur and parapet dance offer resonant non-literal answer reweighting purpose. Minor thematic echo in prophet's line ("You understand") borders statement but ties to action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (peripheral awareness, boundary cadence); voice texture distinct in rhythmic, hushed diction modulating to urgency in consecrations. Dialogue sparse, natural, goal-driven ("You felt it too"). No head-hopping; elisions purposeful for mystery payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density integrates setting/action; minor paraphrase loops on "wisdom echoes" (e.g., repeated phrasing in realizations) dulls slightly but doesn't touch closure. No filter stacks or template cadence; metaphors consistent without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of boundary-walking fantasy with memory-sand mechanics; mask removal reconfigures personal/world stakes inevitably from prior particulars. Bold world logic (living parapet, conjured spaces) heightens without gimmick; no derivative echoes.</comment>
