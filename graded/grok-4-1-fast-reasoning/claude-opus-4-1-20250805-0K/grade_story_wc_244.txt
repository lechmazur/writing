<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sadie's contradictory impulses shine when her "jocular mask slipped," earning Marcus's transformation through prior causality; Marcus applies targeted pressure as secondary. Flawless embodiment avoids clichés; voice distinction holds in dialogue idioms. Final phone handoff forecloses isolation with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup in rumor reveal and exchange, landing Charged Poise closure as Marcus "underst[ands] finally that he'd been catalyzed" with conceptual cost of surrendered rarity. Orientation anchors instantly in ivy-claimed station. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in rock-for-purpose trade.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy as "green cathedral of abandoned intentions" recurs to charge final whispers, constraining secretive choreography and mirroring thematic entanglement. Sensory selectivity (metallic moon rock smell) filters via Sadie's expertise. Object-as-setting (vial, thermos) grounds pivotal trade without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rare rock for purpose-connection) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as Myanmar toxin reveal deepens reciprocity calculus, narrowing Marcus's options. Agency in trade forecloses keepsake path with felt cost; moral tension in "technically illegal" peaks without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Reciprocity theme emerges via trade particulars, resonating in final "ivy whispered agreements" reweighting loneliness premise without moral. Sadie’s slip invites ambiguity on altruism; no tidy binary, counter-reading as manipulation lingers. Minor echo in closing line slightly overtells.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Sadie's perceptual bias (smells lunar "absence of Earth"); dialogue subtextual ("close enough for government work") pursues goals. Rhythmic modulation peaks in mask-slip rhythm; no head-hopping, distinct idioms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "whispered to a bartender in Prague" anchors rumor while tilting stakes); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor metaphor mix ("grin sharp enough to cut glass") coherent; no loops, scaffold-free propulsion to ivy-cadenced close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rumor-chain premise synthesizes logistics tropes into fresh "polite anarchy" economy, transforming moon rock cliché via Myanmar toxin payoff. Risky conceptual closure feels inevitable; irreplaceable synthesis of expertise and loneliness cures stakes organically.</comment>
