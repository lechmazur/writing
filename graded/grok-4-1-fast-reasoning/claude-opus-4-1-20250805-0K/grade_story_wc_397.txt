<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlene's motivation as failed euthanasia seeker evolves into embracing endings through concrete micro-choices like ice-watch volunteering; interiority particular via embodied parasol grip and ice-sound perception. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("fold in patience") borders therapy-speak but anchors present via sensory cues. Contradictory impulses (seeking death, finding harmony) act in vigil beat, earning final endurance with palm-pain cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ice sounds build density to calving pattern-break, reconfiguring Marlene's stake from death-seeking to transformation in Charged Poise closure. Orientation anchored early ("drift-ice marina," Arctic relief). Final image ("harmony of endings that refuse to end") delivers legible before/after with conceptual cost of altered reality, parasol constraint persistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice marina setting selective/sensory (cracks as "symphony," breath-ghosts, transparent edge) pressures vigil choice and mirrors internal collapse. Parasol tip as micro-setting handled tactilely, charges final grip-image. Atmosphere tensions destruction/beauty, evolving causally with calving; POV-filtered via ice as "language of conclusion."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning endings' sounds post-change) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via sound-density to calving reversal, deepening to stance crystallization in vigil endurance. Agency in solo watch forecloses isolation path with loose-reality cost felt in radio report and dawn grip. One tightening sufficient; calving beat narrows options visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of endings-as-transformation emerges organically from ice motifs, parasol returns, backstory integration without statement. Final image reweights premise non-literally: "two voices learning the harmony of endings that refuse to end," charging prior suicide/ice parallels with ambiguity. Subtext in grandmother echoes and "beautiful disaster" avoids morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual signature (ice "sings," "folding inward like paper cranes"); syntax/rhythm modulate from descriptive to compressed peak ("sigh more than a scream"). Stable third-limited POV; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("ice holds until it doesn't"). No head-hopping, elisions pattern-taught via sounds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "each crack... different note" advances sound stakes, atmosphere). Metaphors purposeful/coherent ("frozen cemetery," "neural pathways"), taught early without muddle in calving beat. Varied rhythm propels to closure; no loops, minor overwriting in marina descriptions doesn't dull peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: failed euthanasia yields Arctic "euthanasia tourist" learning ice-ending music, parasol tip transforming heirloom to pain-compass. Tropes (disaster relief, survivor's solace) subverted via sound-language and "fold in patience." Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
