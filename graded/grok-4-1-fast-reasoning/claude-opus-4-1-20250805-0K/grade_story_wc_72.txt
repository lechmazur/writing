<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied reactions like Marina's trembling hands and Thessaly's expectation of condemnation vs. nuance create contradictory impulses acting in scene; final endurance (witness role affirmed) earned with felt cost of reputation risk for Marina. Minor unearned ease in telepathic rapport slightly flattens initial pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as cascading visions build to Conceptual Repricing closure where "the weight of her secret had been creating structural weakness all along" makes before/after legible with conceptual cost of lifted judgment. Orientation anchors instantly; one tightening via revelations suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Diving bell, ampoule glow, and air hose constrain ascent and charge final image of threading hose through wall. Sensory details like "kelp forests thread through marble archways" filter through urgent underwater stakes, mirroring internal shifts without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. certainty) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through revelations narrowing Marina's worldview; agency in her nuanced response forecloses black/white history with visible reputational cost. Escalation driven by protagonist perception under lens, cost unmistakable in career-shattering visions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of nuanced morality emerges organically from poison's "purple" mix and Thessaly's impossible choice; final image reconfigures premise without moralizing, offering resonant answer to judgment question. No thematic echo or binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person focalization through Marina with clean telepathic italics; perceptual signature in biased academic lens on "preserved poison." Voice modulates poetically under pressure without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like foxglove visions advancing plot/atmosphere; rhythm varies purposefully, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("dominoes falling upward") coherent but borders muddle in peak reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic statue and poisoned utopia transformed via nuanced ethics; risk in gray morality heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from garden motif to "stone...animate with possibility."</comment>
