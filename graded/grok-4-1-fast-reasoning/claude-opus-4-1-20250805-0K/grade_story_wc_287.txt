<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via trembling fingers and gauge warmth; wistfully pragmatic trait constrains release choice with earned cost in petal reflection; no diagnostic labels, embodied contradictions in tending vs. releasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from petal drop to rower rhythm to gauge wedging as Charged Poise RR closure; orientation anchored early in harbor; cost legible in "felt lighter, unburdened" final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Luminous harbor and barnacle border constrain kneeling/instilling choice and charge closure; gauge as recurring micro-setting reweights from soil to monument; sensory hierarchy via gardener's tactile priorities vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cycle transition signaled early, tightens accumulatively via rower synchronization forcing meditative stance; agency in instilling forecloses rosebush past with felt cost of release; one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of growth transitions emerges organically from gauge repurposing and petal-to-seeds arc; final harbor image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting light-into-dark-corners motif without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature in growth metaphors; rhythmic modulation matches meditative pressure; no head-hopping, purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in closure poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "moonlight like mercury" coherent and propulsive; varied rhythm passes read-aloud; minor overwriting in reflective blocks but no loops or scaffold dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lock gauge as soil-to-monument tool transforms gardening trope; risk in lyric release heightens renewal stakes organically; no derivative templates, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
