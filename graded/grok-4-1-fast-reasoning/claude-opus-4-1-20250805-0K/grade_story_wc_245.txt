<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied interiority shines in tactile language absorption and compass sensations, rooting motivation in gift's history; final realization ("sight would have distracted") earns change with conceptual cost, fulfilling 9+ test via prior sensory causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sonic trail and languages density-build to CR closure at stillpoint; cost legible in ring's cease and carried silence, with orientation anchored early ("ultrasonic forest"); no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bark-touch and soil-whispers constrain path, charging final image where waves converge; tactile/sonic hierarchy reflects POV bias, with ring as micro-setting reweighting closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stillpoint) deepens via melody fragments and language accumulation, narrowing to soul-navigation; agency in following/dowsing forces trade-off, with felt cost in internalized blaze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blindness-as-gift theme emerges organically from sensory particulars, resonant CR reweights premise without moralizing; final image ("carrying the stillpoint") answers emotional-depth question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (frequencies resonating with bones) modulates rhythmically; stable close third-person limited teaches pattern early, paying off in charged poise without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and sensory propulsion; figurative language ("warm honey," "quiet blaze") pattern-taught, coherent without muddle or loops in peak convergence beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synesthesia mapping transforms navigation trope via skin-languages and sonic stillpoint; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at "become the compass."</comment>
