<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to craft spheres from father's memory drives consistent micro-choices like placing the bookmark and handing a sphere to the couple, earning a small relational shift; interiority embodied in sweeping and blowing glass avoids labels. Minor flaw: narration occasionally abstracts contradiction into tidy wisdom rather than simultaneous impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through crafting beats to Charged Poise closure in the couple's arrival and Marina's response, reconfiguring isolation into fragile community with legible conceptual cost of "living in the shadow of old disasters." Orientation anchored early in control room; single scene holds without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ice dripping from tiles and pooling water constrain workspace clearing and mirror internal thaw, charging final image where thawing outside parallels human hearts; selective sensory details like torch's blue flame filter through Marina's priorities. Recurring control panels as shelves evolve with her installation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of crafting inquiry zones tightens accumulatively via seventeen spheres to couple's test-question, forcing stance crystallization in sharing with visible fragility cost; agency in strategic placement and handover forecloses solitary endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically from glassblowing containment mirroring nuclear history, culminating in resonant final image of bookmark marking fear-to-curiosity shift without moralizing; subtext in narrated rituals invites ambiguity on safety's fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in meditative narration of mundane acts; dialogue sparse but subtextual—"Safety is not given"—pursues goal of safe inquiry. Lyrical rhythm modulates from heavy memory to light possibility without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density integrates action, image, narration without loops; rhythm varies with short declarative sentences in crafting beats accelerating propulsion. Minor overwrite in repeated "she narrated/announced/murmured/observed" risks template cadence but stays voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-nuclear returnees and glassblower's question-spheres transforms disaster tropes through lived ritual; risk in self-narration heightens ingenuity, making bookmark's reprise inevitable to closure.</comment>
