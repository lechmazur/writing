<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Driven relic keeper shows contradictory impulses in choosing new song over sealing tradition, embodied in trembling fingers and desperate note combinations; final acceptance of seed earns change with felt cost of past failure. Interiority concrete and particular throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as weaving notes build density to insights and figure's appearance; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in "transform it into a doorway" with conceptual cost of reweighted guardianship, felt in seed's warmth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range and canyon hush constrain path via driftwood markers and thin-reality shimmer; recurring silence charges final image as mountains' "benediction," mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of harvesting insights tightens via weaving success that narrows old sealing option; agency in playing new song drives escalation under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in acknowledged past failure charging seed acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of failure-forward weaving emerges organically from flute's reprise and figure's gesture; final image of driftwood path as message offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting worlds as partners without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in silence as "presence" rather than absence; rhythmic control modulates from hush to deepening during weaving peak, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful silence motif building texture; minor repetition in "silence" variants purposeful under lens, but slight figurative density in weaving metaphors ("braiding," "baton") borders overwrought without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms guardian trope via weaving mechanic and failure repricing; risk in poetic silence accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via flute's evolved purpose.</comment>
