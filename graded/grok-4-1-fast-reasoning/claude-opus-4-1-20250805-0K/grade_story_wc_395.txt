<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied mission patch warmth tying personal loss to digital ghosts; final micro-choice to leave breadcrumbs and join reveals value hierarchy with cost. Minor reflection on father anchors present but borders BRR excess without tilting enough micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via pattern discoveries to CR closure ("Lila Chen became Pattern User 8625"), reweighting absence as presence with conceptual cost legible in profile transformation beat. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mission patch recurs to constrain emotional choice and charge final image; archive towers and substrata selectively guide data dives with POV-biased sensory hierarchy (e.g., "fingers traced the mission patch"). No white-room; details evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover 4827 pattern) tightens accumulatively through breadcrumb revelations narrowing to self-joining; agency in terminal command forecloses normalcy with on-page cost (transformation flicker). Escalation coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of digital presence-in-absence emerges organically from encoded messages and shadow network; final CR image ("in the space between deletion and existence") non-literally answers premise with resonant conceptual cost, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (data archaeology metaphors like "photograph developing in reverse"); rhythmic diction modulates intensity, e.g., crisp commands at peak; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., coordinates recipe integrates action/setting); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, precise syntax propels to closure without overwriting or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of social archive as limbo afterlife echoing Apollo-X signal modulation; risky poetic sci-fi transforms tropes via 4827 frequency link, inevitable in hindsight with bold closure risk.</comment>
