<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via concrete actions like writing on walls with burned poems and teaching arrivals, earning the poet's transformation from solitary to communal leader; shyly unstoppable trait shows in proposing armistice "whispered shyly" yet drawing hundreds. Minor slip in occasional abstract embodiment like "sorrow sink into soil" borders therapy-speak but anchors to present shell cues without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from solitary composition to communal greenhouse, culminating in Charged Poise RR via shell's enduring gardens and dissolving postcard; cost legible in "worn things... instruments of illumination" final image. Orientation anchored early in shell and warped time; one tightening via arrivals drawn by lullabies narrows isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gargantuan shell's acoustics and pulse constrain choices (carry lullabies outward) and charge closure (still breathes joy); selective sensory details like "reef-shadow joy" and "pinholes... new constellations" mirror internal states through action. Micro-setting of postcard-as-worn-tool evolves causally, filtering POV bias toward transformation patterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of pain-to-beauty transformation signaled early via armistice idea, escalates accumulatively as solo verses draw community, reweighting isolation with ongoing cost of "centuries of longing." Agency in cracked-voice lullabies forces trade-offs; visible price in insomnia endurance charges final poise without resolving to tidy victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of pain-beauty coexistence emerges from particulars like crystallized music gardens, offering resonant non-literal answer in "even approaching disasters... slow dances" without moralizing. Postcard motif shifts from reminder to permeating essence, reweighting premise; ambiguity lingers in imperfect music's illumination.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (spirals across scales) modulates rhythmically with intensity, stable single POV; purposeful poetic compression taught early via shell's architecture pays off in closure cadence. No head-hopping or withholding; diction reflects poet's insomniac twilight lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short punchy lines amid flowing verses) propels via image-action integration; no loops or scaffolds, metaphors consistent (photosynthesis, spirals) without muddle in peak reflective beats. Minor register elevation in "photosynthesize" suits voice but risks slight drift; closure image pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shell-greenhouse for emotional alchemy transforms war/refuge tropes via pain-seeds and lullaby spores; risk-taking in centuries-spanning lyric mosaic heightens transformation stakes organically. Postcard's "collisions... slow waltzes" inflects inevitability without gimmick.</comment>
