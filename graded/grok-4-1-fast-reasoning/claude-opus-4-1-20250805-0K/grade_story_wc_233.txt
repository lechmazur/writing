<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via disenchantment driving the climb, with rage felt in "shackles" line; earned transformation as endurance with cost. Minor slip: internal conflict mostly summarized rather than simultaneous impulses in pivotal refusal beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to CR closure in transformation and cycle reveal; cost legible in "kingdom falls tonight." Orientation anchored early; single scene fits scope without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via crumbling path and thinning air; charges final image with cobalt/ember glow mirroring internal reconfiguration. Sensory selectivity sharpens urgency, e.g., "frozen fire" touch revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt payment vs. fall) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to firefly reveal forcing acceptance; agency in climb/acknowledgment forecloses refusal with kingdom cost. Escalation coherent under lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of cursed cycle emerges organically via queen-fireflies and princess dream; resonant CR reweights power bargain without moralizing. Final image answers inheritance question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual bias (dreams as memories); voice texture distinct in "silk drawn across broken glass." Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual; rhythm modulates pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; purposeful recurrence like "bleeding starlight" propels without loops. Minor overwriting in descriptive clusters, but no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of queenly curse into firefly constellation transforms tropes; backwards roses and star-bleed ingenuity inevitable in hindsight. Bold fantasy risks cohere without gimmick.</comment>
