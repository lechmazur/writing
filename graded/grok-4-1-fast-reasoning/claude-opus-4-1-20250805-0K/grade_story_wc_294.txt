<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marcus's perceptive calm roots consistent motives and micro-choices across phases, earning his guardian stasis; Chen's recognition forces relational reconfiguration with cost. Limited on-page contradictory impulses reduce internal depth at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds suggestion density across legible seasonal shards to CR closure in "You're showing us we're building the same circle," with dissolution cost undeniable; pattern taught early, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Circus train cars constrain marker placements and acoustics, charging final bill-wall image; sensory details (rusted tigers, whispers) filter through Marcus's priorities without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dissuade via suggestion) signaled early, escalates texturally through phases to algorithm's phantom thieves; agency in Marcus's tactics narrows options, dissolution cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of self-mapping circles emerges organically from bills, maps, whispers; final "every highway leads home" reconfigures premise non-literally with conceptual cost, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dusky perceptual signature (twilight shadows, eternal games) stable in Marcus's limited third; dialogue subtext sharp in confrontation, advances realization without declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with seasonal cadence, high density integrates action/image; minor metaphor density ("wound healing over") in opening risks overwrite but supports tone without closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of robber inheritance and startup irony transforms tropes; risk in mosaic timeframe heightens circling premise, inevitable in hindsight via TerraLoop's self-fulfilling patterns.</comment>
