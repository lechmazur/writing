<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Root-bound visionary's contradictory impulses (fear-shaking fingers yet tracing scars) act in scene; final anchor realization earned by causal buildup of evidence-collection trait, with visible cost of lifelong fixation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density tightens via clipping-to-maze growth and scar readings toward CR closure ("roots and wings finally, impossibly, the same thing") with conceptual cost of eternal anchoring legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt glade's blue grass parting and earth scars constrain path to center, charging climax; selective sensory hierarchy (waxy leaves warming, silver lines hanging) mirrors internal discovery without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (access intersection) deepens accumulatively through scar linkages narrowing options; agency in kneeling/pressing/tracing forces trade-off, cost felt in root-bound endurance crystallized at signing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of scars/tending as reorganization emerges implicitly via maze-heart covenant; final image non-literally reweights root-bound premise with resonant ambiguity of purpose, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature ("read them like braille") biases noticing toward wounded realities; rhythmic diction modulates with intensity (short sentences in maze growth) without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "roots spreading outward... weaving themselves"); varied rhythm propels via image-charged syntax, no loops or muddled metaphors in peak scar-touch beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-bleed scars and plant-maze anchor transforms quantum/dream tropes; risk in scar-reading method inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes via irreplaceable glade response.</comment>
