<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliza's embodied grief—hands stilling, precise movements echoing Thomas's notes—reveals contradictory impulses toward destruction and mending, earning her final acceptance. Marcus's persistence drives relational crucible without safety-hedging. Minor flaw: Marcus's interiority slightly generic compared to Eliza's specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: oriented by ~50 words (shop entry, brass plate), causal progression from delivery to repair to music via journal/notes. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with cost in Eliza's "deserved worse" acknowledgment, reconfiguring grief. No orientation debt; single scene tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Light shafts through windows constrain perception and charge closure ("blessing what was broken"), with dust motes, brass, gears providing tactile micro-setting that mirrors repair. Sensory hierarchy (visual/tactile dominant) reflects Eliza's focus; shop evolves with storm parting. Final light journey recharges opening image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair as apology) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via realization ("hands stilled") and joint work to music's cadence shift. Eliza's agency in following notes forecloses denial with emotional cost legible in whisper. Minor slip: tightening relies more on texture than sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of deliberate mending emerges organically from repair beats, resonating in music box's hesitant-to-strong melody without statement. Final image ("clockwork heart beat on, steady as absolution") offers non-literal answer reweighting breakage. Borders thematic echo in "choice to transform," but anchored in action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person focalization (Eliza-dominant at peak) with distinct perceptual signature in light/music patterns; dialogue natural/subtextual ("second opinions"). Rhythm modulates with silence/clicks under pressure. No head-hopping; elision of Marcus backstory paid in delivery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short questions amid long descriptives); high density in repair beats advances character/atmosphere. Light metaphors cohere without muddle, though recurrent in peak ("light... blessing") borders overwrite (-0.3). Zero loops; propulsion peaks at ticking heart.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: prison notes guiding sister’s repair transforms redemption trope via clockwork specificity. Risk in poetic light accrual heightens closure without gimmick. No derivative echoes; closure turn inevitable from setup.</comment>
