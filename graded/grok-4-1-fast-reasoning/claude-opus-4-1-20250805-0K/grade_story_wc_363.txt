<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's contradictory impulses surface in silence tasting cherished memories like daughter's first word, compelling the weaving sacrifice; final self-loss earned by generational chain and pocket photo cue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layering revelations to CR closure: new amber bead with hair reconfigures ancestral pattern, legible cost in Mei's empty smiling state post-weave.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Raveling silence as dynamic setting hungers memories during shuttle passes, constraining weave and charging final investigator encounter; bamboo/orchard anchors bias selective sensory hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (daughter's rescue) deepens accumulatively as each pass sacrifices memories, agency in stringing bead forces trade-off, cost unmistakable in lost identity at empty loom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silenced messages' power emerges via ancestral sacrifices mirroring Mei's; final bead/puzzle reprise non-literally answers transmission's worth, reweighting legacy with quiet resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in textile diction ("raveled," "warp thread," "picking up stitches"); rhythmic modulation intensifies ritual under silence's pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image ("shuttle pass" erases memories) with purposeful weave metaphors; varied rhythm propels without loops, peak clarity in bead's hair proof.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-weaving magic realism transforms silence/orchard tropes; bold CR risks conceptual payoff in tear-bead, inevitable from early puzzle seed.</comment>
