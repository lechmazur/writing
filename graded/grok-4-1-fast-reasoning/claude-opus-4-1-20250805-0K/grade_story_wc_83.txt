<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Amira's motivation rooted in sister's geode drives micro-choices like pressing it to scanner and enlisting Chen, with embodied bleak exhilaration; internal conflict emerges in steady voice amid stakes. Chen applies secondary pressure via hesitation before downloading. Minor slip: Chen's turn feels abrupt without deeper relational crucible, but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: cooldown enables scan (inciting), readings spike to reveal patterns (tightening), alarm forces download (climax) to CR closure where data transmits despite security, with legible cost in "They'll destroy this... Let them." Orientation anchored early via geode/Kandahar. One tightening suffices; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Geode as recurring object constrains choices (pressed to scanner) and charges final image ("clutching the now-warm geode"); observatory's elevation "thins boundary," sterile light, Earth scars mirror theme via windows. Sensory selective: heavy palm, glow of possibility. No white-room; spatial coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture pooled potential) signaled early, tightens via spiking readings/alarm narrowing time; agency in adjusting frequency, downloading forces trade-off (capture risk). Cost visible in security burst but data safe. Causal lens escalation clean; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of returning stolen futures emerges organically via geode scan revealing reservoirs, final Earth-scarred image as CR reweights violence's cost without moralizing. Subtext in "Energy cannot be destroyed"; no tidy binary. Resonance from particulars like sister's unborn children.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Amira; perceptual bias (feels presence via geode) distinct. Dialogue natural/subtextual ("You knew"), advances plot. Rhythm modulates under stress (short sentences at alarm); no head-hopping, diction POV-fit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied syntax; vivid images like "probability clouds that shouldn't exist" without muddle. Minor paraphrase near "pools of unused potential" (-0.3), but no loops touching closure; ear-test clean, no artifacts in peak alarm beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum grief (geode records unlived futures) transforms drone-strike trauma into sci-fi hunt; risk in CR closure ("stolen dreams... flood back") inevitable from particulars. Bold elevation premise heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
