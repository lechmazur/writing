<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in paint-stained hands and drifting into liminal space reveals methodically hopeful trait under creative drought pressure; micro-choices like dipping brush align with motives. Final communal gathering earns change from isolation via prior memory anchors. Minor tidiness in epiphany slightly undercuts contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from solitary painting to online flood and gatherings, holding to CR closure where final moonlit painting reconfigures lost languages as living in kindness, with insomnia cost felt as ongoing bridge. Orientation anchored early in greenhouse; one tightening via posting suffices. Persistent brush constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse micro-setting constrains via steam whispers and glass moon lattices, charging closure image; sensory hierarchy (saffron taste, lunar glow) reflects Mira's priorities. Details evolve with painting warmth, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism. Body/tools like moon-tipped brush constrain choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of creative drought/proving kindness signaled early tightens via painting success and response flood under accumulative lens, foreclosing isolation with communal cost. Agency in posting forces deepening; moral calculus of insomnia as gift adds tension. Minor abstractness in initial stake legibility holds back higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of kindness transcending languages emerges from concrete memories/dumplings, painting scripts, and responses, reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; protagonist arc inextricable from question. Quiet CR lands non-literal answer with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (moonlight as frost, saffron hours) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from drift to communal poise. No dialogue to judge. Purposeful compression in memories taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "moon-tipped brush seemed to pulse" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud. Selective metaphors like "silver lattices" purposeful without muddle in peak painting beat. Minor figurative density in opening but no loops or scaffold dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of insomnia, lost scripts, and kindness via brush transforms trope of artist's block; rooftop communal pivot feels inevitable from particulars. Bold lyric risk-taking heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
