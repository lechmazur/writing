<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's interiority shines in recognizing dream architecture and transcribing under ghost pressure, with contradictory diver-whisperer traits driving her endurance; earned change in realizing her messenger role forecloses casual diving with mission cost. Minor backstory block anchors present but slightly dilutes peak embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as visions densify to formula reveal and 12-globe mission, with on-page closure as Charged Poise in constellations mapping wrecks—cost felt in "patient" dead and her renewed dives. Orientation anchors immediately in shrine/dive gear; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Candlelight precisely constrains formula reveal ("struck at the proper angle"), charging final borrowed-starlight image; sensory selection (frost faces, ice caves voice) filters through Marina's priorities without catalog. Evolving details (rivulets, blooming visions) mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvage antidote) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via dreams to global quest, forcing stance crystallization in packing globe; agency in whispering/placing/transcribing shows trade-offs, with legible cost in fading chemist and endless wrecks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging pure from wreckage emerges organically via melted globe's persistent pattern and final "wreckage" image reweighting connections; resonant non-literal close in Marina climbing with starlight avoids moralizing, inviting ambiguity on dead's patience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (reading frost windows); voice texture modulates poetically yet controlled, as in "wind through ice caves"; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, chemist's line pursuing goal without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "frost patterns... breath on glass" advances setting/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops/artifacts; purposeful figuratives like "dream architecture" enhance without muddling peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diving/ghost-dreams/antidote globes transforms tropes via encoded plastic cities; risk in lyric visions pays off inevitably at constellation map, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
