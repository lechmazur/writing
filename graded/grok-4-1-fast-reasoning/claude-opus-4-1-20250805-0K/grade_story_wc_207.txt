<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vera's sensibly eccentric trait yields contradictory impulses—collecting vs. crossing—that peak in the decision to retreat with the vial, earning the renunciation through prior psychometric buildup. Interiority embodies via pulsing compass and trembling fingers. Minor slip in epiphanic summary ("understanding that bypassed thought") slightly abstracts the climax embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory visions and petrichor intensifies to Charged Poise closure where Vera forecloses crossing ("not foolishly brave"), with cost legible in the shimmering wall she leaves. Orientation anchors early in descent. Single-shard scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Phosphorescent lagoon and mineral dampness constrain the kneeling psychometry and vial-filling, charging the final shimmer on the far wall. Sensory hierarchy (scent primacy) reflects Vera's profession. Limestone throat passage mirrors internal spiral without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to capture otherworldly petrichor tightens accumulatively via rippling surface and compass spin, forcing renunciation trade-off at "she could follow them... But she was sensibly eccentric." Cost felt in foreclosed bravery. One deepening suffices, but lacks secondary loss like vial risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of "doors on their hinges" emerges via petrichor visions and final vial image reweighting ordinary air against impossible rain, offering non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in Hartley vanishing complicates tidy pursuit. Resonant ambiguity lingers in "it collected you."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with scent-biased perceptual signature ("petrichor unlike any") modulates rhythm from hushed descent to intensifying glow. Prose texture distinct in syntax like spiraling passage simile. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with lines like "vials clinking softly" advancing atmosphere and action; rhythm varies from short gasps to flowing realizations. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Minor register elevation ("primordial") fits voice without drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Petrichor as memory-portal and psychometric compass synthesize fresh interdimensional hush, transformed via sensibly eccentric restraint into charged poise. Risky lyric build pays off in vial's "impossible rain" without gimmick. Inevitable in hindsight from early clues.</comment>
