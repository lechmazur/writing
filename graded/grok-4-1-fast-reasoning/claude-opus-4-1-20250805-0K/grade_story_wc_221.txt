<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of isolation versus helping act in scene through touching and sketching; final endurance as beacon earned by prior curse-as-compass causality with isolation cost legible in "blessed pariah" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of reflections and sketches builds to Charged Poise closure; pressing rice paper against compass triggers decisive light leak and crew return with conceptual cost of her transformation into fixed point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gilded compass rose and rice paper as recurring micro-settings constrain choices (pressing activates) and charge final pulsing heartbeat image; crystalline walls void anchors orientation early without white-room drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating lost souls tightens accumulatively via sketching that narrows her isolation options; agency in transforming curse costs prior freedom, legible in crew's honeyed movement toward her.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of navigation-through-loss emerges organically from sketching custom and compass; final image of becoming lighthouse reconfigures "true north" premise without moralizing, reweighting isolation with resonant cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward time glimpses and remembered starlight; rhythmic lyric compression taught early modulates with sketching intensity, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "taffy" and "swimmers through honey" integrated into action; minor repetition of "gilded compass rose applique" contained, no loops dulling closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-dilation SF with ancestral sketching transforms isolation trope into beacon role; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
