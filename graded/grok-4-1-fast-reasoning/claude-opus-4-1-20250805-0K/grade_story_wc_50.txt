<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via grandmother's peripheral technique shows contradictory impulses between direct gaze and edges; final gear adjustment earns realization with cost of non-repair, revealing values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as reflection densities build to CR: "Mara carefully adjusted the largest gear... blueprint of malfunction"; cost legible in leaving unfixed, storing secretly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marble cavern constrains via light angles and pool reflections enabling future glimpses; charges final cradle image, mirroring internal preservation theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of documenting time slivers deepens accumulatively with pre-echoes and overload realization; agency in mirrors/gear forces trade-off of broken over fixed, cost felt in ascent.</comment>
