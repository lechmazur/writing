<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between inherited fire and chosen compassion acts in ritual micro-choices like sifting sand and filling coin; final talisman ties them with embodied tears as cost. Earned renunciation of pure opposition. Minor therapy-speak in "scars can sing" but anchored in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sand-sifting to memory interleaves to grafting closure as Charged Poise RR, reconfiguring legacy with recognition tears on page. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon, black sand, kelp constrain ritual choices and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (wind shifts, ripples) reflects firefighter bias. Details evolve with action, mirroring internal graft.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform fire legacy) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via anchored memories to ritual tightening; agency in grafting forecloses denial with tears cost. Minor abstractness in unmaterialized opposition risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of destruction-to-renewal emerges from sand/flame-water graft, final dune-climb image reweights premise without statement. Resonant via kelp touch as forgiveness. Borders echo in "scars can sing" but emergent from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in "gracefully alert precision" modulates rhythm with ritual intensity; diction/rhythm heighten charged poise at talisman tie.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm accelerates to closure; no loops/artifacts, metaphors cohere (sand as "volcanic memory"). Strategic telling in memories anchors present without drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh ritual synthesis of arsonist daughter/firefighter trope via obsidian graft transforms legacy; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes organically.</comment>
