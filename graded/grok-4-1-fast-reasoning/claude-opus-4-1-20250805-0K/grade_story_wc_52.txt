<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in transformed hands and knife strokes; contradictory grief (temporary smoke vs. crystallized artifact) acts simultaneously during carving. Final endurance of "moving with" earned by prior micro-choices under kettle pressure. No unearned epiphanies; traits shown through precise actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from first cuts to clock center, reweighting grief via pattern break in numerals. Closure as Charged Poise in rough clock face holding time, cost felt in "transformed but undiminished" hands. Orientation anchored in opening lines; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Skylight rain shadows constrain mood and mirror internal circles; ash scent and kettle steam integrate tactilely into action. Kettle as micro-setting times cuts, charging final rust-hued sun image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific, selective for carving urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest loss lessons) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative deepening: realizations layer as carving speeds with kettle rise, narrowing to presence persistence. Agency in purposeful faster cuts forecloses "moving on" with felt cost in transformed daily approach. One tightening sufficient, coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from wood revealing memory parallel to love's crystallization; clock face shifts ring motifs non-literally at end. Resonant final image reweights temporality premise without moralizing. Complexity in grief's persistence avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature in grain-noticing and precise cuts; rhythmic modulation accelerates with whistle. No head-hopping; diction controlled, sensory bias character-specific. Voice as character: syntax mirrors deliberate haunting practicality.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "knife found the wood's heart" advances action, motif, emotion). Varied rhythm propels via kettle cadence; no loops, coherent metaphors (circles containing life). Zero artifacts dull closure image of clock essence contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lion blank becomes handless clock, transforming grief tropes via wood-memory rule-set. Risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes without obscuring; non-obvious angle on loss as harvest inevitable in hindsight. Bold carving divergence from Thomas's lion.</question>
