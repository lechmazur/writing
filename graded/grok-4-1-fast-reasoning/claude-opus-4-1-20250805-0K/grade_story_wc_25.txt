<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to prove whispers over shouts roots consistently in traits like gait-reading and map-layering, culminating in earned win via Chen's concession. Interiority embodied in coin's warmth and key-tapping shows particular observation under storm pressure. Minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak navigation beat prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: patterns of maps, gaits, echoes build to CR closure when Chen takes coin, reweighting authority with conceptual cost of ignored warnings legible in graffitied marks. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in port labyrinth. No slips touch ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Storm aurora and container echoes constrain navigation choices, charging final amphitheater revelation; key and maps as micro-settings enable tactics. Sensory hierarchy (gait over visuals) reflects Marcus's bias. Recurrent walls mirror whispers' persistence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (challenge proof) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as procession grows and XB-471 reached, forcing Chen's stance crystallization. Agency in quiet leading forecloses dismissal path with her amazed "You win." Entry to 8+ via trade-off legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of whispers' reach emerges from particulars like graffitied validations and coin handoff, reweighting loud authority without statement. Final image of Marcus teaching gait rhythm offers non-literal answer to premise. Resonant via accumulated irony of directors leaning in.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable limited-POV perceptual signature in gait/echo noticing; voice texture modulates with storm's groan to charged poise. Dialogue subtextual ("Your challenge. You win.") pursues goals naturally. Minor register steadiness under stress prevents higher.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, e.g., short storm sentences accelerate; no loops, purposeful "whisper" recurrence ties theme. Minor figurative density in aurora "green fire" fits without muddle. Clean propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of port labyrinth as acoustic maze navigated by gaits/echoes transforms tropes; risk in non-visual storm nav pays off in coin's reprise. Inevitable hindsight via mapped patterns heightens stakes organically.</comment>
