<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—yearning for freedom via the walnut yet choosing to give it away to save lives—act in scene, earning her endurance with visible cost in the final return to the trees. Interiority concrete via walnut handling and blueprint study. Flawless under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from routine to guiding fevered child, culminating in Charged Poise closure ("But tonight, she'd saved two more lives, and that was enough") with felt cost of self-binding. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via child suffices. Lens unambiguous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inverted trees and mechanical birds constrain choices (herding travelers, needing impressions); frost clock charges final image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (gauge precision amid crisis). Micro-setting (walnut, blueprint) recharges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide while bound) signaled early; density escalation via sick child forces nut trade-off, narrowing freedom option under Accumulative lens. Agency in graceless impressions and endurance; cost unmistakable in silhouettes departing with seed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of inverted duty/freedom emerges via walnut reprise and blueprint, reweighting premise in final image without moralizing. Subtext in "lies that would save them"; resonant non-literal answer to caretaking question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (precise timings, impressions as "clumsy dance"); voice modulates rhythmically under stress. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("lucky charm"); no head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts (e.g., no paraphrase in guiding beat). Figuratives purposeful (copper wings, grasping roots); clean mechanics elevate pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inverted orchard curse, impression-gift, seed-binding transforms tropes organically. Risk in graceless tone heightens stakes; non-obvious blueprint anchor inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
