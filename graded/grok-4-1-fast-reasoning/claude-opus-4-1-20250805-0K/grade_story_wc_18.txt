<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's grounded trait and micro-choices compel the ritual effectively, revealing values through actions like selecting mirrors; astronomer's desperation motivates credibly but lacks embodied contradiction acting in scene. Final hand-mirror gift earns his change with felt acceptance cost. Minor slip: limited interiority for astronomer weakens relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build in mirrors/fog/breathing to Charged Poise closure; hand-mirror reconfigures dream from chase to inhabit with legible opportunity cost in fading vision. Orientation anchored early in workshop/orchard/fog. Single scene coherent, no shards/transitions needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fog and salvaged mirrors constrain choices (flow in during ritual, supply memories) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (touch for Elara, crystallized prisms) vivid/selective. Ruined orchard evolves causally with vision, mirroring internal boundless shift. Recurring fog droplets as lenses purposeful, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture vision) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via breathing sync/resonance to reversal when whisper breaks pattern, forcing hand-mirror trade-off. Agency in Elara's ritual/astronomer's participation; cost visible in fade and impermanent carry. Escalation coherent under lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries as illusions emerges organically from ritual events/mirrors; final image ("fog and stars still danced... permanent residents") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting capture to inhabit, with conceptual cost of acceptance. No moralizing; ambiguity in dream's portability lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV (Elara-dominant perceptual bias in glass-touch) with clean distance; voice texture distinct in poetic rhythm modulating to crystalline harmonics. Dialogue subtextual ("chasing a runaway dream") advances goals naturally. No head-hopping, perceptual signature in fog/light noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fog crystallized into tiny prisms that caught the dying light" advances setting/action/atmosphere); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (air solidifies into glass sheets). Propulsion syncs scene acceleration in vision bloom/fade.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirrors as intention-windows and fog-stars ritual transforms dream-chase trope; breathing/ sextant fragments organically drive turns. Risky lyric vision risks whimsy but heightens stakes coherently (+0.3). Final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars.</comment>
