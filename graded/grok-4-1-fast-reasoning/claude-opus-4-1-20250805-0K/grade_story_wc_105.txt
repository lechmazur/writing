<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of synesthesia as character-particular trait drives motivation from grandfather's betrayal to final peace; contradictory pursuit of "frequency of betrayal" resolves in earned CR with cellular cost legible in final lines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via layering discoveries (notebooks, forge) to on-page CR closure; cost undeniable in "roots releasing soil" realization reconfiguring trust's duality without causal break; orientation anchored in opening greenhouse image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sunken orchard and shipwrecks constrain imprinting action while charging final image; aurora's colors filter through synesthesia POV, evolving causally with forge glow and hull groans for lived-in pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hearing trust's break) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through prototype failures to imprinting success narrowing options; agency in forge work forecloses prior "failed" path with felt cellular/time cost in climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of imprinting (sounds, memories, cells) emerges organically from particulars like "negative space of sound," culminating in non-literal CR answer—"sound of trust breaking...indistinguishable from...being born"—reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct synesthetic perceptual signature (aurora as "rainfall on leaves"); rhythmic compression modulates pressure, prose syntax mirrors accumulating insight without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion (e.g., "cells dividing normally...tumors of stress") with varied rhythm; no loops, metaphors cohere purposefully in peak forge beat without muddling closure image.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, cellular betrayal, and auditory absences transforms climate ruin trope; risk-taking in CR closure heightens stakes via irreplaceable "held breath of impending disappointment" patterning.</comment>
