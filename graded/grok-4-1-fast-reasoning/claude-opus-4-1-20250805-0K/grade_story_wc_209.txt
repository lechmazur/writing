<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as quietly driven artist intensifies credibly through seasonal painting, embodied in stained fingertips and candlelit choices; internal shift to generational continuer earned without epiphany dump. Minor flaw: reflective summaries of seasons slightly abstract contradictory impulses rather than dramatizing them in pivotal solstice beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hidden layers builds to solstice CR where postcards reprice as instructions, foreclosing overt revelation with conceptual cost of eternal hiding legible in "left tucked behind a loose panel." Orientation anchored early in pavilion/postcards; seasonal shards pattern-taught without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pavilion's amber resin constrains pigments and charges final image of snow-gathered roof mirroring dormant murals; sensory filter (candlelight, shifting pigments) reflects artistic bias. Cathedral backstory integrates via concrete cue (etched glass), evolving with action; no white-room, spatial coherence flawless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reckon with postcards' mystery) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via layered painting tightening to solstice deepening that reweights knowledge; agency in final brushstroke/hiding forecloses daylight scrutiny with felt cost of perpetual secrecy. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of umbral tenderness emerges from particulars (night blooms in shadows vs. sun scrutiny), resonating in final image of stained fingers carrying ungiven gift without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "someone...would see" without tidy resolution. Protagonist arc inextricable from hidden truths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (artistic attunement to light/shadow shifts); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates seasonally, compressing beautifully at solstice ("touched her brush to the final section"). No head-hopping or withholding; voice particular, inference calibrated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer motif/action (e.g., "petals that caught moonlight like memories"); minor overwriting in repeated hush/petals near close borders template cadence but pattern-taught as voice. Zero loops/scaffold; rhythm varies, read-aloud silken; proofreading clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of generational artist-secret-passing via night cereus transforms artist-mystery trope; risk in lyric seasonal elision heightens stakes of hiddenness without gimmick. Final CR inevitable from established particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
