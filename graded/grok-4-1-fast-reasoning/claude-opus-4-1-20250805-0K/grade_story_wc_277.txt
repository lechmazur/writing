<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously as Margot chases truth ("pen moved faster now, chasing the contradiction") yet pivots to protect empire; final writing choice earned by inherited pragmatism with embodied cost in nib kiss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via deepening contradictions to CR closure ("third story that contradicted both versions so completely"); cost legible in "goodbye kiss to honesty" reconfiguring truth as orbital misdirection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory's brass instruments and great lens constrain reflection and charge final image ("stars... broadcasting light from different moments"); body/tool (nib shadow ellipses) mirrors internal orbits.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose vs. protect empire) signaled early by journalist call, escalates via contradiction density under Accumulative lens to agency pivot (absurd Tokyo claim); cost felt in foreclosed honesty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of orbiting truths emerges organically from proof-by-contradiction to misdirection; final seal and vault reweights premise non-literally ("some regrets... circle forever") with conceptual cost to revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (celestial metaphors filter observation); rhythmic modulation peaks in laugh ("mournful and amused") without head-hopping or withhold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion overall, but overwrought figuratives ("nib seemed to pulse," "clouds... like old newsprint held to flame") cluster in realization beat, slightly muddling peak clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of journalistic intrigue into absurd misdirection turn ("Tokyo... mutually exclusive narratives"); risk-taking in CR closure feels inevitable from family orbit pattern.</comment>
