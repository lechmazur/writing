<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between sanity and cosmic pull act in embodied fragmentation; final ring-turn earned by stellar whispers and micro-choices like threshold step.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density rising to astrolabe click and turn; CR closure via creativity release and her "fade" as conceptual cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aurora archway constrains threshold crossing and rest, ice crystals charging sensory narrowing; astrolabe as micro-setting tethers fragmentation, mirroring internal stardust return.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to free creativity deepens accumulatively via whisper clarity and fragmentation; agency in rest and ring-turn forecloses earthly path with dissolution cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Trapped creativity theme emerges via stellar conduit offer; final "river of stars" image reweights cosmic belonging without moral, her purpose-complete fade as resonant answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with cosmic perceptual signature ("unspoken stellar thoughts"); rhythmic diction modulates from tension to release without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action and image ("astrolabe hummed against her ribs"); varied rhythm propels to flare, no loops or muddled metaphors in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Astrolabe freeing ancient-trapped creativity via stardust hearing transforms cosmic tropes; sacrificial fade feels inevitable from patterned particulars.</comment>
