<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reckless idealism drives descent and bite despite keeper's warning, with contradictory impulses embodied in trembling fingers and dusky resolve; earned fusion at climax reveals hierarchy of values with permanent binding cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of setting and reflection builds to RR closure in apple bite and card crumbling, with legible conceptual cost of fused fates; orientation anchored early in descent with card.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard with roots through bones constrains reaching the pulsing apple and charges final brightening ascent; sensory details (phosphorescent glow, whispering branches) filtered through Mara's meaning-inlaying perception mirror internal expansion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to patch soul tightens via keeper confrontation and card realization, forcing bite agency under accumulative deepening; unmistakable cost in "trammel your own fate" warning realized as transformative binding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of rewoven shared destinies emerges organically through apple fusion and card ash promise, offering resonant non-literal answer to reckless mending without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-POV perceptual signature in "inlaying meaning everywhere" biases details character-specifically; dialogue subtextual as keeper probes "What of your unfinished story?"; rhythmic control heightens bite intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures; propulsion varies rhythm in peak bite ("Light flooded through her") without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh catacomb orchard premise transforms fate tropes via bartered fruits and fused paths; risk of fantasy grounded in emotional specificity inevitable at fusion.</comment>
