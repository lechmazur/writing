<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Proprioceptively embodied interiority and micro-choices under trauma pressure, like "muscles locked in remembered positions," earn the final teaching renunciation; contradictory survival geometry repurposed as mercy reveals values hierarchy with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density and pattern realization tighten to Charged Poise closure in strap removal and forest entry; "inverted the motion" delivers on-page RR with legible release cost, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>UV forest and enhanced body constrain choices (visible paths only to her) and charge final image of Fibonacci moss teaching; selective sensory hierarchy (infrared signatures, pulsing fronds) mirrors internal transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of trauma-to-mercy math signaled early, escalates accumulatively through tremor data to strap inversion narrowing victimhood path; child approach crystallizes agency with embodied cost, though deepening leans epiphanic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of mercy reciprocals emerges from particulars like "every measurement of pain had its inverse equation," resonating in final smile; strong but −0.5 for repeated "mathematics of mercy" articulations bordering echo in peak lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (geometric precision, spectral overlays) modulates rhythm under stress; no head-hopping, diction biased to enhanced calculus feels inevitable and distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic variety propels from waking to forest; minor −0.4 for "precise/exact" stem repetition in proprioception beats (e.g., "exact angle," "precise angles"), but pattern-taught and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of proprioceptive trauma as math engine transforms exile trope; risk in UV sanctuary calculus heightens stakes organically, inevitable in "seventeen facial muscles" freedom image.</comment>
