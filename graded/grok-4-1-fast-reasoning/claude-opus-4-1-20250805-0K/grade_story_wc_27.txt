<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Awkward confidence shown through embodied gestures ("perpetually stood on the edge of falling into grace") transforms into "ancient and sure" at closure, earning the final stance via prior sensory buildup; contradictory impulses subtle but act in scene through deliberate steps amid off-balance poise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of hum and resonance tightens to Charged Poise/CR closure ("thunderous serenity... everything becomes possible"), with cost legible in reconfigured rebellion view and poised commitment to bring others; orientation anchored early, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stones and barefoot soles constrain choices (tingle threshold, hum through bones) and charge final image ("stood barefoot on stones older than memory"); selective sensory hierarchy (vibration below hearing, cold metal) mirrors internal escalation without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reignite stalled rebellion) signaled early and deepens via hum intensification and machinery resonance under Accumulative lens, narrowing to agency in standing at heart; cost felt in foreclosed "failed" view, charging poised tomorrow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of revolution as generational "song" emerges organically from opera glasses reprise and circle star maps shifting to "orchestra warming up," offering non-literal resonant answer in final engine cough without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (starlight pulses, bone-settled hum) and rhythmic modulation to charged closure; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm supports propulsion, purposeful "hum" repetition builds texturally without loops; minor overwriting in metaphors ("cathedral of rust," "thunderous serenity") coherent and voice-motivated, no artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi spaceport with pre-colonial stones and opera glasses as star-map lenses transforms rebellion trope into harmonic lull; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative drive heightens stakes organically.</comment>
