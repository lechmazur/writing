<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation roots deeply in her grandmother's lost name, embodied in tears and urgent micro-choices like retrieving the orchid. Contradictory impulses surface in foxglove regret amid systematic precision during the capture. Final placement earns closure through 30-year search converging on this ritual. No stock phrasing; voice particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from chime's whisper to crack widening and split, delivering RR closure with cost in "bamboo tube finally split in two." Orientation anchors instantly in opal library. Single scene holds without shards or ambiguity. Inciting song echo and lamp-light escalation tighten coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glass orchids and crystalline walls constrain choices, with bamboo chime as micro-setting charging climax and Wall of Lost Names final image. Sensory details (dawn light, chime undertone) filter through Mira's reverent bias. Atmosphere of timeless isolation pressures solitude without stasis. No white-room; lived-in tactile use evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture name before chime breaks) signaled early, escalates via lamp action widening crack under Accumulative lens. Agency in practiced shaping forecloses path with visible cost (chime's sigh and split). One decisive deepening suffices; pressure coheres to Charged Poise. No abstract stakes; visceral on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preservation as rebellion emerges from orchid capture and Wall placement, reweighting loss-to-remembrance without statement. Final image ("Solmieth's orchid... forever found") resonates non-literally, charging prior motifs. Subtext in deserted marvels avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in her future preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of precise reverence (e.g., "gently systematic precision"). Lyrical diction modulates rhythmically with urgency in capture beat. No head-hopping or elision; compression purposeful and taught. Voice distinct, syntax reflects methodical mind under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks. Peak capture beat propels cleanly without figurative muddle ("crack spreading like lightning"). Minor overwriting in opening descriptions (-0.1) but purposeful for tone, not obscuring closure. Read-aloud cadence breathes with scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-orchids in cloud library transforms nostalgia tropes via glass acoustics and name-preservation logic. Risky lyric world commits fully, with chime's resonance as non-obvious turn inevitable in hindsight. No derivatives; particulars (Solmieth syllables) anchor bold vision.</comment>
