<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to map sky-abyss dialogue intensifies credibly into belonging via patient observation, with embodied wonder (tracing constellations) and micro-choice to inhabit mystery; Chen applies light pressure via exhaustion/questions. Internal harmony outweighs contradiction, but earned realization at "found her place" carries felt cost of transience. Minor summary of approach slightly abstracts traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from feather omen to glow/fish/jellies, tightening via pattern recognition to CR closure—"city pulsed once more and went dark"—with undeniable conceptual cost of impermanence reweighting belonging. Orientation anchored early (Mira, facility, Thymal). Single shard with seamless transition; no slips touch ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting vividly constrains via dome glass/vibrations pressing against pulsing ruins, charging final pulse-dark image; sensory hierarchy (glows, schools reflecting) filters through Mira's astrological bias. Micro-setting (tank feather) evolves causally. Recurrent channels/spirals mirror internals without overtness, environment indispensable to CR.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (city's dreaming via alignment) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through glow spread/fish patterns to cadence shift at jellies/exhale; agency in Mira's interpretation forecloses mechanical solving for inhabiting. Cost legible in feather's dissolution/transience felt at close. One deepening suffices, coherent pressure without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of inhabiting eternal sky-abyss conversation emerges organically from feather/glow/feather reprise, culminating in resonant CR—"some mysteries weren't meant to be solved but inhabited"—reweighting premise without moral. Complexity in wonder's shadow (sleeping city) lingers plausibly. Final pulse-dark answers belonging question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (star-corals, shy creatures); voice modulates rhythm from precise ("edges crimped and blackened") to charged poise at close. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Chen's exhaustion vs Mira's insight), distinct idiom advances. No head-hopping; diction fits ingenious watcher.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm/syntax propel accumulatively without loops or scaffolds; figurative layer (e.g., "shadowseam wonder") coherent/pattern-taught, no muddle in peak glow/fish beats. Propulsion peaks at "water itself seemed to breathe with light." Zero artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrology-underwater ruins transforms lost-city trope via star-filtered fathoms/coral-galactic spirals, with non-obvious CR payoff. Bold lyric risk heightens belonging stakes organically. Irreplaceable particulars (burnt feather ritual) feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
