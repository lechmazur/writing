<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation and micro-choices under time pressure, as in trembling hands and "carefully reckless" decision to rewrite promise-for-promise; contradictory impulses between caution and exuberance act in scene. Final restoration earned by prior discoveries with felt cost of potential war. Minor smoothness in epiphanies slightly undercuts peak ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of linguistic discoveries culminating in Charged Poise closure: manuscript packed and ink well clinking before summit, with cost legible in "before paths diverge irreversibly." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via glowing ink reconfigures options. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass ink well as micro-setting constrains choices (dipped for writing, glows to affirm truth) and charges final image ("clinked softly... pearl-light ready"); dust-filled air thrums with pressure, sensory details selective via scholarly POV. Spatial choreography coherent through spiral stairs exit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher before summit to avert war) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through pattern recognition and ink glow narrowing options; agency in restoration forecloses mistranslation path with time cost ("three hours"). One deepening sufficient, cost felt in reckless risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth as symphony emerges organically from interconnected promises and final restoration image, reweighting silence into harmony without moralizing. Resonance in ink well's glow-to-clink reprise ties particulars. Avoids binaries via councils' mutual reinforcement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (symbols "danced," promises "crystallizing like frost"); rhythmic modulation builds to exhilarated laugh and smile. Lyrical diction purposeful for accumulative texture, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in metaphors ("frost patterns," "tuning fork") during peak decoding slightly muddles propulsion; no loops or scaffolds. Final line recharges ink well image cleanly. Read-aloud ear strong overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dead language as living bonds via Verithanic symphonies transforms diplomacy trope; ink well's pearl-glow payoff feels inevitable from setup. Risky "carefully reckless" scholar premise heightens stakes organically.</comment>
