<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's contradictory impulses—genius spy feigning drool and nonsense songs—act simultaneously in Crane's intrusion, forcing micro-choices that encode intel; final genuine smile earns stasis amid exposure risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds intel density to charged poise closure in "threading one last secret"; Crane's "observatory closed tomorrow" confirms coup timing with tightening cost in narrowed window.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eternal flame as micro-setting constrains thread extraction and charges final harmony image; cobalt dome's rattling wind mirrors whispers, filtering through Vera's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of final chart encoding deepens via Crane's light footstep detection, forcing disguise endurance that forecloses exposure path; felt cost in deliberate rocking narrows options under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Echoed silence between words" motif reweights unheard stories in final "threading one last secret into the vast, silent map," resonating without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "stars whisper such lovely secrets when you poke them with needles"; dialogue subtext sharp in Vera's "dancing bears" encoding vs. officers' dismissals.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density in "extracted a single flame with her needle, threading it through the eye like captured starlight" propels without loops or overwriting; rhythmic variety sustains momentum to wind-rattled close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Embroiderer spy encoding coups in star charts via flame thread transforms espionage trope organically; "hemoglobin code" blood smear inventive, risking discovery for fresh synthesis.</comment>
