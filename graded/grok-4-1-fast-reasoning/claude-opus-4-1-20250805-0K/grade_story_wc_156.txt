<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elena's methodical-playful contradiction acts vividly in the laugh amid restoration war, earning her final choice to seal the coin with felt cost of renouncing certainty; Marcus applies light pressure without diluting her arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (sounds, spirals) builds to CR closure in "I choose differently," with coin flip as tightening that reconfigures nested loops; orientation anchors early, cost legible in resealing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden's acoustic panels constrain surreal escalation via reflected future-voice, charging final mural-stilling image; sensory integration (humming panels, heartbeat footsteps) mirrors internal states without symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs. wonder) signaled early, deepens via voice-echo reversal narrowing options; agency peaks in coin flip/choice with on-page cost of foreclosing understanding, legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of recursive choice emerges implicitly from coin-spiral interplay, resonant in final "paint[ing] over" reweighting prior nests without moral; subtext in playful laugh invites ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (artistic fractals, pulsing strokes) modulates rhythm under surreal stress; sparse dialogue carries subtext naturally, distinguishing voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion peaks in coin-spin multiplicity; minor figurative density in "dreams began to move" risks slight overwrites but integrates without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic surrealism and hobo nickel transforms time-loop trope via specific garden rules; risky nested-reality risk heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
