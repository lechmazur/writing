<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's poet's hunger drives micro-choices like commanding "Pattern it forward," earning the final release of the rope with felt moral cost in carrying time's weight in his bones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through layered revelations building to CR closure in the unprompted final layer and rope's repositioning, with cost legible in the "eternal joke" laugh.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Terra-cotta walls constrain visions ("pressed his palm... feeling vibrations") and charge the final singing walls, filtering through Marcus's textured perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake of complete understanding tightens via density of moral layers, agency in commands narrowing to endurance of complexity, cost tasted in "hollows in her soul."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of moral texture emerges organically from rope's history, resonant in final image of rope "waiting in its patient coil" reweighting choices without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature ("time had texture... rough like the rope's weave") stable in single POV, rhythm modulating with revelations' intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via layered syntax varying with pressure; no loops, purposeful metaphors like "time's substance" integrate without muddling peak reveals.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of energy beings and time-texture via poet's roadside arc transforms moral dilemma tropes, risk in nonlinear history paying off inevitably at closure.</comment>
