<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina's reverence for wood and perpetual learning drive carving choices with embodied emotion (warm slide, guided blade); micro-choices reveal values, earning reconfiguration, but minimal simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in the pivotal carving beat slightly limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory buildup and visions to CR closure ("turbine-hum...compass now"), with legible cost in foregone rush ("technology would have rushed her past this moment"); single scene, orientation anchored early, one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storm-tossed archway and driftwood constrain pause/carving, sensory hierarchy (turbine-hum, rain drum) filtered through sculptor's bias charges reverie; evolving storm-light mirrors internal flow, integrating purposefully without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reimagining driftwood tightens accumulatively via slide visions narrowing to allied creation; storm isolation and pause cost legible, agency in enduring to carve, but single deepening without micro-turn caps intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Spiral sculpture as wave/wind/woman offers resonant non-literal answer to layered creation, emerging organically from particulars; slide's future projection adds lingering ambiguity without moralizing, reweighting renewal premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (wood "remembers," storm-song); rhythmic texture modulates from tension to reverie flow, diction biased toward natural rhythms; purposeful compression in visions remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels carving reverie; "time folded like origami" purposeful without muddle, minor figurative density in reflections integrated but edges toward overwriting without harming closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Timewoven alliances via self-projected slide synthesize magical realism and artist lineage into fresh threshold premise; carving guidance transforms trope organically, risk of lyric reverie heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
