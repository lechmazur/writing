<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete interiority in ear-to-glass listening and rain-slashed broadcasting reveals contradictory impulses of isolation and allegiance; final smile earns her renunciation of direct involvement with felt cost of indirect service.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as signal density builds to Prophet's words on dead frequency; Charged Poise closure legible in "work nearly complete" with conceptual cost of her midwifery role crystallized amid golden clouds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt portico constrains choice by demanding paradox embrace ("water and electricity"); charges final image as it "sang its dawn song," reweighting her sanctuary as prophetic tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake of midwifing Prophet tightens accumulatively via intensifying storm signals and her responsive broadcast; cost felt in "paradox would kill most people" endurance and isolation payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of harmonics transforming worlds emerges implicitly through frequency motifs shifting from ghosts to "new song"; final image reconfigures variant allegiance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("shadows teaching sunrise new colors") biases toward prophetic frequencies; rhythmic modulation peaks in log entries, stable single POV under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High figurative density risks overwrite in storm beats ("reality's origami creases"), but propulsion holds with varied syntax; no loops dull closure image of unfolding future.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio prophecy and cobalt resonance transforms apocalypse tropes; risk in gritty-lyric voice heightens stakes, inevitable in "harmonics" reconfiguration.</comment>
