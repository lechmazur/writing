<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mariel's motivation to preserve wonder roots clearly in her role and dream-insight, driving precise actions with embodied silence as asset; interiority concrete via "muted vigor" and gloved handling, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during fragment application.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from climb/setup to melting absorption and symphony release; on-page RR closure via bells' transformed song spreading wonder, cost legible in fragment's irreversible melt and her eternal guardianship.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Bell tower's gimbals, chains, and cloud-wreathed base constrain tuning choices and charge final wave-spreading image; sensory details (echoing footsteps, inner light pulse) filter through her priorities, evolving causally with wind-motion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve vanishing wonder) signaled early and deepens via dream to bell-absorption under Accumulative lens; agency in adjustments forecloses melt-option with visible cost in dripping water, charging final global ripple.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's non-verbal eternity emerges organically from ice-to-bell transfer and symphony waves rekindling marvel; final image of silent tending offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting language's obsolescence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in color pulses ("turquoise threads") and motion-biased noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from setup calm to climax shimmer, voice cohering as silent guardian's lyric texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "bronze began to sing—not with sound, but with color"); varied rhythm and purposeful figures avoid loops, propelling to closure image without scaffold or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-language world, color-trapping bells, and ice-memory transforms tropes into inevitable closure; risk in kinetic wonder-broadcast heightens stakes organically.</comment>
