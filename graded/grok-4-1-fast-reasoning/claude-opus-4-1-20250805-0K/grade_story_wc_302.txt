<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Veiled dreamer's interiority shines in embodied sensations like the watch growing warm and pen moving faster, revealing contradictory caution and exuberance under pressure; final realization as keeper earned via prior micro-choices in documentation. Librarian applies targeted pressure without diluting POV. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through pattern observation to CR closure where second letter materializes "in her own hand but from a future she hadn't yet lived," reweighting her role with conceptual cost of eternal documentation. Orientation anchored early via steps, watch, letters; single scene coherent. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glowing library and mist constrain via propagation delays that "followed a mathematical sequence," shaping documentation tactics; final transparency to other libraries charges CR image. Sensory details like humming shelves and amber light filter through POV urgency. Purposeful, no white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find unspoken library tightens accumulatively via delays, librarian insight, and watch alignment, narrowing to realization that forecloses visitor status with cost of becoming keeper. Agency in documenting drives escalation; cost legible in "her notes waiting in the propagation delays." Minor abstractness in early stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken power in pauses emerges organically from delays and cipher, culminating in resonant CR: "some words remain unspoken... because their power lies in the infinite potential of the pause." No moralizing; final veil-lift recharges motifs without literals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing diction like "consciousness folding through time like origami"; rhythm modulates from mist descent to pulsing recognition. Librarian dialogue natural, subtextual. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "mist coiled... like trapped constellations") taught early, varying rhythm accelerates to closure pulse; zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Propulsion clear in every line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystical library trope via propagation delays as "breathing space" and reversing watch revealing cipher; risk in nonlinear time cycles heightens stakes to CR without gimmickry. Inevitable in hindsight from opening watch symbols.</comment>
