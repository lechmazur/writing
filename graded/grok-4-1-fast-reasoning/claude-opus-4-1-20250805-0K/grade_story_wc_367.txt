<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in breathing and laughs; shadowed elation at climax feels earned through ritual evolution. Micro-choices in prophetic murmurs and harmony reveal values under pressure. Minor stock mysticism in mutterings slightly flattens peak contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via ship visions to mirror harmony, yielding Charged Poise closure as wick reverses with conceptual cost of evolved purpose. Orientation anchored early in lighthouse routine. No slips touch final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Wick and emerald lens constrain steering choices and charge final reversal image. Sensory hierarchy (gleaming walls, pulsing wick) filters through Mira's herald priorities. Purposeful selectivity mirrors urgency in ritual deepening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide ships amid dimensional veil) tightens accumulatively to mirror-twin harmony, narrowing options with harmony's risk. Third ship deepens pressure, forcing agency in shared laugh. Cost legible in routine's evolution and shadowed elation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of reality-navigation via laughter emerges organically from ritual particulars, resonating in stars' rearrangement without moralizing. Final image reweights premise: herald teaches universe, not just ships. Counter-reading in inverse twin adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in laugh-calibrated frequencies and prophetic spills. Poetic diction modulates rhythmically with ritual intensity. No head-hopping; compression purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; "laughter" motif propels without looping into artifact. Minor overwrought phrasing in "exhaling possibility" but purposeful for voice. Propulsion clear, no scaffold dulls climax harmony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of physics (total internal reflection) and mysticism in herald's laugh-steering transforms tropes. Mirror-twin turn inevitable from routine pattern. Bold premise commits fully to dimensional navigation.</comment>
