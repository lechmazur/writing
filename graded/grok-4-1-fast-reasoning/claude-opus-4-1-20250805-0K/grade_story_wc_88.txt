<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's guilt-without-memory paradox drives contradictory impulses peaking in his voiced doubt ("Why should they forgive someone who gets to forget?"), earning the final step with embodied cost in scars and temple tenderness. Old woman's traits consistent but secondary. Minor tell in procedure backstory doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: decoding → cave → revelations → step onto bridge as Charged Poise closure, with cost legible in "feeling it solidify under his feet as the organisms...responded to his...intention." Single scene, orientation anchored in first paragraph. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake constrains choices via shifting bridges/paths and charges final image ("silhouette merged with the cave's bioluminescent glow"); selective sensory glow reflects urgency and POV priorities. Spatial choreography clear, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (clean slate via empathy kindling) signaled early, tightens causally through path glimpses narrowing to first beckoning bridge; agency in pocket/step forecloses inaction with felt cost of retained feeling capacity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness-as-giver's gift emerges organically via baseball reprise (future signing reweights past changeability) and final step image answering "Why...forgive?" without statement; resonant non-literal reconfiguration avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (guilt via scars/temple); dialogue natural/subtextual ("Guilt without memory...interesting paradox"), distinct voices, rhythm modulates intensity. No head-hopping or filter stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "lake's glow intensified, revealing...paths"); rhythm varies, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent ("pressed flowers that refuse to crumble"). Minor overwriting in cave desc doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time travel proof (Ruth 2047 sig) with empathy labyrinth transforms tropes; risk in non-linear time/empathy neural paths heightens stakes organically, inevitable in baseball pocket/final merge.</comment>
