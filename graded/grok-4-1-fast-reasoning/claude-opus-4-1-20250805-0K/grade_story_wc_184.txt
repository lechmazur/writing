<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's adaptability shines in practiced reconfigurations, revealing character through micro-choices under time pressure; interiority concrete via tactile sensations like the "warm" seal. Minimal internal contradiction limits peak tension, but endurance of liminal risk earns change with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as braid configurations layer revelations, culminating in CR closure: "absences were simply presences waiting to be properly understood," with cost in flickering door and risked entrapment. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mechanism room's gears and thirteenth chime constrain weaving pace, charging final image; sensory details (clicking gears, shimmering braids) filtered through archivist bias. Micro-setting as tool/recurring object elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unveiling treaty escalates via deepening configurations under Accum lens, narrowing to paradox embrace; agency in final seal press forecloses tidy resolution with chime pressure cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of paradoxical absences emerges organically from fables and merged lands, resonant CR in final image reweighting premise without moral; subtext in negative space map lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with archivist perceptual signature (pattern-noticing in braids/shadows); rhythmic diction modulates to charged poise at "doorway just as it ceased to exist."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel revelations; purposeful figurative layering (pulsing seal, shimmering map) coherent without muddle in peak weave.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rope as multi-truth archive transforms forgotten-history trope into paradox embrace; risk in liminal closure inevitable from particulars.</comment>
