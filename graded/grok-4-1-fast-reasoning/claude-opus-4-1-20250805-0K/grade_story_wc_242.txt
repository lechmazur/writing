<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to cultivate estrangement feels rooted and intensifies through micro-choices like pressing the disc to the receiver; interior conflict emerges in his isolation acknowledged at "these orphaned conversations his only human contact." Eleanor's voice develops distinct haunted idiom without stereotypes. Minor reflection summaries slightly abstract embodiment pre-closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from descent to Eleanor's confession; closure as Charged Poise in final image of waiting with disc singing reconfigures estrangement, cost legible in "the tunnel was his world now." Orientation anchored early at ladder descent; one tightening via Eleanor's dream-to-admission beat suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tunnel setting constrains via sparse light and acoustics shaping voice alterations; disc as micro-setting charges final play with "spiraled through the empty phone booths." Sensory hierarchy (third rail frequency, train rumbles) reflects Marcus's perceptual bias. No white-room; evolves with passing trains.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of productive disconnection accumulates pressure through repeated calls, tightening at Eleanor's "I think I made her up entirely" forcing Marcus's reaffirming phrase. Agency in endurance forecloses normal connection with isolation cost felt on-page. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens but lacks sharper option-narrowing trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of estrangement yielding self-discovery emerges organically from wrong-number calls and disc motifs, resonant in final "practice the art of being beautifully, necessarily lost" reweighting without moralizing. Subtext in silences like Eleanor's pause layers complexity. Final image answers premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in melodic perceptions like "frequencies only the disconnected could hear." Dialogue subtext-driven, Eleanor's haunted rhythm distinct from Marcus's modulated responses. Minor elevated diction drifts in reflective phrases but rhythm controls pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like disc "catching the sparse fluorescent light" advancing setting/action; rhythm varies for propulsion. Purposeful repetition of "hum" and "melody" taught as pattern pays off at closure. Minor paraphrase loops in call descriptions ("always did") dull mid-section slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of liminal phone therapy transforms disconnection trope via disc frequencies and tunnel acoustics into fresh CR at ending. Risky lyric accumulation heightens isolation stakes organically. No derivative echoes; synthesis of obsolete tech and estrangement feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
