<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via concrete texture perceptions (e.g., poison label's "complex weave") and micro-choices like pencil annotations reveal contradictory impulses toward dissolution and testimony, earning the signing closure with visible cost of naming ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from maze navigation to layered annotations culminating in CR closure at fresh ink signature, where cost of "true and false" identity reconfigures options; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Containers and tides constrain choices (echo navigation, high-tide visits) and charge final image of "metal voices harmonizing"; sensory bias (sounds over sights) mirrors POV priorities without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of affirming erased existence escalates via pattern break at new annotation, forcing signing agency with felt cost in pocket label's weave; one deepening sufficient under textural lens, though external pressure overheard only.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Erased histories theme emerges organically from annotations' layers, answered non-literally by "congregation" realization reweighting premise without moralizing; final rust-steel image resonates with prior textures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in texture/filter diction (e.g., "fabric unraveling"); rhythmic modulation heightens quiet pressure, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels accumulative beats; minor figurative density (watercolors, weave) consistent and taught, but occasional paraphrase near container descriptions slightly dulls mid-section momentum without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic ghosts and annotation layers transforms erasure trope, with container congregation inevitable from early patterns; risk of lyric textural drive heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
