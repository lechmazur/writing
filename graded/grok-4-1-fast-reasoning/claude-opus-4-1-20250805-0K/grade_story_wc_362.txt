<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in palm on pillar and trembling hands reveals mystic determination under isolation pressure; revelation earned via prior observations. Minor weakness: internal conflict more summarized in backstory than simultaneous impulses in pivotal commune beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through prism response to frost CR; orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure reconfigures mind-matter boundary with time cost as mist lifts, forcing photos—"Frost couldn't survive the coming warmth."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist and arbor constrain timing of prism angle and documentation; frost evolution charges final image. Sensory filter via Vera's mystic lens (humming pillars, emotional wavelengths) integrates purposefully without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proof via prism) tightens via unexpected frost map revealing personal emotions, narrowing to quick capture. Agency in angling prism drives escalation under Accumulative lens; felt cost in fleeting patterns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of emotion-preserved-in-matter emerges organically via frost lexicon; final prism-clutch reweights "truthful lies" without moralizing. Resonance in triumph absorption echoes prior family layers, charging CR.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with mystic perceptual signature ("emotional wavelengths visible only to those who knew"); rhythmic modulation peaks in revelation. No head-hopping, diction biased to Vera's grounded mysticism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("frost spreading in patterns that matched"); rhythm varies for emotional beats. Minor paraphrase loop in "patterns" repetition purposeful for theme, no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Frost-as-emotion-map innovates mystic-science premise organically; family prism synthesis feels inevitable. Risk in CR via ice lexicon transforms tropes without gimmickry.</comment>
