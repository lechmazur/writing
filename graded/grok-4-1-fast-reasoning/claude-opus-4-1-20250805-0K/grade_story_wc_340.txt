<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in patient curiosity intensifies through decoding micro-choices; embodied emotions like misted breath and quickened pulse feel particular. Final endurance of routine transformed by claimed legacy shows earned change with felt cost of isolation. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in decode beat, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via floor-by-floor density build to CR closure: final realization reweights ascent as pursuit of joy with undeniable conceptual cost in "encrypt her own." Orientation anchored early in Mira/elevator/spire; pattern taught immediately, one tightening via projected coordinates. Cost legible in "clouds that no longer seemed quite so cold."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Icebound spire and elevator constrain choices (shuddering cables heighten urgency, warmth vs. frost enables ink reveal) and charge final image (goggles' warmth vs. cold). Sensory details selective/POV-biased (frost as grief, wind howling); setting evolves causally with altitude. Micro-setting (goggles as tool) integrates perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover joy beneath sorrow) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via hidden ink revelation narrowing interpretive options. Agency in tilting goggles and decoding forces stance crystallization; cost felt in reconfigured purpose ("ascending toward... encrypt her own"). One meaningful cadence shift suffices, charges Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of "sorrow shared becomes joy" emerges organically from particulars (margin notes, pressed joys); final image offers non-literal resonant answer via goggles' reprise reweighting isolation. Avoids moralizing, embraces ambiguity in Thorne's "departure." Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (tenderness in technical details, frost as lace); rhythmic modulation builds tension in short ascent sentences. Prose texture distinct in syntax variety; no head-hopping or withholding. Perceptual bias consistent under rising revelation pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "gears clicked like a grandfather clock counting backwards" advances time/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful/patterned (ice motifs), coherent without muddle. Minor density in metaphors during peak reveal prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of discovery trope via floor-climb accumulation and light-projection decode; transforms abandoned-spire cliché through encrypted tenderness. Risky structure heightens stakes organically; final reconfiguration feels inevitable from shorthand motif. Minor proximity to hidden-treasure archetype tempers score.</comment>
