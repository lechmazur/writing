<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Merrick's motivation intensifies credibly from routine to deep incision with the child's request, embodied in contradictory caution ("sharp incisors") yielding to action; child's photo-grounded want reveals hierarchy of values. Final endurance/renunciation earned via prior micro-choices under weave of endings' risk. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like quantifying voids drive competent struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (droplets, voids) builds to CR closure where shelves transform into perpetual beginnings, reweighting premise with conceptual cost legible in "stories that would never have to end." Orientation anchored early (shop in floating library). One tightening via library's tremble suffices; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass roots drawing dream-wisps and crystalline leaves constrain choices (tools accessed amid tinkling), selectively sensory via fractured light; evolves causally (apples fill with light) to charge final image mirroring internal shift. Recurrent jars/vials as micro-setting guide perception and payoff. POV bias perfect in quantifying gaps between droplets.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (erase endings) signaled early, texturally escalates via "woven through everything" warning narrowing options; child's endurance and Merrick's agency foreclose pain/path with felt cost in library tremble and self-alteration. One decisive deepening via moonlight-guided incision. Coheres under Accumulative lens to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of perpetual beginnings emerges implicitly from particulars (grandfather's open mouth, dissolving endings), reweighted non-literally in shelf transformation without moralizing. Subtext in silences ("She stopped") and image shifts invites ambiguity. Final line recharges premise with conceptual cost of "never quite arriving."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with perceptual signature (quantifying voids/absence); diction/rhythm modulates elegantly from serene ("tinkled overhead") to charged ("trembled"). Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (child's "maybe they never have to"); no head-hopping, elisions purposeful/legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density (multi-job lines like "quantifying absence by the spaces"), varied rhythm/read-aloud flow; metaphors coherent (parole-glow architecture). Zero loops/artifacts; propulsion peaks in incision beat without overwriting. Final image recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-trade in floating glass orchard transforms tropes via parole/mindful scattering; risk in eternal non-arrival heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious turns (library as story reacting) inevitable from premise; no derivatives.</comment>
