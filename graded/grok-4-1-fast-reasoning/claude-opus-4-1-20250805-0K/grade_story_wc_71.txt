<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority shines in concrete perceptions like cataloguing the gnome's subtle head turns, rooting motivation in her trait as noticer; final offering choice earned by building realization of houses' grief-transformation, with embodied warmth of shard as felt cost. Contradictory noticing of "small wrongnesses" others dismiss drives inevitable witnessing without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of displaced objects builds density to shard-reveal tightening knowledge, landing CR closure in shard placement on sand as offering with conceptual cost of joining the sanctification cycle. Orientation anchored early in neighborhood walks; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bay's "held breath" hush and streetlights' liminal flicker constrain revelation moment, charging final image of cradled treasures; sensory violet warmth and whispering waves filter through Marina's perceptual bias, mirroring internal quiet blaze without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to understand alive houses escalates via object-tracing to shard-deepening that narrows to realization; agency in holding shard and offering forecloses passive observation with cost of personal sacrifice felt in palms' warmth and tomorrow's displacement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief-love sanctifying places emerges organically from displaced offerings tied to specific losses (Hendersons' daughter); final image of bay cradling prayers reweights premise without moral, embracing ambiguity of houses holding absence/presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in subtle shifts (mailbox migrating); lyrical rhythm modulates from cataloguing beats to charged closure, diction like "crystallized hush" purposeful and biased to her noticing mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with lines like "hush so complete it blazed" doing triple duty (sensory, thematic, propulsion); varied syntax breathes with revelation build, zero loops/artifacts, read-aloud rhythm peaks in "walls learned to embrace."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh magical realist synthesis of noticing bias + living houses + hush-shard transforms creeping normality into sacred grief-metamorphosis; risk in quiet CR closure pays off inevitably from particulars, no template echoes.</comment>
