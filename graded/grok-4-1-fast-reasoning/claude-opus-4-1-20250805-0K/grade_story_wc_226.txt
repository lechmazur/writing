<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in childhood pebble experiments intensifies to chamber speech, with embodied chill and breath revealing defiance under pressure; earned closure smile forecloses silencing path. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps at strong but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of whispers-to-chorus builds to CR closure in "spire seemed to pulse with new purpose," reweighting towers from prison to transmitter with conceptual cost to Silencers' control legible in approaching boots.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Canyon echoes and bone handholds constrain climbs and poetry spread, charging final spire pulse; sensory hierarchy (mist chill, voice harmonies) filters through Kira's acoustic bias without generic catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shatter truth monopoly) signaled early tightens via voice accumulation under Accumulative lens, narrowing to chamber occupation; cost visible in ritual transformation and unforgiven defiance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as complexity emerges organically from refracting poems, culminating in non-literal CR "truth, like light through water, would always find a way to bend" that reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with sound-biased perceptual signature; lyrical diction modulates rhythmically from whisper to chorus without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety propels via short whispers building to longer echoes; minor "voices" accumulation purposeful under lens, no loops obscuring closure image of pulsing spire.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh acoustic refraction premise transforms bone towers into truth multipliers, with risk-taking in echo physics heightening stakes organically to inevitable CR hindsight.</comment>
