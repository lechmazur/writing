<comment>Elara's interiority shines in embodied details like numb fingers fumbling the ancient slide, revealing contradictory impulses to save selectively amid loss. Micro-choices in measuring frequencies compel her final vow, earning closure with visible cost. No unearned epiphanies; traits drive inevitable struggle against collapse.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: methodical sampling builds to discovery of founder's slide, reconfiguring preservation as transcendent. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coheres. Closure as CR in "I promise to begin again" with cost of plummeting library legible on-page.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Vault's failing cold constrains choices, flickering edges narrowing options; frost patterns and quartz hush charge final "ice became rain." Sensory hierarchy (cracking ice under feet, humming slides) reflects Elara's meticulous priorities. No white-room; spatial choreography tracks slide selection cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (save brightest vows) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density: moderate readings yield to child's 9.7 and immeasurable founder's blaze, forcing trade-offs. Discovery tightens pressure, her vow crystallizing stance with felt cost of total loss. Coherent under lens; one deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of transcending oblivion emerges organically from vow projections, culminating in founder's "remember them all" reweighting Elara's selective preservation. Final image of falling library seeding renewal answers without stating moral. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes; ambiguity in what survives lingers meaningfully.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature: Elara notices luminosity frequencies and frost crystals bias toward archival precision. Rhythmic prose modulates from hush to "light exploded," heightening pressure. No head-hopping; diction controlled, voice-poetic yet grounded in her idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density in "silver calipers... prism that split promise-light" advances action and specificity. Rhythm varies (short "Ice cracking" punches urgency); no overwriting, metaphors cohere (warmth as "blood from stone"). Propulsion peaks clean at projection explosion.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: dying vows as measurable light in collapsing sky-library transforms memory tropes via Elara's metrics. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from founder's slide reveal. Bold conceptual commitment without retreat; no template echoes.</comment>
