<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority shines in recognizing his own suffering mapped onto the puppet's cracks, driving a credible shift from mechanical adjustment to melodic inheritance. Contradictory impulses—rational clockwork vs. emotional song—act simultaneously when he touches the cheek and feels the flood. Final endurance of the burden feels earned with embodied cost in his untrained, cracking voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as revelations via puppet densify toward RR closure: clock hands moving backward reconfigures inevitability with conceptual cost of eternal tenderness. Orientation anchors early (Marcus, lighthouse edge). No shards; single scene tightens meaningfully without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lighthouse lens and stairs constrain climax climb and puppet placement, charging final image. Sensory hush, bruised plum dusk filter through Marcus's pattern-seeing bias. Evolving environment (inert beam to ignited patterns) mirrors internal shift without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (delaying doomsday) deepens accumulatively via puppet memories and vouchsafed burden, narrowing to song-agency that forecloses mechanical path. Cost legible in "weight...shift inside him" and flawed voice. Escalation coherent under lens, protagonist-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme of flawed tenderness emerges organically from kintsugi-like cracks to backward clock, reweighting endings as cradled rather than feared. Final image—tears in puppet eyes, nested light—resonates non-literally without moralizing. Particulars like lullaby avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with poetic perceptual signature: patterns/prisms bias noticing. Voice modulates rhythmically from hush to singing crescendo. No dialogue; elisions (memories) taught early, paid in transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric rhythm, varying sentences; "nested patterns" repetition taught as motif without loops. Minor metaphor density ("ripples in reverse," "light through prism") in buildup risks slight overwrite but serves voice without muddling closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms doomsday trope via song-wound time and puppet inheritance, risking lyric boldness. Puppet-lullaby turn inevitable from nested trauma particulars. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
