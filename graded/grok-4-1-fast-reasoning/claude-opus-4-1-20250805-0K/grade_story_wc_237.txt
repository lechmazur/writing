<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously as scholarship empties and superstition resurfaces under stress, compelling the rune from her scars; final transformation earned via held breath's cost, shedding shame without tidy rationalization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as crystal density and memory fragments build to CR closure: rune pulses with permanence after shedding dust, cost legible in "lungs screamed" and platform tilt; orientation anchored in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystalline skin as micro-setting constrains choice (traced for rune) and charges final image (glittering dust); floating platform sways tactilely under stress, sensory hush broken purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (original rune) tightens via crystal escalation (one to four), narrowing to breath-held agency; cost unmistakable in physical scream and emotional shedding, reweighting condition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of affliction-as-language emerges organically from crystal-counting and rune-autobiography; final shedding dust offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting scars without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable Kira-limited POV with perceptual bias toward crystals (frost, stars); rhythmic modulation peaks in "quill moved as if guided," dialogue sparse but subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and integrated imagery ("ink flowed like liquid starlight"); no loops, metaphors cohere without muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stress-crystals as rune-source transforms fantasy tropes via superstition reinterpretation ("boi" as vessel); inevitable hindsight from early skin prickling.</comment>
