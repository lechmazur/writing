<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vera's gift constraining her hands and ink flow embodies her motivation vividly, earning her final commitment to transcribe with felt loneliness as cost. Contradictory isolation versus truth-duty acts in her steady piecing despite exhaustion. Minor slip: loneliness slightly told rather than fully micro-chosen under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as discoveries layer density to CR closure: transcribing all messages reweights filtered truths with city's peace-dissolve cost, legible in "even if it meant watching the greenhouse city's carefully maintained peace dissolve." Orientation anchored early in workshop; shards transition legibly via map-following.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Toxic sky, domes, and tunnel's "sweating condensation that smelled of copper and regret" constrain choices (mask, narrow access) and charge closure image of "breathing leaves and bitter honesty." Sensory hierarchy via calligrapher's tactile tracing filters urgently. No white-room; micro-objects like brush integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lost truths) deepens accumulatively through piecing and crystals, narrowing to deliver-all choice with agency-driven cost in peace dissolution. One tightening suffices: grandmother's letter forces thematic repricing. No abstract stakes; visceral crystallization tests commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-water emerges organically from crystallized messages and final "truths were worth wilting for," reweighting premise via CR without moralizing. Subtext in intercepted candor charges closure image. Complexity lingers in lie-diverted water versus collective peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with calligrapher's perceptual signature (gold-tipped brush tracing, ink flow) biases noticing concretely. Prose texture modulates rhythm to pressure: short sentences in tunnel build urgency. No elision or head-hopping; diction fits lived-in greenhouse idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines; rhythm varies (e.g., tunnel's synesthetic "copper and regret"). Zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak crystal discovery. Strategic telling compresses piecing night efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis: lie-sensing calligrapher + sound-crystallizing tubes transforms postal tropes into fresh conceptual stakes. Risky crystallized-honesty premise commits fully, heightening closure's social cost without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; world logic inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
