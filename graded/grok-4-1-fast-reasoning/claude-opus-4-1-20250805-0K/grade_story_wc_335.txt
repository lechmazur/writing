<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—nervous backward walking versus forward teaching—act in scene, earning Kess's transformation with relational cost; traits shown through micro-choices like hand on shoulder. Past betrayal anchors present without flattening pressure. Final choice to annotate together forecloses despair path visibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: revelations (shadow, leaves, ledger) densify to Charged Poise closure where shadow settles post-annotation, reweighting exile with conceptual cost of remembrance. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Single scene, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Recurring glass and cup constrain choices (tilting, tapping) and charge final settling image; sensory hierarchy (clicks, dust, hush) reflects archivist priorities. Library shards evolve via shadow pulse. Subtle mirroring of internal states via playground swing bookend.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mother's reversal) signaled early, tightens via leaf spiral break forcing stance shift to annotation; Accumulative deepening reweights with emotional cost in Kess's crumbling anger. Agency in shared work forecloses inaction. No coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reversible exile via signs emerges from particulars (shadow writhe to settle); final "every exile is reversible, if someone remembers" reconfigures premise non-literally with remembrance cost. Subtext in combative exchanges avoids morals. Earned via conflict, not statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited perceptual signature (geometry/maps noticing) biases details; dialogue subtextual ("hope is always a weapon") pursues goals, distinct rhythms/idioms per character. Rhythmic control modulates from snap to quiet annotation. No head-hopping, elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short snaps to flowing descriptions); no loops, metaphors coherent ("rust on iron" laugh fits texture). Propulsion aligns with pressure, closure image crisp. Zero scaffold in peak annotation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirror shards/tea geometry transforms exile trope into mathematical love; risk in patterned elision (omens/maps) heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from shadow pulse to settle. Non-obvious moral calculus via betrayal/resilience.</comment>
