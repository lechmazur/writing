<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ezra's precognitive amnesia creates contradictory impulses acting in scene—writing prophecies he forgets then recognizes—forcing micro-choices like guiding the woman, earning final endurance with chalk's erosion as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fog visions, prophecies, and static layers builds to CR closure in "Tomorrow you will remember," reweighting forgetting as kindness with perpetual cycle cost legible in final chalk image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fog sculptures and TV wall constrain navigation and search, charging final image where "fog sculptures reached toward them like solid dreams"; sensory details (salt-weathered wood, ocean rhythm) mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locating age's frequency) signaled early, tightens accumulatively when woman's arrival braids her grandmother's echoes into Ezra's search, forcing collaborative tuning with her tears and his ongoing amnesia as felt costs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory's degrade/preserve emerges organically from particulars like deteriorating tapes and dissolving fog, reweighted non-literally in closure realization: "His forgetting was not a curse but a kindness."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with perceptual signature (visions in fog he forgets) and rhythmic prose modulate intensity; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual, distinguishing characters via her directness vs. his prophetic sorrow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion—e.g., "chalk scraped against salt-weathered wood"—varies rhythm without loops; figurative language purposeful (fog as "memories he couldn't quite hold"), coherent in peak tuning beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of precognitive amnesia, fog sculptures, and static frequency transforms tropes; risk in cyclical structure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via chalk's wearing as time's echo.</comment>
