<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong concrete interiority and motivation rooted in molting as method, shown via rebuilding pages; contradictory impulses subtle in embracing illegibility over permanence. Minor slip: no simultaneous internal conflict acting on-page, but endurance earned via prior causality in tin touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of backstory shards tightening to Charged Poise/CR closure; orientation anchored early in rusted library. Final tin touch reconfigures resistance with illegibility cost legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: moonlight as "liquid silver" pours through absent roof, constraining page work and charging final tin image. Recurring tin/object constrains by hiding names, mirroring internal anarchy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forge resistance anthology vs. uniformity) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via backstory density to reweight with molting cost; agency in persistent rebuilding forecloses legibility path. One tightening via Marcus cue suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of beauty from brokenness emerges organically via rebuilt pages mirroring resistance; final "revolution grew one name at a time" offers non-literal resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with poetic perceptual signature ("molted personalities monthly like a snake sheds skin"); rhythmic diction modulates from calm reflection to charged poise, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful lyrical metaphors ("luminous fractures"); minor paraphrase in page descriptions but no loops touching closure; propulsion clear to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of molting poet rebuilding resistance anthology transforms vagrancy tropes; risk in monthly personalities heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via tin closure.</comment>
