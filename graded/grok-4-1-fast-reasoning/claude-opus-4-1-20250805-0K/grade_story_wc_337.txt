<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong interiority via "lucid unrest" and hands that "remember what minds forgot," revealing contradictory wake-dream state; final endurance of inheritance as restorer earns closure with ongoing cost. No safety-hedging; flaws like scarred hands and whisper-guidance complicate craft authentically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: knot-unraveling builds fragment density to prism hum and spirit settlement as RR with conceptual cost in masks' transformation. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene tightens meaningfully without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prisms refracting moonlight and humming constrain ritual, charging final sunlight strike and spirit fade; selective sensory hierarchy (thunder-fog sound, silver-glow hemp) mirrors POV urgency. Evolving details integrate via action, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ground spirits via restoration) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through visions and hum to foreclose unrest; agency in needle-dance yields visible cost of net's full unraveling and perpetual duty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of mending absence/presence emerges via hemp-from-binding-to-mending; final "crystalline embrace" reconfigures inheritance non-literally, lingering ambiguity in ongoing work without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in hush-weaving diction modulates rhythmically; compression taught early (knot-thunder) pays off in starlight-jellyfish image without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "ribbons of color that danced" varies rhythm, no loops; figurative consistency (serpent-net, sediment-spirits) coherent, zero scaffold in peak restoration beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-craft trope via net-mask logic and silence-accumulation; fresh synthesis inevitable in hemp-sealing cracks, risk-taking in hush-timefold heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
