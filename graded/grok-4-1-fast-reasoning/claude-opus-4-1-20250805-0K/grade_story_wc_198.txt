<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation rooted in grandfather's legacy compels non-playing with embodied tension in "fingers danced above the keys without touching"; collective endurance forecloses prophecy's futures with felt cost in final linger, though secondary musicians lack distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with silence density tightening from solo almost-playing to collective barrier; on-page RR closure in "prophecy still existed...but now it slept" with conceptual cost of recurring burden legible in dewdrops falling away syllables.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism atrium constrains sound rules and charges final rainbow image; bioluminescent moss pulses with unplayed rhythm, mirroring internal states through selective sensory narrowing under hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to hush prophecy signaled early escalates via collective density under Accumulative lens, narrowing to renunciation of played music; cost unmistakable in "futures that would never be" and burden's partial lift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence smothering words emerges organically from negative space acts; final dewdrop prisms offer non-literal resonant answer reweighting prophecy's inevitability without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with musical perceptual signature in "shadow-song"; whisper dialogue natural and goal-driven, advancing collective turn without subtext overload.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythmic prose varies with scene hush, high density in integrated metaphors like "silence...dense as lead"; minor paraphrase loop in prophecy scattering/reforming slightly dulls mid-beat momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of jazz negative space hushing coded prophecy feels inevitable; risk in silence-as-weapon heightens stakes, transforming trope of musical magic organically.</comment>
