<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied recognition—"fingers remembered wrapping it"—reveals contradictory precision vs. memory impulses acting in scene; final phone call choice earned by prior shame and loss with visible cost of integrating past.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from cataloging to personal recognition tightening knowledge; CR closure in phone call and cloth wrapping reconfigures failure into purpose with undeniable emotional cost felt in "earned his expertise through loss."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quarry trailer and pit constrain isolation for reflection while charging final image—"held his words like an acoustic chamber"—with sensory hierarchy (hum in B-flat, wind creak) filtered through musician's acoustic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of appraising provenance amid shame signaled early, tightens via cloth recognition reversal narrowing escape option; agency in affirming "genuine" by feel forecloses denial with legible cost of past loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of translating loss into purpose emerges organically from cloth particulars, resonant non-literal answer in final wrapping image reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in acoustic metaphors (e.g., "fibers compressed by actual music"); rhythmic control heightens recognition pressure, phone dialogue natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and coherent metaphors (quarry as amphitheater); no loops or scaffolds, propulsion peaks in "really see the cloth" without overwriting in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie past and appraiser present via tactile cloth memory transforms redemption trope; risk in lyric reflection heightens stakes organically.</comment>
