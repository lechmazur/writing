<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation roots in pattern-noticing trait and intensifies to guardian role via earned realization; interiority concrete in recognizing inverted rune from early lessons. Micro-choices like precise key insertion reveal values under pressure. No strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from key insertion to reversed automaton revealing coordinates, culminating in CR closure: loops close with "whisper that sounded almost like relief," felt conceptual cost of enforced ignorance legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating isle and observatory gears/crystal lenses constrain choices, charging final rune-tracing; shadows fleeing upward through lenses mirror internal sealing, with selective sensory focus on brass whirring and trembling isle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trace shadows to prevent awakening) signaled early, escalates via automaton reversal narrowing options to inverted sealing rune; noon pressure forces stance crystallization in rune-tracing agency, cost felt in "fragile peace of ignorance."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of containing forbidden knowledge emerges organically from spoon shadows and inverted runes, resonant non-literal answer in final inheritance image reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward rune patterns and reversed writing; rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate calm to urgent noon trembling without head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with lines doubling action/atmosphere (e.g., "brass gears meshed with crystal lenses"); varied rhythm propels to closure, minor "quietly deliberate" repetition purposeful but borders loop without obscuring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Spoon Convergence and noon-upward shadows transform reality-bending tropes into fresh sealing prison logic; risk-taking in reversed automaton payoff feels inevitable from mentor's note.</comment>
