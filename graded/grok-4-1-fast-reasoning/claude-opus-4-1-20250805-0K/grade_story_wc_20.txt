<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vera's embodied scars and alchemical past compel her mentorship micro-choices, earning Mira's transformation; contradictory impulses surface in Mira's hesitant clutch of the coin before surrender.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery density (rain patterns, gold seams) builds to Charged Poise closure in coin's reformation and dawn image, with conceptual cost of accepting cracks legible in "beauty in the breaking."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rain-slick floor and dormant furnace constrain ritual choice and mirror internal cracks, charging the final footprints constellation; selective sensory filter (dripping mercury drops) via Vera's alchemical bias elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weighing name's burden) signaled early via coin tightens through reveal and vial pour, forcing Mira's acceptance with felt cost in coin's split; agency in Vera's guidance coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kintsugi-alchemy theme emerges organically from coin ritual and foundry scars, resonating in final image without overt moralizing; Mira's "beauty in the breaking" line earns minor echo penalty as integrated realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-close POV with alchemical perceptual signature (vials glowing amber, coin warming) modulates rhythm under ritual pressure; dialogue carries subtext in whispers and corrections, distinct by character idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors (liquid mercury drops) integrated into action; no loops or scaffolds, rhythm breathes with scene urgency in coin-split beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of soul-transmutation fallout with kintsugi on identity transforms tropes via coin's literal weighing; risk in mystical realism heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
