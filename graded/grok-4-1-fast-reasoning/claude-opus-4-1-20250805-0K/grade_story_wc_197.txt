<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira's gift for puddle-maps and resourcefulness drive consistent motivation with embodied actions like tracing the key and translating the star-map; internal drive to fight indifference earns her emergence. Minor label-speak ("carefully resourceful") slightly abstracts traits without full embodied friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: ripple reveals map → key unlocks tunnel → evidence found → upload amid raid; on-page Charged Poise closure in final key-to-sun image reconfigures rebellion with leaders' arrest as distraction cost. Orientation anchors early at lagoon; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Auric lagoon constrains via dusk reflections for map and bookends with silver shift charging closure; tunnels' fluorescents reveal artifacts tactilely. Sensory details (verdigris plaque, worn key teeth) filter through Mira's historical bias, mirroring indifference theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emerge with unerasable proof) signaled early, tightens causally via raid intel narrowing to tunnel risk; agency in key-use forecloses invisibility path with leaders' arrest cost felt on-page. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of recovered truths vs. indifference emerges via key/docs/puddles without statement; final key/sun image offers non-literal CR repricing "spaces between official stories" with conceptual cost of sustained rebellion. Particulars like booths' erasure ground resonance organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in light-reflections; voice modulates poetically yet grounded (e.g., "ghost-map burned into Mira's memory"). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual (Jakob's "Reappear?" prompts explanation advancing stakes); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid, integrated images (e.g., "auric lagoon... mirror of possibilities"); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors slightly slows but doesn't touch closure; strong verbs anchor action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puddle-divination gift and phone-booth archaeology transforms dystopian trope; risk in "puddle-maps" as rebellion method feels inevitable from Mira's underestimated trait. No derivative echoes; conceptual integrity commits to coded freedom premise.</comment>
