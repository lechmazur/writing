<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through discoveries, but interiority abstract without embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene; realization of purpose feels smooth, lacking struggle or micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-building revelations tightening to CR closure; cost legible in "its last grains falling with the weight of centuries," reconfiguring time as possibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "amber-colored glass that caught and held light like frozen honey" integrate purposefully; walls pulsing with light and floor for spiral constrain assembly and charge climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preservation deepens accumulatively via echo resonance and button arrangement narrowing to prophecy assembly; agency drives tightening with emptying hourglass as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of prophecy as "infinite garden" emerges organically from particulars without statement; final image of golden sand and opened echo offers resonant, non-literal reweighting of endings as beginnings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct lyrical perceptual signature, e.g., truths "unscrambl[ing] themselves from the chaos"; rhythmic modulation suits accumulative intensity without slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel smoothly; purposeful metaphors like "pulverized dreams" avoid muddle, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of buttons as "markers... where someone's timeline had frayed" and echo enabling resonance transforms prophecy tropes into organic conceptual ingenuity.</comment>
