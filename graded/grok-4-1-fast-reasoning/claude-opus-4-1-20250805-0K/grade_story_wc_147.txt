<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's internal conflict between scientific duty and transcendent pull acts simultaneously in scene, embodied via vial breaths triggering surface memories against temple visions; final choice to inhale water earned by prior overrides, with felt cost of daughter's laughter. Contradictory impulses peak in sanctum seeing James serene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of visions, whispers, and paradoxes builds to Conceptual Repricing closure as she becomes the ephemeral, cost legible in "exhaled her last breath of the compound and inhaled the temple's water." One tightening via sanctum discovery narrows flee/join options; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Temple's spatial paradoxes and bioluminescent chamber constrain choices, charging final image of pure light machine; sensory hierarchy (breathing walls, drifting threads) filtered through Maya's cartographer bias. Water architecture mirrors internal unsnarling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve self vs. eternity) signaled via vial, tightens accumulatively as compound dwindles, forcing agency in "swam not up but deeper" with irreplaceable oxygen cost on-page. Pressure coheres under lens to Charged Poise at inhalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of harnessing ephemeral emerges organically via vial visions shifting to temple's preservation logic; final image reconfigures premise non-literally as signal broadcasts her infinity, resonant without moralizing. No tidy binary, embraces sacrificial complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature: scientific precision ("mathematics of impossibility") blends into perceptual drift under stress; rhythmic modulation accelerates in closing breaths. Prose texture distinct, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer action, image, realization without loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies, peaking crisply in "released the empty vial, watching it drift upward like a prayer." Zero artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Lovecraftian temple with scientific transcendence via consciousness-preservation machine; risk in paradoxical geometry pays off in CR closure, transforming tropes through Maya's override arc. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
