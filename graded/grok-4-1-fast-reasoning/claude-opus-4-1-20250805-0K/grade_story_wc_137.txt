<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sympathetic skeptic's contradictory impulses act on-page (murmurs "coincidence" while hands transcribe tile patterns); final integration earned via prior micro-choices like placing the tile despite rationality. Blind spots (incomplete skepticism) drive compounding struggle. Embodied emotion in palm on vibrating wall and warming tile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density (whales, tile symbols, notations) builds to CR closure ("realizing she had spent years trying to separate... integrating it") with conceptual cost of foreclosing pure empiricism. Orientation anchored early (tower, whales at dawn). One tightening via transcription linking oceanic/cosmic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tower and tile constrain choices (tile centered at workspace, held on platform); final image charged by tile's "true pattern" mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy via Elena's math lens (vibrations as progression). Atmosphere tensions skepticism/mystery without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (skepticism vs. legacy/mystery) signaled early, deepens via tile/transcription under accumulative lens, narrowing to integration with felt cost in "doubting their doubts." Agency in climbing/transcribing forecloses separation path. Coherent pressure to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of interconnection/sculpting absence emerges organically from tile patterns, whale songs, grandmother's marginalia; final transcription of "space between certainty and wonder" resonantly reweights premise without moralizing. Particulars (shifting symbols) avoid platitudes; lingering ambiguity in "unheard symphony."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (math proofs on stars/whales) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from wavering murmurs to smiling realization. Purposeful compression of three days taught early, legible at CR closure. Diction fits empirical mystic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short declarative peaks like "She should have discarded it"); no loops or scaffolds. Selective figures (e.g., "sheet music for an orchestra that didn't exist") purposeful, not overwriting in closure. Propulsion weaves reflection into action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of whales/stars/tile as math-mystic lens transforms skeptic trope; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes. Non-obvious entanglement of cosmic/oceanic/memories feels inevitable in hindsight via tile's shifting proofs.</comment>
