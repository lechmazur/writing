<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>David's transformation from skeptic to "participatory wonder" earns closure shift through affectionate pressure; Maya's somatic markers embodied effectively until diagnostic label-speak ("compass, more reliable than logic") slightly abstracts mid-scene tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to light coalescence; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly in "mapping the territories...permanent what chemistry had only glimpsed," with post-shock cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Muscovite sliver handled early and reprises to charge closure ("creating new passages"); studio projectors constrain choices like angle adjustments, filtering through Maya's priorities without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminating pathways vs. skepticism/recall) tightens accumulatively when powder forms "dendrites," narrowing David's doubt; agency in her intuitive flow forecloses isolation path with relational cost felt in goosebumps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of inherent connection emerges organically via demo turning "empathy...tangible"; final image reconfigures premise without moralizing, though "willowglass hope" borders overt symbol.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias (invisible threads); dialogue natural/subtextual ("insane" vs. proof demand), voice distinct in poetic rhythm matching artist's mind, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., powder drift advances plot/atmosphere); figurative density ("fractally precise") taught early without muddle, but minor paraphrase in somatic cues ("tingling here...warmth there") drags propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geode/light painting reveals "pathways already there," transforming telepathy trope via somatic post-shock logic; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in charged final image without gimmickry.</comment>
