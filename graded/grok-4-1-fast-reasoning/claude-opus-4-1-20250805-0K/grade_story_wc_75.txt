<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory dread and fierce tenderness embodied in frantic tracing and lens-pressing, earning final renunciation of total loss; micro-choices reveal archival values under pressure; interiority particular without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (rosewater, drops, crash) tightens to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "first drops...blur a section," reconfiguring dread into legacy without causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto constrains via thawing walls/weeping; lens as micro-setting reveals/charges final image; sensory hierarchy (scent over sight) POV-specific, evolving with urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue memory) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via thaw intensification forcing trade-offs; agency in charcoal-tracing amid visible cost (undocumented loss); one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resistance against erasure emerges via particulars (initials/stories); final image reweights premise non-literally—"loss into legacy"—with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (historical bias in noticing notations); rhythmic modulation builds pressure, diction controlled and biased; no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax propels; metaphors purposeful (palimpsest) without muddle; minor repetition of "rosewater" intentional for texture, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of opera lens revealing bread-initial palimpsest transforms exile trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically.</comment>
