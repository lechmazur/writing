<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's embodied memory-tremble and teaching micro-choices under vow pressure earn strong motivation; Mira's feistiness applies relational crucible without stereotypes. Minor tidy epiphany ("wisdom isn't preserved through isolation") doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via nature-reclamation pattern to RR closure (glowing eyes, shed vow) with conceptual cost legible in final image; orientation anchors immediately, single scene tightens to one deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orchard-rafters constrain ladder-climb choice and charge closure glow through blossoms; sensory details (heavy fruit, pulsing crystals) filter via Elara's mender bias, evolving with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend eyes/bridge wisdom) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via dying-crystals sight forcing vow-break; agency in persistence/endurance forecloses isolation with felt renewal cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of persistent renewal emerges organically from orchard/deciduous vows to resonant final image reweighting rigidity; no moralizing, ambiguity in "accidental wisdom" lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (mender's crystal-resonance notice); dialogue natural/subtextual (Mira's "Council said"), voices distinct by age; rhythm modulates to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel via image integration (e.g., "roots threading like determined fingers"); no loops/artifacts, precise verbs charge mending without overwriting in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quartz-eyes-as-fruit and orchard-cathedral synthesize fresh alchemy-family trope; risk in poetic nature-reclamation pays off in inevitable closure, no derivative hedging.</comment>
