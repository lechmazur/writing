<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Lyra's touch-based art amid sight limitation, earning her transcendence; interiority particular via fractal touch of coin and shelves. Final coin gift seals earned change with relational cost. No unearned epiphanies; flaws drive competent struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries layer from safe to coin to light-portrait, tightening to CR closure where library's fall contrasts enduring face in "space between touching and knowing." Orientation instant; cost legible in demolition rumble vs. preserved essence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tree's grooves, bark ladders, moon gaps constrain mirror choices and charge final light-map image; hush before rumble mirrors internal clarity. Sensory bias via touch filters urgency perfectly. Recurrent coin/shell anchors without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (final portrait) signaled early, deepens via coin revelation narrowing to transcendent light-craft; time pressure forces endurance with felt cost in "breathing its last peaceful breaths." Agency in micro-choices; no reversals needed under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of non-visual identity emerges organically from coin faces, light shadows, to CR: "some things could only be seen by those who couldn't see." Resonant reweight without moralizing; final image answers premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with touch-biased perceptual signature; lyrical rhythm modulates from hush to rumble. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual in scholar's whisper advancing closure. No head-hopping; diction embodies Lyra's precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels without loops; purposeful figures like "fractally precise" integrate sans muddle. Peak clarity in "4:47 AM" line avoids scaffold. Zero artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Face-blind tactility portraits library via coin-spiral light: fresh synthesis of disability, preservation, fractal math. Bold risk in light-as-art transcends tropes; inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes sans gimmick.</comment>
