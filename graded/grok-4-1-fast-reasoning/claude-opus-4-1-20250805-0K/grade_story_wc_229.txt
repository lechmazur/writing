<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied in "screaming tenderness" and trembling fingers aligning with purified love; contradictory guilt/forgiveness impulses act in the forgiveness speech, earning the climactic touch with relational cost. Minor diagnostic edge to "purify intentions" phrasing, but does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds scent density up spiral stairs to Charged Poise closure in solidification ("real enough to hold"); orientation anchored in first paragraph (Mara, lighthouse, post-heat dawn); cost legible in "not fully human" final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse stone "ancient pulse" and lamp beam constrain ascent and charge final shadows dancing; jasmine scent as micro-setting mirrors internal purification, evolving causally with events. Sensory hierarchy (salt, crisp air narrowing to shimmer) fits urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reunite via purified intent) signaled early, textural escalation via scent intensification forces forgiveness renunciation with cost in Thomas's imperfection; agency in uncorking/climbing/beckoning tightens options coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of intentions manifesting love emerges organically from vial release to merged essences; final image of two shadows reconfigures death/life binary with resonant ambiguity, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable, perceptual bias in "hurt to look at directly"; diction/rhythm modulate from crisp dawn to explosive garden sensation at climax; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You don't have to protect me anymore").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied openings and sensory layering; high figurative density in peak ("jasmine scent exploded") purposeful for textural lens but borders overwriting; no loops, clean propulsion to closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost reunion via scent/intentions transforms supernatural trope; risk in "vibrations of intent manifesting molecules" feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
