<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between empirical precision and flooding memories act vividly in the trembling hands lifting the lantern, earning the resignation choice with visible career cost. Interiority concrete via borrowed lives; flaws in protocol-bound observation drive transformation without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory density cascades to Charged Poise closure in phone resignation and lantern promise, with cost legible in "her last official case, but not her last soul saved." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene with vision shards coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tunnel and lantern constrain choices (isolation amplifies visions) and charge final emergence image; rain drumming echoes memories purposefully. Sensory hierarchy reflects POV urgency, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake of probing Jerome's death tightens via memory deepening, forcing agency in resignation that forecloses observer path; cost felt in systemic break. Accumulative pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bondage-to-liberation theme emerges from lantern particulars, reweighted non-literally in rain-baptism image without moralizing. Subtext in generational echoes invites ambiguity on spiritual death.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in "watchfully calm precision"; diction modulates from clinical to resonant under vision stress. Rhythmic control heightens memory cascades.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm in peak memory flood avoids loops. Minor metaphor density in drought/rain fits accumulative texture without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Underground Railroad relic granting entangled memories transforms trope into modern bondage critique; risk in supernatural grounded by empirical contrast heightens closure inevitability.</comment>
