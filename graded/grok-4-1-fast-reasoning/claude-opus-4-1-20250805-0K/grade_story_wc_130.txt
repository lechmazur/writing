<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between methodical proofs and wild dreams act in her inventive mapping of gaps; final endurance of incomplete equation earned via prior placements. Interiority particular through puzzle-solving under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of patterns/ripples tightens to CR closure; cost legible in "chipped mosaic's incomplete equation" reweighting loss. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored in opening descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stalactites/orchard constrain placement choice on mosaic; bioluminescent fungi charge final image mirroring realizations. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific, urgency narrows to hum/ripples.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to reconnect via equation deepens accumulatively with eye placements forcing realization; agency in positioning forecloses full return with felt cost in leaving eyes. One tightening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of "absence, properly calculated" reweights premise non-literally; theme emerges from particulars like fungal calculations without statement. Resonance from mosaic incompleteness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mathematical tracings; rhythmic control modulates to hum/fungi intensity. Elias's voice geometric/subtextual, dialogue advances via implication.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image; rhythm varies with scene urgency, no loops though "mathematics" motif recurs purposefully. Minor overwriting in metaphors contained, closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of taxidermy eyes/emotional math in orchard feels inevitable; risk of abstract conceit transformed via concrete mosaic/fungi.</comment>
