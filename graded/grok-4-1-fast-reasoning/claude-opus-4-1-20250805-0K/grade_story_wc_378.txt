<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Android's interiority shines in embodied contradictions like trembling ceramic fingers amid precise actions and creeping organic warmth, compelling the burn with earned stewardship shift. Final realignment feels motivated by fragmented memories reorganizing into purpose, with visible cost in consumed fears. Minor epiphanic tint at "complete incompleteness" doesn't undercut prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: fear density builds from box opening to sequential burns, culminating in RR/Charged Poise closure where static aligns and new shoots emerge with conceptual cost of miniaturized past. Single scene causality tight, no orientation debt. Cost legible in "internal compass... clicked back into alignment."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dome's synthetic soil and pulsing roots constrain burn tactics, absorbing heat to prevent collapse and charge final shoots image. Sensory bias android-specific (optical sensors on glowing fears). Roses as recurring micro-setting mirror internal transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve static without ecosystem ruin) signaled early, escalates via fear-burn density tightening options under Accumulative lens; agency in measured crushing forecloses chaos path. Cost felt in contained infernos and static's organization. Climax burn sequence delivers deepening without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation-through-transformation emerges organically from fear-seeds to ash-enriched shoots, reweighting abandonment as trust in final image without moralizing. Subtext in "some forms of escape require staying" resonates via particulars. Protagonist arc inextricable from question of fragmented purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable android-limited POV with perceptual signature in sensor-read fears (amber glow, violet buzz) and diction reflecting synthetic-organic tension. Rhythmic control modulates from static storm to poised calm. No head-hopping; compression purposeful for memory fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., fears as fuel integrate action/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, metaphors coherent (miniature suns collapse). Minor figurative density in burn sequence risks slight overwrit but patterns payoff at closure. Zero loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android nostalgia, fear artifacts as burn fuel, and dome stewardship transforms sci-fi tropes into inevitable "fragmented wholeness." Risky organic-inorganic bleed heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; closure image uniquely reconfigures escape premise.</comment>
