<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Precise embodiment of Kira's foresight curse drives micro-choices like descending despite foreseen flood, earning the acceptance at climax; "precisely playful smile" reveals trait under pressure without labels. Internal conflict layers knowing outcomes yet not origins, shown in embodied laugh "both bitter and beautiful" during revelation. Flaw of causal incomprehension compels interface decision with visible cost in drowning bunker.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via timed visions ("in four minutes") to CR closure where "she was remembering it" reconfigures time loop with conceptual cost of illusory choice; legible before/after in final ascent/sunlight image. Orientation anchors early (Kira enters bunker, storm in 17 min). Single scene causality holds, pattern taught immediately pays off without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent moss and rust-bleeding directive filter through Kira's seer bias, constraining choices (water seeps, forces ascent). Storm evolves causally, mirroring internal conquest; final "cathedral rays" and "forest swallowed her footprints" charge CR image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to tactile immediacies (tasting rust) under flood pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to understand path signaled early ("why any of it had to be") tightens via interface revelation changing knowledge/options to acceptance; storm pressure forces agency in wearing crown amid flood. One deepening reweights to endurance cost in "transcending...through acceptance." Legible trade-off in laughing at absurdity while water rises.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of foresight as hindsight emerges organically from neural dreams and loop reveal, resonant in final image reweighting "some paths choose their walkers" without moralizing. Complexity embraces time's origami fold over tidy prophecy; CR carries conceptual cost of choice illusion. Subtext in seal as "marking the exit" lingers via irony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature of precise foresight phrasing ("in seventeen minutes"); syntax/rhythm modulate from calm descent to compressed revelation under flood stress. Voice texture particular via "ghostly blues and greens," biased to prophetic details. No elision or head-hopping; diction fits seer lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "water began seeping...as the storm intensified" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Metaphors consistent ("origami," "mask") without muddle in peak reveal. Minor elevated diction in revelation beat contained, propels to charged final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Time-loop twist transforms precog trope via bunker quantum dreams and reverse causality, fresh synthesis inevitable in "remembering it" CR. Bold risk in backward exit charges stakes without gimmick; ethereal grit voice commits fully to premise implications.</comment>
