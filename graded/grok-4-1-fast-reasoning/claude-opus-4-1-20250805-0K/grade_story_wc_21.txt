<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to uncover truth intensifies compellingly through embodied vertigo and micro-choices like descending; internal conflict over heroes' betrayals acts in scene via synchronized arranging. Final endurance of frailty's weight feels earned. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("truth creates tension") slightly abstracts peak embodiment without harming closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as image density (lagoon, diary, debris) builds to Conceptual Repricing closure: realization reweights premise with searing cost in "courage required to face the full truth." One tightening via shore-arranging narrows knowledge/options; orientation anchored early, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lagoon and zeppelin constrain choices (descent, debris gathering) and charge final infinity-mirror image reconfiguring struggle's complexity. Sensory selection (shimmering black water, bleached wood) filters via archivist urgency; spatial choreography clear across timelines.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode without destroying legacy) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via trap-to-parley-to-arrange deepening knowledge of betrayals/forgiveness. Agency in debris pattern forecloses mythic illusion with felt cost ("searing weight"); pressure coheres without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inseparable love/betrayal emerges organically from betrayed's forgiveness choice and debris cipher; final lagoon-zeppelin reflection offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting myth vs. truth without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable Amara-limited POV with perceptual bias (activist symbols in debris); voice texture modulates rhythmically from vertigo to poise. Dialogue subtextual ("knowing who is different from understanding why") advances stakes naturally, distinct idioms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak debris-arranging beat. Minor elevated diction ("retrocognitively locked") fits archivist lexicon without register drift; final image rhythm charges cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Retrocognitive trap synthesizes civil-rights archive with temporal lagoon ingeniously, transforming tropes via debris cipher revealing forgiveness calculus; risk of dual-timeline coherence heightens stakes, feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
