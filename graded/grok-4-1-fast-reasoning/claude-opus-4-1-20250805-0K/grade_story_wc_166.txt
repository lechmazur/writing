<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority in ritual whisper and embodied transformation compel defiance; endurance of capture cost earned via prior exile choice. Minor archetypal rebel phrasing slightly genericizes without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from dust to nebulae/imprint, Charged Poise closure in "danced on, knowing... gone" with dawn cost legible in final lines. Orientation anchored early; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dew-slicked stones constrain bare-foot dance; wisteria/soil charge final seeding image. Sensory selection (visual starlight, tactile dew) purposeful and POV-biased toward cosmic patterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defiant art pre-detection) signaled early, escalates via dust multiplication narrowing to imprint/capture; agency in dance forecloses safety with felt dawn cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Memory-as-resistance emerges organically from dust ritual and garden seeding; final "eternal" image non-literally reweights exile without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with cosmic/tidal perceptual signature stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from solitude to cosmic hum without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion with varied syntax supports dance build; minor figurative density in nebulae swirl slightly overwrites peak without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tide dance, nostalgia ban, cosmic inscription transforms dystopian tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens defiant closure.</comment>
