<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus's phobias transform into weapons via embodied realization ("Every moment of manufactured fear had taught him"), earning the reversal choice with contradictory fear/certainty impulses acting in the confrontation; Jake applies immediate pressure as creator/handler. Minor slip in quick epiphany at "trembling certainty filled him" borders unearned but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore links (child's cast → decryption → reversal), delivering on-page Decisive Change closure when shells touch and fears transfer ("Jake collapsed, overwhelmed"); cost legible in Jake's vertigo/hydrophobia. Orientation anchored early at door; no ambiguity or shards beyond defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration ("rust and rotting paper," "stellar dust") mirrors internal shift, with library constraining the shadowed emergence and stars recharging final image ("stars that no longer seemed threatening"). POV-filtered (flashlight trembles); no white-room, coherent choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim identity via shell/truth) signaled early, escalates causally through Jake's reset command narrowing to reversal, driven by Marcus's agency; one tightening suffices, with visible cost in fear transfer charging Jake's collapse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of "vulnerability is power" emerges organically from fear-to-weapon arc, resonant in final image ("fears were his strength") reweighting premise without statement; subtext in shell whispers and cast notes avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (phobia-heightened details like "metal's chill seep"); dialogue natural/subtextual ("You made me afraid of everything"), distinct voices (Marcus's laugh vs. Jake's command). Rhythmic control under stress, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("The two halves sang when they touched"); varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors but coherent, not muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stunt double identity crisis into fear-virus reversal, transforming tropes via decryption/mother's revenge; risk in "vulnerability as weapon" feels inevitable from particulars, no templates.</comment>
