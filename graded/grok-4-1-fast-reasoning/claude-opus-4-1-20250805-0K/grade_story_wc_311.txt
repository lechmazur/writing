<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses of duty versus loneliness act simultaneously in the naming scene ("I name you Absence"), earning final endurance of the role with visible cost in descending to duties.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of revelations from recordings to light crystallization culminates in Conceptual Repricing via naming/dissolving monsters, reweighting fears as companions with eternal isolation cost legible in "prepared once more to guide a soul."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Observatory lens and dome constrain the rare light alignment, charging the final folding/tucking of atlas; selective sensory echoes (phrases, clockwork whir) mirror internal states through reaper's biased perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of confronting grief-monsters tightens via light giving them substance, forcing naming agency that forecloses unnamed terror; cost unmistakable in transformed but enduring isolation, though deepening feels more textural than sharply narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of naming grief emerges organically from particulars like wax cylinders and pulsing Kraken; final image of atlas companions offers resonant answer to sacrifice's loneliness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in reaper's mythic noticing ("words still trembled in the air"); rhythmic control modulates from reflective to poised in descent, with stable close-third POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in image-driven sentences like "dusk paint the sky in bruises"; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors during crystallization ("depth, dimension, substance") dulls peak slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychopomp loneliness with atlas monsters as psyche yields inevitable hindsight resonance; risk in lyric accumulative naming transforms reaper trope organically.</comment>
