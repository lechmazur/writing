<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's interior contradiction peaks when his "composure crack[s]" on her revelation, earning his alliance choice with solitude's felt cost; voices distinct, flaws (isolation-fueled abrasiveness) complicate pivot without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: cog evidence → debate → "We know" reversal (DC) → journal handoff with isolation cost legible in "three years alone... preserving truths no one wanted"; orientation anchored by ~50 words, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Flooded ruins (barnacles on marble, green water) constrain hideout choices and charge final "descend[ing] deeper... where the real history waited"; sensory selection POV-biased (historian's eye on strata), evolves with ripples/sunlight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Truth-preservation stake tightens via her counter-revelation, forcing Marcus's alliance agency; cost unmistakable in ending descent foreclosing solitude, under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Competing narratives theme emerges via cog/journal particulars, final image ("sediment... needed time to settle") reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (philosophic lens on "narratives"); dialogue subtextual (goal-pursuit in debate), rhythms modulate tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts, high density (e.g., "Truth isn't democratic" propels); varied syntax/strong verbs, clean propulsion through peak reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh literal-sunken city + self-sabotaged tech premise transformed via cog-strata synthesis; risk in philosophical dialogue heightens stakes organically.</comment>
