<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—forgiveness granted yet contentment elusive—act simultaneously in her climb despite loss, earning the realization as eternal caretaker with embodied unlock in chest. Interiority particular via vineyard-tending lens; micro-choice to climb reveals values hierarchy. Old woman's brief pressure tests without diluting focal clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mist/echoes to spiral perception, voice encounter, CR closure repricing scrolls' loss as illusion with conceptual cost in eternal becoming. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (Mara at grotto, post-forgiveness). Single scene, one tightening via height-enabled pattern sight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Oak roots, scalloped spiral floor constrain climb and charge realization image; jade pin recurs tactilely. Sensory hierarchy (echoes, shadows as wine) reflects ritual priorities, mirroring internal spiral without overtness. Evolving light reveals possibility, integrating causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contentment source) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via climb-enabled sight/voice to foreclose doubt path. Agency in climbing forces encounter; cost felt in pre-realization racing heart, post-reconfiguration patience. One decisive intensification suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of cyclic self-as-wisdom emerges implicitly from spiral image shift (history to possibility) and pin reprise, reweighting forgiveness without statement. Final touch of pin offers non-literal answer to betrayal's scar, charging with ambiguity of endless return.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited perceptual signature (vineyard hush, mist as silk/memory) biases to patient cycles; dialogue subtextual ("You are the territory") advances revelation naturally. Stable distance modulates with heart-race under stress; rhythm distinct, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/artifacts; high density (e.g., "shadows pooled... dark and patient" does triple atmospheric/character/pressure duty). Rhythmic variety peaks in "something unlock[ing] in her chest"; metaphors coherent, voice-motivated without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rebirth tropes via grotto's floating spiral and self-as-map realization grows inevitable from ritual particulars. Risky lyric ascent structure heightens mystic stakes organically, transforming forgiveness cliché through incarnational pin.</comment>
