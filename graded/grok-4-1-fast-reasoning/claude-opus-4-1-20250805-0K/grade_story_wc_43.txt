<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's serene motivation and embodied calm ("hands that never trembled") compel her project and closure choice, with micro-choices like commissioning the frame revealing values. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "hymning the mundane" slightly abstracts interiority, but contradictory serenity amid diagnosis drives earned renunciation without therapy-speak overload.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from results to recording to final gathering, with closure as Charged Poise in vinyl match and Maya's bow/ departure reconfiguring endings as continuations. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (rooftop garden, dawn, results); cost legible in "walked toward whatever came next."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rooftop "Radiant Haven" (clouds at eye level, bamboo rustling) constrains choices (harp placement, gathering) and charges final image (sunlight as anthem). Sensory hierarchy (sounds into music, chamomile scent) filters through Maya's priorities; recurring vinyl/fountain evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via project beats to final recording play, narrowing options with her timeline cost. Agency in reunifying sounds forces trade-off (last performance); price visible in foreclosed work life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in endings emerges organically from vinyl circle and hospice sounds symphony, with final image ("music hung... like a promise") offering non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in fractured/whole reflection avoids platitudes; lingering ambiguity in "whatever came next."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (music in mundane sounds); voice lyrical yet controlled, modulating rhythm at closure ("pulsing stillness"). Brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("I have a different kind of timeline now"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (sounds layered into action); rhythm varies, read-aloud flows. Minor overwriting in repeated "pulsing stillness"/"scent of hope" risks loop (-0.4), but no closure touch; strong verbs/images propel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: broken Beethoven vinyl + hospice sounds album transforms dying trope into musical continuation, with vinyl fit as inevitable turn from particulars. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
