<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in solo confessions like "I'm afraid it won't work" amid compelled honesty, earning the final choice to distribute cure with visible relational cost; interiority embodied in rain-soaked rake work and sleepless tally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through because/therefore chain from descent to truffle find to ingestion DC; closure RR (Charged Poise) lands on-page in throat silence and "she could lie" with felt burden of choice, cost legible in "different burden" sentence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hanging orchard constrains via storm-bent branches and unique mycelium, charging final image of sideways trees mirroring "speak sideways"; sensory hierarchy (earth aroma, thunder) filters through forager urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cure compulsion) signaled early, tightens causally via tin box find narrowing options; agency in drinking forces trade-off, cost unmistakable in post-cure realization of choice's "burden."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of discretion over brutal truth emerges organically from ingestion shift and orchard image reweighting compulsion; resonant non-literal close in pocket "dice" avoids moralizing, inviting fractured mercy reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases to truth confessions and fungal details; rhythm modulates with stress (short ingestion sentences), dialogue natural self-compulsion without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "ground the truffle...watching the iris shift"; varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, though minor reflection density dips pre-climax without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of virus-truth world, Victorian eye cure, and sideways orchard transforms post-apocalypse tropes; risk in solo causal arc with conceptual payoff heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
