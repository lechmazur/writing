<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to preserve wonder drives all actions with consistent traits like her pruner expertise, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the planting scene, limiting 9+ depth. Embodied emotion shines in "heart ache with recognition," tying to her 60-year wait. Final endurance of her life's work feels earned without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from backstory to weaving apertures, culminating in Charged Poise RR as seed splits into dual shoots with felt cost of mended worlds. Orientation anchors early via "verdant parapet" and boundary orchards. No lens ambiguity; closure cost legible in "tiny buds formed, each one containing that precious color."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Verdant parapet and waterfall mist constrain choices—mist as thread, stone depression for soil—charging final image of roots drinking from dual-world flow. Sensory hierarchy via Mira's pruner bias (shimmers, branches) integrates purposefully without catalog. Waterfall pause mid-cascade mirrors internal hush effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via weaving air to dawn planting, narrowing to precise ray with agency in shears-as-needle. One tightening suffices: droplets gathered foreclose ordinary planting. Cost felt in lifetime dedication, visible in stepped-back smile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mending wonder emerges organically from dual shoots spiraling, reweighting nameless color without moralizing. Final image answers preservation question resonantly: buds hold wonder "woven forever between worlds." No tidy binaries; ambiguity in "waiting for those with eyes to see it" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV stable with perceptual signature: Mira notices "shimmer where one reality bled into another." Rhythmic prose modulates to hushed climax ("moment held its breath"), diction purposeful without filter excess. No head-hopping; voice coherent in lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "light from the other world spilled like honey" purposeful in building texture, but dense figuratives in planting beat border overwriting without muddle (−0.4). No loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies for propulsion. Closure image clear: "two shoots spiraling around each other."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pruner shears cut air to weave worlds, transforming orchard trope into liminal magic with dual-sun/moon growth inevitable from setup. Risk in "capturing essence of between-spaces" heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; bold premise commits fully.</comment>
