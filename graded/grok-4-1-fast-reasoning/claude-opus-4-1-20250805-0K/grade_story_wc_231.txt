<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eccentric keeper's gift-curse drives concrete interiority and micro-choices like probing gaps "the way a dentist probes for cavities," earning final pinning with embodied cost of restored isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: gaps align with beam sweeps building to CR closure via temporal scratches revelation, with legible cost in "gaps were...the only parts left intact"; oriented by para 2, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Opal dock and beam constrain discoveries ("at this exact angle"), charging final swimming figure; sensory hierarchy (moonstone colors, salt-cracked palm) mirrors memory surfacing without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to decode gesture escalates via density (fragments → pattern → self-recognition), agency in timing pulse/beam narrowing to CR; cost unmistakable in "his own memories to companion his witnessed isolation."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of persistent gaps/memories emerges via particulars like rice-to-foam; final image reweights premise non-literally as "memories sometimes surface, desperate and gasping," lingering without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (mountain bloom exiled, edited memories) with rhythmic modulation under pressure; elision of full past taught early, paid in lighthouse beam transparency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors (wet clothes, sheet music) integrated; minor figurative density in opening beat purposeful for textural lens, no loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-gift with edited gaps/temporal scratches transforms tropes; risky CR via son-baptism inevitable from Edelweiss particulars, heightening isolation stakes.</comment>
