<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation roots deeply in frustration turning to acceptance, with contradictory impulses vivid in keeping the compass despite instinct to discard; final renunciation earned via greenhouse realization. Interiority concrete and embodied, as in dampness acceptance. Minor slip: grandmother reflection efficient but borders BRR limit without tilting a micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building from failed repairs to pattern density (3/7 clocks) and greenhouse CR closure; cost legible in "I don't fix things anymore," reconfiguring purpose with opportunity foreclosure. Orientation anchored early in workshop/waterfall. One tightening sufficient, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Waterfall vibrations rotate compass and roar as metronome, constraining improvisation; greenhouse leaves organize by points, charging breakthrough image. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (precision hates dampness). Final workshop image recharges motifs without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair to redefine brokenness) tightens accumulatively via ticking patterns to greenhouse deepening, narrowing fix-or-abandon options; agency in suspending compass forces trade-off. Cost visible in visitors' refusal, charging poise. No reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection's precision emerges via clock discord harmonized by compass, resonant in final image without moralizing. Complexity in "possibilities" ambiguity lingers. Minor friction: realization line "befriend uncertainty" borders echo (−0.3), but dramatized prior.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (time indifference, pattern-noticing bias); rhythm modulates from metronomic repair to swirling chaos. Delivery dialogue natural/subtextual. No head-hopping, compression purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy sentences in greenhouse); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures. Propulsion aligns with pressure peaks. Minor repetition of "ticking" purposeful for pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: compass orchestrates discordant clocks into "temporal map," transforming repair trope via greenhouse logic. Risk in lyric CR pays off, inevitable in hindsight. No derivatives.</comment>
