<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority peaks in "teeth ache and her heart skip in syncopation," revealing contradictory impulses of logical math versus ancestral tremble; earned transformation via micro-choices like adapting breath. Minor abstraction in ancestral memory dilutes raw contradiction under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from vibrations to perfect resonance; on-page CR closure in "Mira had adapted... eternally singing" with cost of lost humanity (empty room, folded coat). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via Collectors' arrival forces ritual completion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains via groaning platforms, frozen door vibrations, spiral stairs' notes shaping descent and voice-matching; final beam image charges closure shimmer. Sensory hierarchy (sonic primacy) reflects engineer's bias; details evolve with ritual intensification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect artifact) tightens accumulatively as resonance builds against Collectors' approach; agency in vibrational ritual forecloses human path with visible cost (melted key, abandoned coat). Escalation driven by her deepening sync, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of covenant/transcendence emerges via flesh-to-sound images, reweighted in final "shimmer of blue against gold" without moralizing; protagonist arc inextricable from sonic becoming. Resonance from particulars like bioluminescent pulse mirroring her pulse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with sonic perceptual signature ("bone could conduct"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in climax hum-to-resonance without head-hopping. Lyrical diction purposeful and taught early, modulating ethereal texture under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "door shuddered, then sang back"); varied rhythm propels to climax without loops or scaffolds. Consistent sonic metaphors avoid muddle; zero artifacts in peak resonance beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic physics and ancestral ritual transforms lighthouse trope into flesh-becoming-wave; risk in CR closure heightens stakes via irreplaceable artifact logic. Inevitable hindsight from early harmonics to dispersed voice.</comment>
