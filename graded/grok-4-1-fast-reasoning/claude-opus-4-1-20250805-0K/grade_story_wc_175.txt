<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation rooted in grandmother's lore compels micro-choices like knotting stems, with embodied gentleness revealing esoteric realism; internal reverence for impermanence earns the closure endurance of descent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to butterfly's landing on moth wing, delivering Charged Poise CR where structures dissolve with conceptual cost of ephemerality legible in "By evening, her structures had already begun to dissolve."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Grotto's dew and moss constrain weaving (fibers dissolve soon), charging final image of vanishing traces; sensory hierarchy (powdery scales, prisms) mirrors Mira's delicate perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of signaling monarch tightens via timed building under dissolution pressure; butterfly arrival deepens as Accumulative cadence shift, with cost felt in fleeting contact and Mira's dark descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of impermanent histories emerges via knotted patterns and dissolving monuments, resonating in butterfly-moth wing touch that reweights overlooked persistence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical 3rd-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in delicate noticing ("air itself might bruise"); rhythmic modulation suits Accumulative texture, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful figures (e.g., "prisms that hung like unfinished sentences"); minor non-closure overwriting in metaphors doesn't dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological myth (moth-encoded histories, cloud dwellers) transforms ephemerality trope; risk of lyric Accumulative structure heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
