<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mariel's micro-choices—mixing dust into ink, weaving rebel notes—reveal contradictory serenity amid risk, culminating in earned closure as she seals scores; interiority particular via grandmother's whisper anchoring present resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: radio crackle seeds density to final CR (radio's persistent glow reconfigures hope), with legible cost in dawn's approach foreclosing night vigil; single scene anchors orientation early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ember alcove's heat and radio glow constrain transcription, charging final image of mist-cloaked exit; sensory hierarchy (amber light on fingers, crackling static) reflects copyist's priorities without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reviving stories via music) tightens accumulatively as pirate song personalizes mission ("They knew about her"), forcing endurance with felt risk/cost in signal waver and dawn pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of indestructible stories emerges via dust/luminous images shifting from traumatized silence to activation; final radio glow offers non-literal CR repricing narrative suppression without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature in light/dust attunement ("painted her fingers in amber light"); rhythmic modulation peaks in thistled calm line, compression purposeful under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/atmosphere (e.g., "collected the ambient particles... mixing them with her specially prepared ink"); minor figurative density in metaphors avoids muddle, propulsion clean to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of story famine with luminous dust/notes transforms dystopia via dust-as-memory logic; risk in lyric conceit heightens stakes, inevitable in final image of awakening city.</comment>
