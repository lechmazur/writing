<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marta's interiority shines in embodied actions like weathered hands pausing on the bell rope; dialogue with Samuel reveals character-specific values without epiphany. Secondary pressure from Samuel fits scope. Minor telling in backstory summaries slightly flattens contradiction in pivotal endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solo acts to community exchange, tightening at basket discovery and officials' arrival. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in final bell ring with Marta's tiredness as felt cost ("She was tired now"). Heavy summary of runs creates outline-like sequencing without full on-page linkages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arbor and bell recur as micro-setting constraining gatherings and charging final image; sensory selection (echoing toll, dark paths) reflects Marta's priorities. Atmosphere of ridge isolation mirrors stakes. Spatial choreography clear despite time jumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of survival-through-connection signaled early, escalates accumulatively via reciprocal baskets and self-sustaining shadows, converging at officials' frustrated demand. One tightening (community takeover) narrows Marta's role with visible cost (exhaustion). Agency in initiating pattern coherent under lens; summaries dilute visceral pressure on peak beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of faceless kindness forging identity emerges organically from acts and silences, resonating in unified crowd neutrality against officials. Final image reconfigures anonymity from survival tool to communal essence without moralizing. Ambiguity in "threads became invisible" invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Marta with perceptual bias toward quiet dignity; voice rhythmic and textured ("benevolent shadows"). Sparse dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("need has no face"), advances revelation. No head-hopping; compression in summaries purposeful for accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Varied rhythm and density propel via image integration (e.g., "shadows would emerge"); no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Minor paraphrase in donation descriptions ("anonymous packages...fresh vegetables") but purposeful motif. Elevated diction fits wise POV without drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sanctions isolation transformed by reciprocal anonymity into dignified self-reliance; officials' silence subverts savior trope thoughtfully. Premise avoids template via bell's ritual evolution. Risk in quiet closure heightens resonance.</comment>
