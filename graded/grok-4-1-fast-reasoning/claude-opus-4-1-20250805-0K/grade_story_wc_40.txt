<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elena's reticence contrasts sharply with her compelled testimony, embodied in pocketing the warming crystal before revealing it, earning her final non-linear stance. Contradictory impulses act in scene via her preference for etymologies over people yet documenting neologisms like "grief-tender." Minor epiphanic summary in notes slightly tempers perfection, but closure choice feels earned with institutional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as crystal observations densify toward testimony, with clear orientation by para 2 (library, dawn, 2050 post-2047). Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page in final para: crystal "sang with reflected sound," reweighting frozen language with conceptual cost to Committee's taxonomy. One tightening via Committee entry narrows to her fractured method; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shadowed library at dawn anchors selectively, with dust motes and ancient glass filtering through Elena's bias; crystal as micro-setting constrains perception, charging final image where it "split the morning light into impossible colors." Sensory hierarchy reflects etymologist urgency (breathing books, blooming words). Environment guides choice: dawn light enables refractions pivotal to testimony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (testify on anomalies) signaled early, accumulates texturally via crystal glimpses tightening to Committee's entry, forcing her renunciation of linear speech. Agency in pulling crystal forecloses expected testimony with felt institutional cost. Escalation coheres under Accumulative lens with pattern break in final image; minor abstractness in stakes declaration tempers score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of language as "living garden" emerges organically from crystal refractions (words "blooming in the margins like mushrooms after rain"), reweighted in ending silence where "new language was already taking root." Resonant non-literal answer avoids moralizing; subtext in fractured sequences invites ambiguity without confusion. Final image recharges seed motif with conceptual cost to codification.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature: etymological lyricism ("grief-tender," "time-drunk") biases noticing toward linguistic life. Rhythmic control modulates from hushed dawn to peaked testimony; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("I claim nothing... what grows in the spaces"). No head-hopping; diction reflects scholar's weathered innocence under rising pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences layer image/action (e.g., "crystal knew better" pivots revelation). Varied rhythm, no loops; figurative density (breathing shelves, prism light) taught early via crystal pattern, coherent in reflective beats. Minor overwriting in metaphors like "breadcrumbs home" risks muddle but spares closure; strong verbs anchor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise transforms frozen-language trope via sonically reflective crystal revealing neologisms, synthesizing etymology and sci-fi organically. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; final reconfiguration ("testimony not with words but with the silence between them") feels inevitable from prior particulars. Fresh "weathered innocence" smile amid authority freshens confrontation.</comment>
