<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—preserve crystal vs. release it—act simultaneously in the sublimation beat; final renunciation earned by grandfather's legacy and starlings' cue, with embodied cost in empty satchel. Interiority particular (lungs remember first breath) avoids labels; flaws (secret sentimentality vs. rational colleagues) complicate peak choice without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns (waterfall, starlings, crystal) builds to CR closure in sublimation line ("vapor rose and mingled"), reweighting transformation premise with conceptual cost of released wonder. Orientation anchored in opening paragraph; single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard's spiral pears and prismatic waterfall constrain crystal's handling and charge final image (rainbows fragment); sensory hierarchy (taste of centuries, starlings' geometry) filters through alchemist's priorities. Micro-setting (dew-harvesting leaves) mirrors internal wonder without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonize logic/intuition before transformation) signaled early, tightens via starlings' aerial formula clarifying months-long gap; agency in flaming crystal forecloses preservation path with felt opportunity cost. Escalation under Accumulative lens via pattern break suffices, though lacks Causal "therefore" snap.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (wonder's translation via liminal spaces) emerges from particulars—crystal's sublime, starlings' breath—reweighting logic's premise in final image without moralizing. Resonance in orchard's "ancient freshness" callback avoids platitudes; subtext in sentimental denial layers ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (equations in birds, poetry in universe); rhythmic control modulates from calculation to wild warmth under release pressure. Lyrical diction ("cursive mathematics") consistent, no head-hopping or filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences vary rhythm (short sublimation strike vs. flowing patterns); no loops, though figurative density borders overwrite in starlings beat but serves textural lens payoff. Clarity intact at closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical orchard and starling-formula turn feels inevitable; risk in lyric Accumulative drive transforms trope (epiphany quest) via irreplaceable crystal geometry, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
