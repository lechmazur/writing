<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's recluse traits compel her careful approach and box-lifting choice under ghostly pressure, with embodied caution ("careful steps of someone who had learned") earning final endurance; grandfather's tranquil gaze in life/death reveals inherited contradiction between disturbance and duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from ghost gestures to box contents realization, landing CR closure in "clutch[ing] the box, understanding her purpose" with solitude cost legible; orientation anchored in first paragraph, pattern holds seamlessly to end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Apiaries as "broken teeth" and scorched oasis constrain Mara's isolation-tending actions; stained glass box charges final image as "captured sunset," mirroring internal silence with undeniable tactile warmth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding ghosts tightens via box revelations under Accumulative lens, forcing endurance renunciation with cost in "remain[ing] here, the last keeper"; agency in lifting/clutching forecloses scattering option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Silence-as-betrayal theme emerges organically from unsent letters and gesture-clues, resonating in final "language of omission" without statement; box reprise reweights covenant failure into preservation love.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward hive patterns and omissions; lyrical rhythm modulates from observational calm to charged poise, distinct texture in "buzz[ing] like phantom bees."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with no loops/artifacts, rhythm varies propulsively ("hummed—not with bees... but with something older"); metaphors cohere (honey/combs/sunset) without muddle, propelling to luminous closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ghosts replaying extinct bee-tending transforms post-apoc isolation into silence-preservation ingenuity; risk of mute specters heightens stakes via gesture-only drive, organic to closure.</comment>
