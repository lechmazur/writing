<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Embodied motivation shines in "fingers ached from writing" and studious micro-choices like crouching to listen; endurance of ongoing work earned with felt physical cost. Minor slip: no simultaneous contradictory impulses shown in pivotal charting beat, limiting 9+ depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as notations build density toward dawn Charged Poise; closure reconfigures stakes in "never complete" with conceptual cost of perpetual recovery legible in notepad's warm close. Orientation anchored early in mountaintop arrival; no slips touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bonsai labyrinth and fountain constrain choices via "temporal signature" refractions, charging final tea image; sensory hierarchy (hum through droplets) reflects studious POV bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of history recovery tightens accumulatively via hum modulation and dawn thinning; agency in charting forecloses completion with ache cost, but lacks micro-turn reversal for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. erasure emerges organically from tree scars and gold-leaf protest; final "trees would remember" offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "textures of different times"; stable close-third POV with rhythmic modulation under dawn pressure, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in charting beats; varied rhythm avoids loops, though opening figurative stack ("manuscript written in living wood") borders density excess without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenious sonic-tree-history synthesis feels inevitable from early notepad seed; bold restraint risks lyric poise, heightening conceptual stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
