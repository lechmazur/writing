<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority shines in embodied cues like feeling atmospheric pressure and vial warmth, driving micro-choices that earn the woman's transformation; her anxiety patterns feel particular, not stock. Minor slip: her shift from rigid to smiling resolves slightly swiftly without deeper contradictory impulse shown on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as terraces build density toward Charged Poise closure in the Prism Crown and descent, where woman's smile and train-listening reconfigure silence with felt emotional cost legible in "finding peace in that gradual dissolution." Orientation anchors crisply by para 2; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism terraces constrain choices via sound refraction (Ruby absorbs, Sapphire amplifies), charging final hush; train whistle recurs tactilely, mirroring internal shift from sharp to lullaby. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific, no white-room—vial and cables ground body in space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide passenger through silence paradox) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via vial swirl, terrace responses, and guidance deepening to woman's shoulders dropping; agency in tilting gondola forecloses distress path with visible cost in slowed breathing matching rhythm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as "presence without intrusion" emerges via particulars like delayed gasp in Opal Arch, reweighting train echo non-literally in final descent image without moralizing; resonance inextricable from Marcus's arc, invites ambiguity on loneliness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with Marcus's perceptual signature (sound pockets, air-reading); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Too loud") advances without exposition. Rhythm modulates with intensity, no head-hopping; minor register elevation in terrace names fits voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., vial swirl signals pressure while embodying expertise); varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Minor: occasional sound-refraction phrasing borders paraphrase in mid-terraces but integrates purposefully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic prisms transforms silence trope via lived navigation and vial as storm-sense; risk in surreal terraces heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight through pattern-taught world rules without retreat.</comment>
