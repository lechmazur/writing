<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marina's motivation rooted in research intensifies through embodied vertigo ("vertigo of trapped freedom"); contradictory impulses peak in final micro-choice to pocket card despite softening features. Coraline applies crucible pressure via revelations. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("blissfully aberrant") slightly abstracts but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of revelations (swatch, horses, theater cards) reweights existence stake. Orientation anchored early (ship, tracking twin). CR closure legible with cost: "choosing the harder freedom" as features soften, final image undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog and decay constrain choices (memories alter mid-scene, ship creaks goodbye pressuring descent). Carousel mare's emerald eyes charge swatch reprise in pocket. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (decay shades via scientist lens).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture proof) signaled early, deepens via memory alteration narrowing options to remember/forget. Agency in pocketing card forecloses path with felt cost under textural lens. Escalation via revelation density charges final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory-existence emerges organically via particulars (swatch warmth, pinned cards); final image ("emerald swatch remained solid... fragment of sister-color") non-literally reweights premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in "harder freedom."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (cellular/ decay metaphors). Voice rhythmic, modulates intensity (short sentences in fog horn moment). Dialogue subtextual, goal-driven (Coraline's explanations advance stakes).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative density (tentacles canvas, sugar minerals) consistent for textural lens but borders overwriting in theater reveal, slightly dulling peak propulsion without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chimera science + forgotten names garden on carnival ship transforms twin trope via specific DNA/memory logic. Risky poetic texture heightens stakes; inevitable hindsight in swatch as birthstone reveal.</comment>
