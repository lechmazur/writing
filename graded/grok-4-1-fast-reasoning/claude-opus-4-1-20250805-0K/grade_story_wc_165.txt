<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Analytical traits root motivation in consistent observation, compelling repertoire shifts for audiences; embodied in thumb on bishop groove. Internal conflict subtle in illusion vs. calculation, but no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limit to strong band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: performance cycles build density to tide's return; CR closure in "waves erased his footprints" reconfigures ongoing variations with impermanence cost legible in packing. Orientation anchored early in boardwalk/arcade/stars; one meaningful cadence tightening via clocked cycles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tidal arcade constrains timing/choice via clock and rising foam, charging final erasure image; sensory hierarchy (acoustics, sight lines) POV-filtered through performer priorities. Evolving details (exposed to flooding) mirror internal patterns without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of timed performances signaled early, deepened accumulatively via repertoire agency for emotional frequencies and teenager interaction; tide pressure coheres to foreclose window with felt coin/pick yield. No reversal but cadence shift narrows options legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchestrating randomness emerges organically from bishop mechanism and adaptations; final "nothing would be identical" image offers resonant reweighting of patterns with cost of erasure, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with analytical perceptual signature ("calculating sight lines," pattern catalogs); rhythmic diction modulates calmly, distinct texture in marine-inflected syntax. Minimal dialogue natural and goal-pursuing ("Life's a chess match").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied openings/rhythm; purposeful marine metaphors ("foam fingers," "pinholes") cohere without muddle or loops. Strategic showing integrated into acts avoids scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of analytical busking via bishop gimmick and tidal stage transforms trope; risk in mechanism pays off in charged interactions, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
