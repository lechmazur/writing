<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly when Elara extends the drawer pull despite her brother's death, earning her acceptance of Thorne's apology as "down payment" with relational cost. Interiority particular via thumb-tracing grooves under pressure. Flawless voice distinction in dialogue reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dialogue density reconfigures grievances into charged poise for tomorrow's exchange. Orientation anchored immediately in parapet/neutral territory. Closure's Charged Poise lands cleanly in final image of drawer pull pocketed amid mist, with deferred forgiveness as conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist and parapet constrain handover choice and charge final image of Elara waiting with drawer pull. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's priorities (mist softens edges). Drawer pull as micro-setting evolves tactilely across beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of exchange tightens via revelation of parallel mistakes, narrowing vengeance option; agency in drawer pull handover forces trade-off. Escalation through apology density reweights with felt grief cost. Price legible in "forgiveness...after tomorrow's exchange."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of drawer pull as "recycled sorrow, polished smooth by time" resonantly reweights theme without moralizing. Wisdom emerges organically from particulars like moon phases and heirloom. No tidy binaries; ambiguity in deferred healing lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elara's perceptual signature (mist as confession, grooves familiar as breathing). Dialogue natural/subtextual, pursuing goals (e.g., Thorne's "Why?" evades then yields). Rhythmic control modulates to hushed poise at close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with lines like "mist coiled around the stone battlements, softening edges" advancing atmosphere/action. Rhythmic variety; no loops or overwriting—metaphors purposeful (e.g., "scraping from his throat like rust"). Propulsion peaks in apology beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of heirloom diplomacy and lunar wisdom transforms prisoner exchange trope; drawer pull/moon phases feel inevitable. Risk in quiet poise heightens stakes without gimmick. No derivative echoes.</comment>
