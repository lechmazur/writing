<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's gift for hearing unspoken words roots his motivation and enables concrete micro-choices like positioning the pawn amid warnings; Elena's shift from sobs to confident move shows earned internal conflict. Blind spots in authority's fear balance competence. Final realization in her seventh move feels particular, not epiphanic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from library warnings to town-wide displays and arrivals, culminating in CR via Elena's "Checkmate" whisper and parting mist reweighting rebellion's quiet success. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via 9pm chimes suffices. Cost legible in "watchers come with morning."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt library's pulsing walls and magnetic grotto constrain choices—pieces hover, warnings thrum—charging final pulse of approval; mist evolution mirrors rising stakes. Sensory filter (Marcus's hearing) selective; starlit alcove scales to climax image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (planting thought-rebellion) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Elena's crisis and displays' ripple, forcing stance crystallization in gatherings. Father's threat and library warnings make cost felt; agency in pawn moves and timing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of overthrowing unexamined thought emerges via chess metaphors shifting to real rebellion; subtext in unspoken realizations avoids statement. Final "Checkmate" to old world reconfigures premise non-literally, lingering ambiguity in watchers' threat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (hearing hearts/library); voice modulates rhythmically from thrumming pulse to declarative whispers. Dialogue goal-driven with subtext ("your father's right about one thing"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image; rhythm varies with short punches at moves ("church bells chimed nine"). Minor register elevation ("amplified quiet" motif) purposeful, no loops dulling closure; "forests of second thoughts" propels without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical library, chess as rebellion code, and mind-hearing transforms trope of quiet resistance; window displays' ingenuity inevitable from lessons, risking poetic tone that heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
