<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and embodied contradiction in "beauty of it pressed against her throat, choking her," driving earned restoration; guilt endures as visible cost in final choice. Contradictory impulses act on-page via card-laying despite persistent flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure at "saucer's crack sealed itself with liquid starlight," reweighting regret with cost (guilt remains); orientation anchored early, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Silver grass that "chimed when touched" and saucer constrain ritual choices and charge final mending image; sensory hierarchy reflects POV urgency, selective and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim time/unfasten binding) signaled early tightens via card spread and sealing, driven by agency; cost legible in endured guilt, but stakes slightly abstract pre-climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed time emerges organically via traced hands as "map" in final image, reweighting premise without moral; resonant non-literal answer to regret's mercy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in onyx-ink lyricism ("black snow") stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation under pressure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful figural pattern (cracks, traces) propels without loops or artifacts; peak clarity at "cards fell like black snow" avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy and temporal glades transforms regret tropes; hand-tracing as hidden map feels inevitable, bold lyric risk heightens stakes.</comment>
