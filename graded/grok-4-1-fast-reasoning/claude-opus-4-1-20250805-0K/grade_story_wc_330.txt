<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emil's quiet persistence and damaged hearing root clear motivation, with embodied impulse to follow the fragment compelling the climactic song; interior contradiction between silence and possibility acts in the stumble and fitting, earning change with rusty voice cost. Minor slip: epiphany at angel's expression borders unearned without deeper prior micro-choice tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from fragment discovery to garden revelation and song as Charged Poise closure; causality holds via pull and stumble, with legible cost in "rusty from disuse, cracked and whispered." Orientation anchored early in workshop; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (sawdust shafts, moss-covered horses, trickling water) filter through Emil's carving bias; train cars and garden constrain via loose board stumble and halo fit, charging final "whispering gleam" image. Micro-setting of fragment and bells evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of silence-as-possibility signaled early tightens accumulatively through fragment pull and garden discovery, narrowing to song agency; one deepening reversal at halo fit forecloses muteness with felt imperfection cost. Minor abstractness in initial stake declaration slightly mutes visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of brokenness singing emerges organically from persistence motif shifting at song/climax; final image of horses brightening reweights silence without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on resurrection's quiet cost. Resonance inextricable from Emil's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with lyrical perceptual signature (fog as memories, light in damaged ears); rhythmic diction modulates from hush to shimmer without slippage, voice biased to carving/wooden secrets. No dialogue; elisions purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image integration (e.g., "light spread like water, not harsh but whispering"); purposeful "misting hush" repetition patterns texture without loops. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (fog/breath/memory) borders coherence slip in opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of circus ruin into living garden oasis via halo fragment transforms abandonment trope; risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes through textural hush-to-song cadence, inevitable in hindsight with no gimmickry.</comment>
