<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ezra's motivation as nurturer of fragile threads is concrete and particular, shown through scanner use and drone loading; micro-choices under Keeper's arrival reveal value hierarchy with quiet endurance cost. Limited contradictory impulses prevent higher band, but competence balanced by border risks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from scanner absences to drone ballet and Keeper's arrival; CR closure in bottle delivery reweights divide with conceptual cost legible in "forces can't be contained by lines on maps." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade as neutral waystation constrains choices via roof gap for drones and rusted mail drop; recurring neon glow charges final fade image, mirroring internal states through tactile navigation. Sensory selection urgent and POV-biased toward patterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fostering border connections signaled early, deepens via Keeper confrontation narrowing to bottle handoff with felt faith cost; agency in delivery forecloses official-only path. Mild escalation limits to strong but not exceptional under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of healing broken promises emerges organically from absences, drones, and bottled storm; final image offers resonant CR repricing borders as artificial without moralizing. Particulars like coordinates etching avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in noticing "gaps where addresses should have been"; Keeper dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("It remembers"). Rhythmic modulation supports accumulative build without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "mechanical ballet"), but minor paraphrase loops on "broken promises" and "absences" dull propulsion slightly; rhythm varies well overall. No closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of postal rebellion with bottled storm and absence-linking transforms smuggling trope; risk in lyric closure heightens stakes via uncontainable forces premise fully committed to.</comment>
