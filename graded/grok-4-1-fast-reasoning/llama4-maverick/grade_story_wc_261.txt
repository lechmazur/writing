<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to read scars drives consistent actions like clutching the hourglass and tunneling, rooted in traits like wound-opening penchant. Interiority concrete in embodied ache and maelstrom mind during digging, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning on summary epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from entry whispers to breakthrough glow; Charged Poise closure lands on-page as "sense of closure wash over them" with felt exertion cost in "ragged breathing, chest heaving." One meaningful deepening suffices; orientation anchored early in tower at dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Luminescent plants and damp earth constrain descent/digging choices, mirroring internal secrets; coffee rings and hourglass as micro-settings charge perceptual bias. Sensory hierarchy vivid and selective, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to read scars signaled early via tunneling goal; escalation deepens under Accumulative lens as density shifts from oppressive silence to unfurling stories, narrowing to chamber breakthrough with agency and visible exertion cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of closure in scars' stories emerges organically from coffee rings, plant whispers, and tunneling, reweighted in final chamber image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like "stories in the scars begin to unfurl," inviting ambiguity on ongoing journey.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in shimmering symbols, plant susurrus, and frosted pulses; rhythmic poetic diction modulates from heavy air to electric possibility, consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density overwrites digging peak ("maelstrom... pulse... electric... boundless sea") without pattern payoff, dulling propulsion; minor paraphrase loops on silence/whispers across paragraphs trigger scaffold penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant telepathy, coffee-ring divination, and scar-reading quest transforms tropes into organic quest; tunneling payoff feels inevitable from established particulars without hedging.</comment>
