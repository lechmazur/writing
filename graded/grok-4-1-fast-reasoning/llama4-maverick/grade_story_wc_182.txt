<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara's final realization ("she was no longer content to simply uncover knowledge") feels unearned and diagnostic, lacking embodied micro-choices or contradictory impulses under pressure; traits like resourcefulness are labeled rather than shown complicating decisions. Time traveler remains one-note without status dynamics or pressure on Elara.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore progression from meeting to diary to library, and CR closure lands via Elara's purpose shift with pursuers' cost felt in final image; however, "series of rescue missions" summarizes pivotal beats without on-page causality, softening tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Labyrinthine shelves and "scent of old parchment" vividly anchor and guide navigation, with hidden door constraining climax entry; sensory selection fits urgency but lacks body/tool constraints on choices for higher band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (library find) tightens causally at diary grab with pursuers closing, forcing renegotiation; agency low as conflicts (pursuers) remain off-page and abstract, with no visible cost altering tactics beyond summary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge-to-application emerges via library discovery but final paragraphs moralize ("found something far more valuable than mere knowledge") in prompt-like echo, replacing resonance with tidy assertion; lacks non-literal final answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with consistent perceptual bias toward lore, but narrative voice drifts to elevated diction ("vibrate with an unheard symphony") mismatched to Elara's lexicon; minimal dialogue advances goals cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("labyrinthine bookstore," "unheard symphony") creates paraphrase loops and template cadence in ending ("Elara smiled," journey motifs); overwriting with stacked modifiers dulls climax propulsion and closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Bookstore-as-maze with time traveler offers genre tropes without fresh synthesis; mountain scale and diary reprise feel organic but derivative, lacking bold transformation of conventions.</comment>
