<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation to transform pain drives singing and closure slumber; embodied longing via "pang" and vigil weight. Minor slips in label-speak like "shyly unstoppable" and over-articulated epiphany reduce contradiction depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from postcard trigger to song cadence shift; RR closure in "weight...begin to lift" and slumber reconfigures longing with felt endurance cost. Orientation anchored early in shell sanctuary; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory glow of fungi and shell expanse mirrors internal shift from prison to womb, charging final image. Details filter through poet's priorities, constraining isolation while evolving with song ("darkness outside receded").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to photosynthesize pain signaled early, tightens accumulatively via postcard-song deepening to joy. Mild internal pressure lacks sharp trade-off, but agency in lullaby forecloses insomnia with legible cost in vigil lift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of art transcending sorrow emerges organically via creation acts; final notebook/postcard image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Minor overt restatements like repeated transformation dilute subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct poetic perceptual signature (celestial swirls, bioluminescent pulse); rhythmic modulation suits lyric mode. Voice consistent, selective noticing biases toward beauty in darkness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn on "transform pain/beauty" (e.g., turmoil->transmute->photosynthesize->transformed across paragraphs) create redundancy; overwriting with metaphors like "river of moonlight" in most sentences dulls propulsion. Template cadence in repetitive image restatements obscures closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mollusk-shell sanctuary and galactic postcard catalyzes poet's pain-to-beauty arc organically. Risky lyric sci-fi tone transforms isolation trope via "womb" reconfiguration.</comment>
