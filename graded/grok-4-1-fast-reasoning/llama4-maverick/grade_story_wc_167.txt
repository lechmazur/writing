<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>No internal conflict or contradictory impulses act in scene; abstract affirmations like "felt a sense of peace settle over her" repeat without embodiment or micro-choices under pressure, leaving motivation declarative and unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of reflective observations building to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in final urgency ("before everything shifts") and reconfiguration of purpose, but lacks meaningful tightening or pattern break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pearl Bay and prism atrium anchor vividly and charge final image ("prism atrium stood as a reminder"); sensory details selective via glazier bias, though pond/bay slip and visual overload minor slips.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Abstract dominant stake (uncover hidden patterns) lacks on-page test or narrowing; no agency-driven escalation or felt trade-off under Accumulative lens, static affirmations deflate pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden beauty emerges from ripple/prism images with final resonant reconfiguration, but overt restatements ("illuminate value in the mundane") border on platitudes without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of pattern-seeking, but repetitive phrasing ("felt a sense of") erodes rhythmic control and texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops ("felt a sense of" x7+, patterns/reckonings churn) and template cadence ("As she stood there...") dull all beats including closure; synonym redundancy kills density and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Familiar meditative artist trope untransformed by specific risks; checklist elements (glazier, noctilucent) feel stitched without fresh synthesis.</comment>
