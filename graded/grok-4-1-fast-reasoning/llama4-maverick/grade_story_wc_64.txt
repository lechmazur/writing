<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Gardener's motivation to uncover intentions behind echoes roots actions consistently, intensifying through immersion, but lacks embodied contradictory impulses or flaws complicating peak choices like untangling; change to attuned purpose feels earned accumulatively yet lacks deeper internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tending to silo work, pattern emergence in threads/crystal tightens to CR closure where world reweights with echoes' thrum, cost felt in unending journey; single scene coherent, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silo's velveteen gloom, lavender dust, starlight constrain and charge immersion, mirroring internal attunement; sensory details selective (touch of threads, hum of crystal) evolve purposefully without static repetition, charging final image of altered reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape of intentions) signaled early, accumulates via persistent untangling post-clock, one deepening in discerned pattern/message narrows to attuned purpose; agency in dedication shows trade-off of time/immersion, cost legible in "journey far from over."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of echoes revealing intentions beyond death emerges organically from particulars (tapestry code, crystal hum), reweighted in final starlit attunement without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in ongoing quest, resonant via charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature attuned to tender touches, scents, vibrations; voice texture poetic yet controlled, modulating rhythm in "soft whisper of threads" under immersion without drift or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("gardener," "echoes," "tenderly," "night wore on") creates paraphrase loops and template cadence in descriptive runs, dulling propulsion; overwriting in stacked adjectives (ethereal glow, intricate patterns) muddles high-immersion beats, though grammar clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh gothic synthesis of cemetery mysticism with tactile unraveling and echo-attunement transforms tropes via lived specificity; risk in accumulative quiet ending heightens purpose without gimmick, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
