<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete but generic with stock phrasing like "deep pools of contemplation"; lacks contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure, reducing motivation test to serene pondering without earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via meditative build from pondering to polishing; charged poise closure in polished sea glass as pearl with felt cost of dedication legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto mist and damp stone constrain meditative action and mirror internal tranquility; sensory details like "damp earth and faint tang of salt" selective and purposeful, charging final glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of sharing stillness signaled early but abstract; single accumulative deepening via polishing lacks option-narrowing trade-off or visible price beyond mild effort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Pearl of stillness emerges organically from polishing without fire, resonating in sea glass's shine as non-literal answer reweighting gentle transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature attuned to luminescence; rhythmic serenity fits but minor repetition erodes distinction under sustained calm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops restating tranquility ("soft," "gentle," "peace" churn); figurative overload like repeated "zephyr bloom" without payoff dulls propulsion throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Sea glass polishing as stillness vessel offers fresh inflection on transformation trope, but meditative grotto serenity leans on familiar contemplative archetype without bold risk.</comment>
