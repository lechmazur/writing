<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority relies on stock mystical phrasing like "deep sense of connection" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; no flaws complicate the smooth spell-weaving success.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from sensed interruption to perceptual expansion and CR closure in final images of stirring giant and reconfigured city rhythm, legible cost in tremor and incomprehensible secrets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rooftop canal and pendant as micro-settings constrain spell-weaving choice (water's flow warps, pendant glows against skin) and charge final image of glowing pendant amid renewed purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to find echoes tightens via spell-induced deepening (perception expands, vortex reveals place); agency in weaving spell forecloses normal sketching with felt cost of giant's imminent wake in tremor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden infinite cadences emerges organically from interruption to echo discovery, resonant CR in final city appreciation reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with illustrator-biased perceptual signature (tracing light dances, patterns in stones); rhythmic prose modulates effectively during time-warp beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Synonym loops on rhythm/cadence/flow/song across spell-weaving ("languid... warped... slowing") and figurative density ("frantic dance... swirling vortex... ethereal light") muddle peak clarity without taught pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of illustrator borrowing subterranean giant's nap-time via pendant transforms urban fantasy tropes through specific perceptual patterns and echo-vortex payoff.</comment>
