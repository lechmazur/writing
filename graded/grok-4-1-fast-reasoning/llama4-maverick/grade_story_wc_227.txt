<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Uncertain alchemist trait told early but shown inconsistently through competent precision under desperation; interiority concrete yet repetitive with stock epiphanies like "pride and accomplishment wash over her" flattening contradiction. Final endurance feels earned via mentor-tied motivation but lacks embodied flaws complicating the peak matching beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density rising from task initiation to blackout edge, delivering Charged Poise closure in surfacing gasp and peace; orientation anchors early (Kaelin, workshop, acid sea). One tightening via vision blurring narrows options with felt oxygen cost, legible in "consciousness begin to blur."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Acid sea and creaking workshop constrain desperation, mirroring internal churn; statue's pockmarks as micro-setting charge task and final accomplishment. Sensory narrowing to stale air and fuzzy vision under breath pressure sharpens pivotal matching moment without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher statue amid drowning risk) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening physiological pressure to "vision growing fuzzy"; agency in persistent matching forecloses escape with collapse cost. Coherent under lens with visible trade-off in ignored workshop sway.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kintsugi theme emerges organically from flawed statue task and mentor memories, resonating in charm's final glint without overt moralizing; subtext of beauty in broken reweights oblivion edge. Minor thematic echo in repeated "conjure meaning" slightly abstracts closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual bias toward alchemical patterns and memories; voice texture poetic yet consistent, modulating rhythm in peak stress compression. No head-hopping; selective noticing (pockmarks over sea) biases effectively under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("creaked and groaned," "quilted together," "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" x3+) create paraphrase churn across beats, dulling density; template cadence in sequential task sentences ("fingers moving... pressed on"). Artifacts touch closure recap, obscuring propulsion despite vivid images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of breath-held alchemy on acid sea with kintsugi statue-map transforms tropes; pockmark-matching as map to universe patterns feels inevitable from flawed relic premise. Risk in dire solo endurance heightens stakes organically.</comment>
