<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies from search to creation, rooted in seer's gifts; interiority poetic but lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene. Final change (seeding reality) earned via stone visions without deep flaws complicating it. Strong embodied emotion in "trembling hand" touch moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from search to visions to reconfiguration, closure as Charged Poise in "magic finally dissipated... created something new" with felt sorrow cost from visions. Single scene oriented early; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (parchment scent, vibrations) guides choices; recurring stone constrains climax touch and charges final image as "testament." Micro-setting (pedestal) pivotal; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock truths via stone) signaled early, tightens via visions urging seed action under Accumulative lens; agency in gesture forecloses prior reality with sorrow cost legible in "pang of sorrow."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of unearthing talents to reshape home emerges organically via visions and final image; resonant non-literal answer in transformed bookstore as "threshold to new possibilities" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (tactile mysticism, e.g., "fingers trailed... vibrations"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity. No dialogue or head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overwriting with figurative density in visions beat ("swirling mists... threads of forgotten memories") dulls propulsion (−0.7); minor synonym loops (profound/deep/mysterious). Rhythm varies but template cadence in descriptive runs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystical tropes via seer-stone-feather arc, but familiar fantasy elements limit boldness; final reconfiguration feels earned from particulars without late rules.</comment>
