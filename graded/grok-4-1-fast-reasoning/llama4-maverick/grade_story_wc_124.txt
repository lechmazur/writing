<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Interiority dominated by diagnostic labels ("aromatically cautious nature," "to understand why some smells triggered") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; wistful traits told not shown through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with sensory/memory density building to CR closure (peace via memory acceptance, vial return as bittersweet reconfiguration); legible cost in fragility realization, but lacks tightening reversal or deepening beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse scents/UV patterns vividly filter through aromatic POV, evolving to mirror transformation; vial as micro-setting charges final image without constraining choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>No coherent pressure or dominant stake escalation under Accumulative lens; abstract grief lacks on-page reversal, narrowing, or visible cost—progression remains static summary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Memory/scent theme emerges via vial reprise and plant vitality, offering non-literal resonance in final shadows; direct articulations ("grasped the impact of memories") dilute subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with selective aromatic perception; rhythmic modulation supports reflection, but repetitive syntax convergence dulls under sustained emotional tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("felt a sense of" variants x5+, "crystal" glow/radiant churn) and template cadence ("As [light/element]..., Elara felt...") across most paragraphs obscure propulsion; artifacts pervade reflective "peak."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lantern broker quirk mildly inflects light focus on familiar nostalgia trope; lacks non-obvious synthesis or risky reconfiguration to transform reflection into fresh premise.</comment>
