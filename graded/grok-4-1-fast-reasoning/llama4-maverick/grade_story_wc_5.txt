<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aria's patience shown concretely through slow weaving of patterns with twigs/pebbles motivates the arc effectively, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; triumph feels earned via embodied focus without deeper internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to plate's glow and pulsing map as Charged Poise RR; orientation anchored immediately in orchard/crater; cost legible in "exhaustion and triumph" and sealed essence at "light faded, the plate lay still."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (damp earth scent, gravel crunch, twilight) reflects alchemist's meditative focus; setting's isolation constrains deliberate slowness, charging final beacon image; recurring stillness/patterns evolve with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (enchantment success) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern completion, hum, glow under lens; agency in sealing channels life force with felt exhaustion cost, narrowing to triumph without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transformation from desolation emerges organically via patterns-from-discards and heartbeat-map; final pulsing plate offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting "withered orchard" into "promise of new beginnings" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature in biased noticing (morbid perfume, etched branches); rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate calm to vibrating anticipation; no dialogue, but diction controlled and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops on "stillness"/"held its breath" (repeated 4x total) and "slowness" create minor redundancy dulling peak glow beat; strong rhythmic variety and density otherwise propel, but artifacts cap high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical heartbeat-maps via starlight/plate transforms trope of isolated creator; risk in "moving stillness" tone heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight at enchanted beacon left behind.</comment>
