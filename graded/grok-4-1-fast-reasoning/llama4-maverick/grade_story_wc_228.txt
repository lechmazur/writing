<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Abstract interiority dominates with stock epiphanies like "sense of freedom"; lacks embodied contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure, especially in cave discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds to Charged Poise closure in legacy image with conceptual cost of disappearance vs. enduring art; abrupt "wrong turn" into oasis creates causality gap without buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid selective details like "luminescent moss" and "rough sand" integrate into action, constrain exploration, and charge final image; POV-filtered painterly bias strengthens specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of capturing "temporary eternity" remains abstract without tightening, reversal, or felt cost under lens; serene creation lacks pressure or narrowed options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Temporary eternity theme emerges from shell, oasis, and legacy images with resonant non-literal close; avoids moralizing but borders overt statement in "symbol of the temporary eternity."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with painterly perceptual signature on light/textures stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation fits accumulative calm-to-profound shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops like repeated "melted away" and "sense of peace settle over her" dull density; template cadence in "vivid colors and textures" across descriptions drags propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Familiar inspirational artist arc with cave discovery not boldly transformed; elements like shell add specificity but lack fresh synthesis or risk.</comment>
