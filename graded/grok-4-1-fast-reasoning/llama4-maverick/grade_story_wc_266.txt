<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Travelers lack interior contradiction or micro-choices under pressure, reading as generic collective; Eira's traits are labeled ("gentle persistence") without embodied conflict. No meaningful change earned through prior causality; group motivation feels declarative. Weak on single-POV baseline despite scope fit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with journey building to Charged Poise at shore ("embarked on the next stage"), cost felt in transformation ahead; orientation anchored early (Eira, ridgeway, twilight). No causal turns or tightening beyond gradual deepening; vignette-like without decisive pressure shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway and mist constrain journey choices vividly; sensory details (swirling mist, shoreline lullaby) selective and POV-filtered through quest urgency. Twilight-to-dawn evolution mirrors internal resolve without overt symbolism. Recurring ridgeway charges final clearing image effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (claim unused courage) signaled early but escalates accumulatively without agency-driven narrowing or felt trade-off; no reversal tests commitment. Shore arrival reweights vaguely under lens, lacking unmistakable cost in pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation via courage emerges organically from journey images, resisting tidy morals; final shore image offers non-literal resonance without statement. Star stamp shifts as commitment symbol. Subtext in mist-clearing lingers plausibly, though lacks deeper ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person atmospheric voice with perceptual bias toward mystical journey; rhythmic prose modulates from hush to resolve without head-hopping. No dialogue to judge. Consistent diction suits lyric mode, perceptual signature in "otherworldly energy."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("footsteps quiet," "gentle persistence" x2, "mist-shrouded") creates paraphrase loops across journey beats, dulling momentum; synonym churn in resolve/determination/purpose. Some overwriting in stacked descriptors ("weight of their quest settling") without density payoff. Rhythm varies but template cadence in traversal sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Allegorical journey tropes (guide to mystical shore) not deeply transformed; familiar hero's path with symbolic stamps/courage lacks non-obvious synthesis. Specific ridgeway/ferry details add mild freshness, but overall hedges toward generic myth without bold risk.</comment>
