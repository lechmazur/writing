<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Consistent motivation to provoke change roots in reverence/rebellion traits, shown via shiver and deep breath before dissemination; embodied emotions (widening eyes, heartbeat sync) contradict via trepidation at closure cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens: thaw→read→disseminate tightens options with realization ("implications of what she held"); Charged Poise closure in final monitoring screens with felt cost ("difficult to control") legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Snow flakes constrain mood and charge final image, mirroring internal disruption; sensory whisper/thicken air filters through Aria's priorities, evolving with transmission.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (provoke via truths) signaled early, tightens agency in dissemination choice narrowing complacency path; cost (trepidation, uncontrollability) unmistakable at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of silenced truths disrupting stasis emerges via letter actions, resonant in final "whispers of the past now mingled"; ambiguity lingers in world change without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (indigo eyes scanning); rhythmic modulation builds to closure poise, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Repetitive snow/eyes/heart/library loops (e.g., snow "in sync with heartbeat" to "continued to fall") create paraphrase churn dulling peak density; some template cadence in descriptive stems.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh cryogenic archivist premise transforms archivist trope into revolutionary via networks; risk in quiet subversion heightens stakes organically.</comment>
