<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Label-only traits like "helix-minded" and "chaotically precise" dominate without embodied micro-choices under pressure; interiority abstracts emotions into epiphanies, e.g., "flood of memories" lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final change feels told via summary rather than earned through struggle. No genuine flaws complicate choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to restored mirror as Conceptual Repricing, cost felt in "losing herself in the labyrinthine corridors"; orientation anchored early in canyon wreckage. One tightening via memory flood narrows to deeper entanglement, but lacks persistent constraint shaping tactics. Closure legible with before/after reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon and mirror micro-setting constrain work and charge final gleaming image; sensory glow and "quaking reverie" selectively mirror internal deepening. Atmosphere tensions reality's reshaping without overt symbolism. Spatial coherence in edge-to-wreckage focus, though professional engineer details shallow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to restore mirror for memories signaled early, but escalation under Accumulative lens minimal—one deepening via unsettling entanglement without narrowing live options or trade-off. Agency passive summary of "worked" without reversal testing commitment. Abstract stakes lack visceral on-page cost beyond told "exhilarating and unsettling."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of entangled memories and abandoned dreams emerges organically via mirror restoration, final purpose as non-literal answer reweighting her reality. Subtext in web-weaving implies complexity without moralizing. Risks pseudo-profundity in phrases like "profound transformation," but particulars avoid tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward patterns, voice texture poetic yet consistent; syntax modulates slightly with intensity. Elevated diction fits helix-minded lens without leakage. Repetitive phrasing like "as she worked" dulls under stress, but no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound, e.g., repeated "connection deepened"/"entwined" across adjacent lines without advancing pressure; template cadence in "As [Elara] [action], [description]" runs dull closure image. Overwriting with stacked metaphors like "quaking reverie reverberate through every molecule" violates logic in high-density beats. Low info density, heavy telling summarizes pivotal assembly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prompt-like synthesis of engineer-memories-mirror feels derivative without transforming tropes via bold specifics; "archeologist of abandoned dreams" hedges into generic mysticism. Freshness in periscope detail, but no risk-taking turn grows from particulars. Emotional truth muffled by abstraction.</comment>
