<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; traits like "kindly decisive nature" told via labels without embodied action, e.g., "asserted itself, and she knew that she must continue."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens with realization as CR, but no legible cost in final hairpin epiphany—"deep sense of contentment wash over her"—fails cost proof test; orientation anchored early, structure fits single-scene default.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration like "rustling leaves, the chirping birds" mirrors internal peace; grotto subtly guides soothing actions, though no constraint on pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>No dominant stake tightening or cost under Accumulative lens; abstract contentment quest lacks on-page test or reversal, static serenity deflates pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rebirth theme emerges via hairpin reprise but relies on telling—"symbol of the eternal cycle"—over implication; final image offers non-literal answer without strong resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward serenity; voice poetic but syntax repetitive, no elision or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops dominate, e.g., repeated "As she worked/thoughts turned" stems and "vineyard hush" churn across paragraphs; template cadence dulls propulsion throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Mystical enlightenment trope with grotto/hairpin untransformed by specific risks; "scallop the clouds" offers minor fresh image but no bold synthesis.</comment>
