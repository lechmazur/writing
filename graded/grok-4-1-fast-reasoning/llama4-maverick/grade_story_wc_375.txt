<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies through drawing process, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; mnemonically gifted trait enables portrait without visible tradeoff or struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase in vibrations/emotions to RR closure (lock transformation with felt emotional cost in "slow uncorking"); orientation anchored early in cave/subject.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystals constrain/inspire drawing choices and charge final image by humming in harmony and sheening the lock; sensory details selective and integrated via POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creative blockage) tightens accumulatively through responsive cave vibrations narrowing to release; agency in drawing forecloses suppression with legible cost in unleashed sorrow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of depths unlocking creativity emerges organically from portrait process and cave resonance; final image reconfigures "auroral sorrow" into peace without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in crystalline filters and emotional rhythm; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in charged closure texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops ("auroral sorrow" reprise and "creativity" unchaining variants) dull mid-drawing density; overwriting in "vibrations...hum in harmony with her own heartbeat" risks artifact without full propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mnemonic artist and responsive crystals transforms creative-block trope; lock's crystalline transformation feels earned in hindsight from cave logic.</comment>
