<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; actions like humming feel declarative rather than pressured micro-choices revealing flaws. Motivation clear but untested, with no embodied contradictions or visible costs in pivotal renewal moment. Passive endurance dominates without earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup from wandering to song-induced visions reconfigures hope with ongoing-task cost legible in "never-ending one." Anchors clear early; single scene coherent. Minor drift in repetitive cycles softens tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mica window as micro-setting constrains visions and charges final image, pulsing energy within her. Sensory details (scents, glows) selective and purposeful, mirroring internal shift. Atmosphere tensions endless night against blooming light effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle realm) signaled but escalates minimally via accumulative stirring; no reversal narrows options or forces trade-off. Plants' response lacks opposition or cost, leaving pressure serene rather than coherent-tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of reconnection emerges organically from song and visions, with final greenhouse-as-beacon image resonating non-literally. Repetitive "woven dawns" borders on overt but ties to particulars. Invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in mystical noticing (shimmering leaves, pulsing vibrations). Rhythmic prose modulates serenely; no head-hopping or elision issues. Voice texture purposeful for lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("memory keeper," "woven dawns," hope motifs) create paraphrase churn across paragraphs, dulling density in buildup. Heavy figurative density (kaleidoscope, swaddle) borders overwriting without mid-beat payoff. Rhythm varies but template stems recur.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lore-gathering fantasy with lyric accumulation transforms memory tropes via mica window and songs. Risky poetic endless-night healing feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes.</comment>
