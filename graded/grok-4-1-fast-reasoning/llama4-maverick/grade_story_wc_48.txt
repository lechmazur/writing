<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority relies on generic stock phrasing like "turmoil that had been brewing inside her" and "fear of failure held her back," lacking concrete, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; epiphanies feel unearned without embodied micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density building to Charged Poise closure in final writing and peace image; orientation anchored early at nexus edge; minor redundancy in reflective beats but cost legible in renewed flow against block.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mist and shell details selectively filter through POV urgency, with shell as micro-setting constraining gaze and charging talisman reprise; sensory swirl (light on curve, hush) mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of creative block signaled early tightens accumulatively via woman cameo deepening subconscious guide, narrowing to writing choice; cost felt in "swimming against the current" endurance, legible in page-spanning realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of subconscious shaping hopes emerges organically from shell/woman motifs shifting to universal voice; final nexus walk reconfigures struggle non-literally; avoids morals but lingers in ambiguity of ongoing journey.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in swirling diction and mist-biased noticing; rhythmic texture modulates from turmoil to hush without head-hopping; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("mist swirling around her" x4, repeated "sense of" feelings); synonym churn in realizations ("calm wash over," "peace settle," "sense of completion"); template cadence in "she felt/she knew" stems dulls propulsion in reflective peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Feral nexus and shell talisman offer fresh mystical angle on writer block, but transforms tropes via hush imagery without bold risk; closure synthesis feels organic yet familiar.</comment>
