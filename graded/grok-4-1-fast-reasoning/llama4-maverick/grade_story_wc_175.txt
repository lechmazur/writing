<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to honor histories is consistent and drives actions like knotting and building, rooted in reverence shown through the moth wing's arrival snapping her eyes open. Interiority feels concrete via embodied peace after final knot, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning toward summary epiphany. Endurance of transience earns closure without deeper flaw complication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from meditative opening to structures and departure, with Charged Poise closure in surveying fragile sentinels before leaving, cost legible in their ephemerality and her clutched wing. Orientation anchored early (grotto, Aria as wanderer). No tightening beyond additive texture; gentle cadence shift suffices but lacks sharp reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (rustle of leaves, sweet scent, insect hum) filters through Aria's priorities, with grotto's mossy stone and clouds constraining material choices for structures. Recurring natural elements like monarch migration charge final suspended animation image. Micro-setting (moth wing on hand) mirrors internal reverence without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring histories amid transience) signaled early via overlooked narratives desire; one deepening via moth wing prompting knotting narrows to creation under fragility pressure. Accumulative escalation via density reweights to Charged Poise, but cost remains abstract (felt reverence) without visceral trade-off. No agency-driven reversal tests commitment sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of transience and memory emerges organically from particulars like fragile structures and glowing moth wing, reweighted in final grotto stillness without moralizing. Subtext in interrupted cadence echoes via insect hum and migration reminder. Resonant non-literal answer in lingering presence ties arc to question of honoring the forgotten.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with nature-biased perceptual signature (e.g., wing as benediction). Prose texture modulates poetically from meditative rhythm to deliberate resolve in rising/surveying. Purposeful compression in lyric mode taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "fragile and beautiful," "testament," "reminder of" across paragraphs dull momentum); synonym churn in reverence/honor phrasing. Overwriting with stacked figuration in high-density descriptive beats (grotto light, wing glow) creates coherence drag without payoff. Template cadence in sentence stems ("As she [action]") triggers −0.6; propulsion suffers despite vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of esoteric realism with natural signals transforms trope of solitary artist into transient memory-honoring via cloud grotto and monarch migration. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes of ephemerality without gimmick. Final image's suspended harmony feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
