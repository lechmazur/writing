<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels like "lilac unease" and "emergent hush" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; final resolution feels unearned amid passive observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from tile flake to mandala climax; charged poise closure lands via lingering unease as conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mist tendrils, tile warmth, and whispering walls constrain perception and charge resolution in lilac light; sensory hierarchy reflects attuned POV without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stake of meaning-in-mess tightens accumulatively via pattern revelations and interjections, forcing endurance; cost legible in persistent unease, though options narrow softly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mandala's evolution offers resonant answer to unlearning theme via image of peace-with-mystery; emerges organically without moralizing, though some platitude risks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable poetic POV with perceptual signature of whispers/patterns; rhythmic modulation suits lyric mode, though minor repetition frays texture under peak intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops ("lilac unease" x3, "emergent hush" x3, "sand mandala was a reflection" x2) and synonym churn create template cadence, dulling closure image and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mandala-tile synthesis transforms mystic introspection freshly; lingers near archetype without bold risk, but particulars like tile warmth add memorable inflection.</comment>
