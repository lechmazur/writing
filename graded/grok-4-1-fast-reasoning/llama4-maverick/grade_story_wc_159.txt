<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in preserving echoes, but lacks contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; interiority poetic yet abstract without embodied conflict, as in "foxglove regret" phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in song's fade and glowing orchids; felt cost legible in "her task was never truly done," reconfiguring endless preservation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (parchment scent, luminescent orbs) filter through caretaker's reverence; recurring glass orchids and chime constrain tending/singing and charge final ethereal glow image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake abstract and static with no tightening, narrowing, or felt trade-off under lens; song moment lacks opposition or cost to pressure, remaining declarative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory's melancholic endurance emerges organically from images without moralizing; final caretaker's shining eyes offer resonant reconfiguration, capped by weak escalation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature in nostalgic noticing; rhythmic prose modulates softly, capped by line-level debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("preserve the sound of forgotten names" x4 exact, "deserted marvels" x3) and metaphor muddle ("velvety softness of foxglove regret") dull propulsion; overwriting pervades song climax without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cloud library, extinct feelings museum, and alchemical song transforms preservation trope; bold lyric risk in deserted marvels feels inevitable at glowing closure.</comment>
