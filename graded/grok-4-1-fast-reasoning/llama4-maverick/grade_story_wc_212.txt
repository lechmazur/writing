<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character motivation clear and rooted in guardianship, intensifying through visions, but interiority relies on abstract epiphanies like "furious tranquility heart guiding her" without embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final realization of passing down the cap feels summarily told rather than earned via micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (vibrations, visions) builds to Charged Poise closure with legible cost in "weight of her responsibility settle upon her shoulders"; single scene anchored early in atrium, one tightening via blowing cap triggering visions, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atrium's thawing frost and starlight vividly integrated, mirroring internal states and charging final image where "starlight twinkled above... infinite possibilities"; selective sensory hierarchy (visual hum, tactile vibrations) reflects POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlocking inheritance signaled early, escalates via vision density under Accumulative lens narrowing to realization/renunciation of burden; cost felt in endurance against overwhelming "kaleidoscope," charging final poise, though no sharp agency reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of balance/cycles emerges organically from past/future visions and egg hatching, resonating in final reweighting without moralizing; pseudo-profundity in "decreasing entropy" line slightly abstracts, but final image offers non-literal answer via "wild serenity."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV with perceptual signature of mystical serenity; rhythmic modulation builds density effectively, purposeful compression in visions legible under Accumulative lens, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in repeated "she felt/she knew" stems across vision beats dull propulsion (-0.6); overwriting with stacked figuration like "kaleidoscope... threatened to overwhelm" in peak without payoff; density strong otherwise, rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed saver mythology with vortex via acorn cap transforms tropes organically; risk in lyric Accumulative structure heightens mystical stakes, core premise non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
