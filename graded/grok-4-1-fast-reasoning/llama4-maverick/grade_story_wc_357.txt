<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent traits drive navigation and discovery, but interiority leans on stock phrases like "stomach drop" and "sense of wonder" without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; realization feels earned yet lacks embodied cost in peak awe at the pool.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from arrow tip to amplified growth to pool realization; CR closure at "echoes were a manifestation... thrive" reconfigures resilience premise with felt awe cost; orientation anchored early in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating rock arches and iridescent pool constrain navigation and charge final image; sensory details like "tendrils curling... ethereal fingers" filter through pilot bias and evolve with inversion; spatial choreography clear through arches to clearing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncover resilience tightens accumulatively via amplified growth trail narrowing to pool; agency in following water flow and landing forces stance crystallization; cost legible in "reluctantly left" and permanent worldview shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Resilience theme emerges organically from growth acceleration to echoes revelation without statement; final pool image offers non-literal reweighting of orchard's "challenging environment"; arrow tip reprise subtly charges subtext of connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pilot-specific details like water flow tactics; rhythmic prose modulates from preparation tension to awe at "whirling silence"; no dialogue, no issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops on "accelerated growth" and "floating rock arches" dull mid-section density; rhythm varies but some stacked modifiers like "glowing, iridescent pool" border overwriting without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inverted-gravity orchards, water-flow navigation, and "gathering of echoes" as energy transforms sci-fi tropes; arrow tip's inexplicable harmony adds non-obvious inflection without gimmickry.</comment>
