<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Interiority relies on diagnostic labels like "turmoil in my mind" and unearned epiphanies such as "motivation shifting" without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; final change feels summarized rather than compelled by micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from detachment to Charged Poise closure in final image of ice expanse and clutched parasol; cost legible in "fragile peace" that acknowledges past surrender; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ice marina vividly filters through POV with sensory selection (cold sting, light dance, mournful sound) mirroring internal fragility; setting constrains isolation-to-engagement choice and charges final image of creaking ice expanse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of post-change purpose signaled early deepens accumulatively via volunteering and sound-hearing; agency in joining work forces endurance with felt cost of "foreign" body; no reversal but cadence shift reweights under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges organically from ice/labor/sound motifs shifting to resilience without direct moralizing; final image offers resonant non-literal answer via wind-whispered healing; minor drift to platitudes like "cherish every moment."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with perceptual signature of loose-gripped, sensory-biased noticing; rhythmic modulation suits reflective intensity; no dialogue, but prose texture distinct in poetic compression without head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Repetitive "sense of" stems ("sense of detachment," "sense of peace," "sense of wonder") create template cadence across reflections; paraphrase loops restate epiphanies without density gain, dulling propulsion in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia revival at icy disaster site transforms second-chance trope through textured labor and "approaching endings" sound; risk in poetic accrual pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
