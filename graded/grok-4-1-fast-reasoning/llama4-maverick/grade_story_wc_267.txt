<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Bellhop's internal conflict on silence feels summarized rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene; epiphanies like "sense of peace" read unearned without micro-choices under pressure. Figure's brief appearance adds no crucible. Final endurance lacks prior causal buildup to compel higher stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via deepening reflections on silence, with Earned Stasis closure as bellhop reconfigures silence from burden to strength ("no longer oppressive"). Minimal tightening via figure's mundane act; static scene lacks motivated ellipsis narrowing options. Orientation anchored early in fortress/staircase.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Snow and fortress evoke palpable stillness, mirroring internal state; discoloration as recurring micro-setting guides perception and charges final gaze as path forward. Sensory focus on cold/quiet purposeful but visually dominant. No constraint on choices, limiting 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of silent guarding pondered but static; figure's piano bolt act offers one textural deepening, reweighting mundanity. Internal pressure coheres accumulatively to stance crystallization, but no live option foreclosed with on-page cost beyond abstract pondering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence's cost emerges organically from vow/regeneration particulars, culminating in resonant CR: final image reweights safety as chosen strength without moral. Subtext in fleeting connection avoids tidy resolution. No direct statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in muted, contemplative diction; rhythmic modulation suits accumulative quietude ("snow continued to fall"). No dialogue. Purposeful poetic compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "silence" burden and snow repetition ("heavy blanket," "blanket of snow") create synonym churn across reflections, dulling density (−1.0); template cadence in repetitive sentence stems ("the bellhop..."). Rhythm varies but overwriting in epiphanies stalls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh surreal synthesis of bellhop/fortress/silent order transforms isolation trope via regeneration motif. Risk in abstract lyricism pays off in charged poise, but familiar contemplative guardian arc limits boldness.</comment>
