<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Abstract interiority relies on labels like "chronologically homesick heart aching" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values; final "sense of purpose" feels unearned epiphany rather than compelled by prior pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in final image of resolve amid frozen lake's breath-held anticipation; nostalgic burden as felt cost legible in "burden and a blessing"; orientation anchored early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (dawn light facets, crisp air) integrate purposefully, with glass spire and mirrored horizon constraining inspiration and charging final shimmering whole; POV bias shapes noticing of symmetry over other elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reigniting spark via mapping signals early but escalates minimally via textural quickening ("pace quickened, movements fluid"); cost of nostalgia felt but lacks agency-driven narrowing of options before exhaustion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of creativity from stillness/symmetry emerges organically through recurring reflection images shifting to aspirations' promise; final blended horizon offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with perceptual signature in poetic noticing (e.g., "topography of memories"); purposeful compression taught early, but minor register elevation into abstract diction under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops ("mirrored horizon/symmetry" repeated across sentences) and template cadence ("As the [light/sun], the writer [moved]") dull propulsion; figurative overwriting like "upturned hush" muddles clarity in build beats without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune cookie writer with symphonic nostalgia transforms trope via specific images, but risks contrived poeticism; final reconfiguration feels earned from particulars without late rules.</comment>
