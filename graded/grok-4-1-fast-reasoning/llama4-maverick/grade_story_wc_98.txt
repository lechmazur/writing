<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Aria's doubt creates mild internal tension, but contradictory impulses lack embodiment in micro-choices under urgency; conviction shift feels summarized in final lines rather than earned through scene actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure—Aria's vanishing reconfigures her guardianship with conceptual cost of physical loss—but misses one clear tightening reversal, relying on time passage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Blooming ridge and sprouting seed constrain nurturing actions and charge final image of thriving memory; sensory details evolve purposefully, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Monsoon deadline signals dominant stake early with accumulative escalation via deepening discoveries, but lacks on-page reversal testing commitment; cost legible in time pressure and vanishing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of preservation through whimsical doubt emerges organically from seed-to-sapling arc; final rains offer resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting prior uncertainty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with whimsical perceptual signature filtering nature motifs; rhythmic prose modulates from serene to urgent, consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops (e.g., "collective memory" variants, blooming echoes) create minor paraphrase drag across descriptions, dulling propulsion despite purposeful texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Empirically whimsical" trait transforms memory preservation into fresh, grounded fantasy synthesis; vanishing payoff feels inevitable from ridge symbiosis.</comment>
