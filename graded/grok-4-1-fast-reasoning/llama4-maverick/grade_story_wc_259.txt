<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Historian's curiosity drives passive observation without contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; transformation in "forever changed" feels unearned by prior scene actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from tomes to pagoda vision to CR closure, reweighting perception with "anguished joy" cost in final paragraphs; single scene coherent, orientation early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Archive's "scent of aged parchment" and pagoda facets constrain gaze and charge departing memory image; sensory details selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stake of forbidden knowledge deepens accumulatively via pagoda gaze but lacks agency-driven reversal; cost in irrevocable change legible but passively received.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Nostalgia atoms and pagoda vision yield resonant theme of transformative pursuit without statements; final image reweights knowledge quest non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Close single POV stable with biased noticing of mystical details; rhythmic prose like "river meandering through the landscape of her soul" distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Multiple "anguished joy" recurrences and paraphrase loops in reflections create redundancy; rhythm varies but density suffers in peak visionary beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Atoms of nostalgia" and pagoda synthesize fresh textural mysticism on knowledge trope; poetic risk coherent without gimmickry.</comment>
