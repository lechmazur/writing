<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and consistent but static, lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; no micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority relies on stock phrasing like "pang of longing" without particular embodiment. Final endurance feels declarative rather than earned through causal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via weaving process to Charged Poise closure where tapestry glows, reconfiguring ruin to reverence with felt burden ("weight of her task"). Orientation anchored early in labyrinth/canyon. One tightening via fabric glowing on its own suffices; cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Labyrinth as recurring micro-setting reflects inner maze, constraining solace-seeking and charging final glow. Sensory details (damp earth, whispers, fading light) selective and POV-biased toward poetic meditation. Integrates via "twisted tunnels... reflection of Aria's own inner world," mirroring transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weave hope from fragments) signaled early but pressure static under Accumulative lens; single deepening (fabric glows independently) narrows options minimally without trade-off. No opposition or reversal tests commitment. Cost abstract ("burden of creating") rather than viscerally felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of art remaking ruin emerges via particulars but undermined by overt statements like "testament to the power of art to transform" in final paragraphs, triggering thematic echo penalty. Final image offers non-literal resonance but lingers in platitude. Subtext implicit in weave's emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with poetic perceptual signature (needles "dancing," threads "weaving together... of its own accord"). Voice modulates slightly with intensity but drifts to elevated diction. No head-hopping or withholding; compression purposeful in lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn (e.g., repeated "weave/fabric/threads/tapestry," "ruin to reverence/hauntingly optimistic/orchid solace" across final third dull closure image); template cadence in "As she [action], Aria's thoughts..." runs. Figurative density overwrites without payoff in peak completion beat. −1.7 artifact cap applies as flaws touch ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic weaver transforming labyrinth via art, but tropes (inner maze, glowing creation as hope beacon) untransformed by bold specifics. "Wharf weaver" in canyon adds quirky inflection but underused. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
