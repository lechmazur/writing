<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Interiority relies on repetitive, abstract feelings like "felt the webs... vibrate" without contradictory impulses acting in scene; motivation clear but lacks micro-choices under pressure revealing flaws; no embodied conflict or visible cost in Aria's endurance beyond poetic assertion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in "she had taken a step closer... journey far from over," reweighting quest with ongoing conceptual cost; single scene oriented early; lacks tightening reversal but one deepening revelation suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Shell as micro-setting handled tactilely, warms and merges in song beat, charges final image "still warm... waiting for her next song"; sensory hierarchy (ears, hums) purposeful; vivid integration without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn why echoes) signaled early but escalation abstract—revelation via "progressive disclosure" deepens knowledge without narrowing options or visible trade-off; low pressure, no agency test beyond singing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of echoes/relationships emerges organically through song-weaving particulars; final image "reed-blown melancholy... echoing within her" offers resonant CR without moralizing; ambiguity in ongoing mystery lingers effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice consistent with perceptual signature (whispers, hums); rhythmic modulation suits melancholy tone; stable single POV, no head-hopping; Q7 debt caps higher potential.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound ("song wove... voice weaving," "echoes stirring... heard a voice"); template cadence in "As she sang... As the night wore on"; synonym churn (whispers/song/voice/hum) dulls closure image; overwriting obscures propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fantasy lyricism transforms echo quest into textural revelation; shell-webs synthesis fresh; risks poetic density without gimmick, heightens stakes through ongoing mystery.</comment>
