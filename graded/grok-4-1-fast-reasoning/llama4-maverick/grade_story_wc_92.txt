<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Sentinel's motivation shifts abruptly to revolution without contradictory impulses or embodied tension; "calmly inventive mind quickly grasped" is label-only, lacking micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under guard duty pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds via blackout → sound → sundial decipher → activation DC, with legible cost in "road ahead... fraught with danger"; orientation anchored early, but redundant resolution beats ("transformed, infused") dilute tightening past midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Darkness, shadows, and glow integrate selectively via POV urgency, constraining perception during intrigue; fort generic beyond "ancient structures," sundial charges decipher moment but lacks proportional evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guard cradle vs. revolution) signaled early, tightens via code recognition narrowing options; agency in activation forecloses duty path, but abstract "surge of determination" leaves escalation under lens short of 8-band trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Revolution theme emerges via particulars like quill/sundial, final glow reconfigures darkness-to-light; direct assertions ("new era of freedom and creativity") reduce subtext, resolving to tidy binary without lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (straining eyes, grasping code); rhythmic texture poetic but monotones under stress; no dialogue, elision minimal and legible under causal lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("silent revolution," "new era," "infused with... purpose" x4+ in finale) and template cadence ("as the sentinel... she knew") dull closure image; overwriting with stacked modifiers obscures propulsion in peak reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Coded sundial and quill as revolution keys offer fresh synthesis on conspiracy trope; cradle activation turn earned in hindsight, but premise hedges via generic fantasy uplift without bold risk to stakes.</comment>
