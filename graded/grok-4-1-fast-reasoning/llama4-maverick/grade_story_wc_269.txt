<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority abstract and repetitive ("periodically eternal," nagging curiosity) with no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; motivation consistent but lacks micro-choices under pressure revealing values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from observations to map to CR closure; "truth...in the rhythms of the sea itself" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of hidden secrets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Station, ocean, and logbooks vividly constrain choices like map assembly; atlas and drum as recurring objects charge final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (disappearing paths) deepens accumulatively via logbooks and map, but escalation lacks sharp option-narrowing or trade-off; cost felt obliquely in lingering mystery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of rhythms revealing/veiling ocean truths emerges from particulars like tapping and map; final drumming offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature tuned to sea sounds/rhythms; rhythmic syntax purposeful, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("secrets," "rhythms," "observations") and paraphrase redundancy (e.g., nagging absence to whispering page) across reflections dull density; some template cadence in "Maya [action]" stems.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh post-fossil ban eco-reflection via drum-tapping as sea-listening transforms standard environmentalism; risks lyric accumulation effectively.</comment>
