<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Interiority relies on diagnostic labels like "map emotional terrain" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; picking the screw offers minor revelation but no simultaneous impulses acting in scene to earn change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early orientation in shop/fog; CR closure lands in final fog image reweighting loss with persistent cost of anosmia, though thin on decisive tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Screw and fog constrain perception and charge ending reprise; sensory hierarchy (no smell, focus on sound/light) reflects POV bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Internal stake (loss vs. revelation) signaled early but lacks meaningful tightening under lens; screw beat deepens softly without narrowing options or agency-driven cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of occluded meaning emerges via screw/fog particulars to resonant CR; avoids overt moralizing until near-end "deeper truths" nudge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (muted senses amid calm); rhythmic texture modulates but drifts to abstract register in reflections.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound (e.g., repeated "hidden patterns/connections" across paragraphs); synonym churn ("ordinary miracles," "deeper truths") dulls density in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of anosmic aromatherapist, birthing screw in clock shop transforms sensory epiphany trope through quirky objects charging closure.</comment>
