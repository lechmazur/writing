<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in stifling certainty intensifies compellingly to mirror-arranging agency; embodied interiority shines in nickel pulsing against skin. Minor epiphanic summary at "exchanged certainty for curiosity" slightly abstracts the shift without touching closure cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sound/color density crescendos to feedback vortex tightening stake; RR closure via live mural reconfigures worldview with legible cost in crumbling certainty. Single scene anchors orientation early; one decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sound wave garden constrains pivotal choice via mirrors/sculpture interplay; recurring nickel/mural charge final image. Sensory hierarchy (vibrations on skin, deepening colors) reflects POV urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs. curiosity) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via mirror feedback narrowing options to personal unraveling; agency in arrangement forces trade-off with felt cost in "certainty crumbling." Climax maelstrom tests commitment visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity over certainty emerges organically from mural's revival mirroring internal kaleidoscope; final pulsing image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in humming tunes, vibrating air; rhythmic modulation builds to lyrical crescendo. No dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density in sensory propulsion, but mild paraphrase loops on "sound waves" (e.g., vibrate, hum, pulse) and "seemed" repetitions dull peak vortex slightly without obscuring closure. Rhythm varies read-aloud; no major artifacts touch ending image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sound-reactive pigments and mirror feedback synthesize fresh magical realism from garden logic; hobo nickel reprise transforms token into guiding constraint heightening stakes organically.</comment>
