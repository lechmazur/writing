<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Progression from crestfallen staring to purposeful untangling earns perceptual shift, with embodied actions like "fingers moved with a newfound purpose"; mild abstract epiphanies ("fragments... intertwined") border unearned but tie to prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of realizations tightens from fractured box/mind to "threads... flowed through her like a river"; Charged Poise closure lands on-page with legible cost in "descent into the necessary darkness within."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lighthouse beam and library labyrinth constrain internal navigation and charge final image ("lighthouse... cast its light upon the path"); sensory selectivity like "scent of aged paper" mirrors urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of crestfallen fragmentation deepens accumulatively via untangling beat narrowing to intertwined perception; agency in methodical work forecloses disjointed view with felt soul-descent cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of art transforming fragments emerges organically via box/threads progression to "darkness... a beginning"; repeated "luminescent ache" nears explicit echo, slightly undercutting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with patterned diction ("whispers," "hum") delivers distinct perceptual signature biased toward hidden patterns; stable close-POV modulates rhythmically without drift under introspective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops restate realization ("fragments... intertwined," "threads... flowed") across final third, with synonym churn ("tangled/untangled," "darkness" x6) and repetitive "luminescent ache" (x4) dulling closure propulsion; overwriting figurative density lacks rhythm variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tarot box untangling in lighthouse-library synthesizes artist crisis freshly, transforming fragmentation trope via specific method and perceptual redesign; risks lyric density heighten stakes without gimmick.</comment>
