<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation to transform scars clear but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; interiority poetic yet generic, with epiphanies like "overwhelming urge to shed the weight" told rather than embodied in micro-choices under tremors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise in sunset and spent quill; cost legible as "weight of his past slowly lifting" reconfigures stance with felt emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory details like "faint scent of sandalwood" and platform tremors selectively constrain focus and mirror internal shift; recurring quill charges final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rune deciphering/transforming past tightens via held breath to rune whispers surge; escalation accumulative but tremors as external pressure underutilized without narrowing options further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of stillness yielding power emerges organically through held breath and scars-to-stories; final sunset parting storms offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature biased toward mystical forces in scents and whispers; rhythmic prose modulates from calm to flow-state inspiration without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("stillness" x4, "tranquility" variants in final third) create paraphrase churn dulling propulsion; figurative density overwrites writing beat with "saturated hush" echoes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh fantasy synthesis of tea ceremony on drifting platform with rune whispers; lyric accumulative form risks poetic stasis but heightens internal transformation organically.</comment>
