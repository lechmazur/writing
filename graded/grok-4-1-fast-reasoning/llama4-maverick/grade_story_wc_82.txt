<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation to transform grief is consistent and embodied in crafting lanterns and cranes, with contradictory solace/torment impulses shown through actions like rising at sunset. Final endurance of creating amid loss feels earned via prior micro-choices. Minor weakness: interiority veers toward poetic abstraction over fully particular flaws in pivotal release moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from crafting to basilica longing and crane release as Charged Poise RR, reconfiguring grief with felt emotional cost in "grief begin to unfold, like the petals of a lotus." Single scene fits scope; orientation anchored early. Thin beats limit causality tightening to one deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating island tea garden vividly filters through Kaito's crafty priorities, with lanterns' glow and misty depths mirroring internal ascent/descent. Basilica glints constrain longing without overt symbolism. Sensory selection purposeful, evolving to lanterns whispering at close.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of grief transformation signaled early via lanterns/cranes; one accumulative deepening in crane release narrows to endurance under torment, with cost in poignant longing felt on-page. Internal conflict coheres but lacks agency-driven reversal beyond reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of art as grief balm emerges organically from particulars like crane and lanterns, culminating in resonant final image of unfolding lotus without moralizing. Subtext in luminous torment layers complexity. No tidy resolution; ambiguity lingers in basilica beckon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct lyrical perceptual signature biased to light/glass motifs. Voice modulates rhythmically from work hum to evening release. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression taught early fits lens without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("transform...shape and mold," "luminous torment" repeated 4x) and overwriting with metaphors in every sentence dull propulsion, especially in crafting beats. Template cadence in "his hands moved...shaping, molding" across paragraphs. Closure image muddled by redundancy; density low.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of floating isles, lantern craft, and origami grief transformation feels organic and inevitable, with crane release as bold inflection reweighting loss. Tropes like dream arts subverted through personal torment without gimmickry.</comment>
