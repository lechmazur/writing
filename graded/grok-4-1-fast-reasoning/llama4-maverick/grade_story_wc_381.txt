<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>No internal conflict or contradictory impulses; summoner remains serene archetype without flaws complicating choices or embodied stress degrading perception, as in the tireless work amid deepening trance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase in silence and meditative deepening to Charged Poise RR at wing release; on-page cost legible in energy poured and prophecy hushed, satisfying closure with orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (brook flow, leaf rustle, flower scent) integrate purposefully, with origami wing and brook constraining release choice and charging final drift image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled but remains abstract without visceral pressure or agency-driven tightening; minimal escalation via silence growth fails to foreclose live options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of silence's power emerges organically from meditative weaving and wing release; final image offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature (vibrations, ethereal glow); rhythmic modulation suits trance intensity, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("tranquil" variants, "gentle rustle of leaves" repeat, silence/hush churn) and template cadence in descriptions pervade, dulling propulsion and touching closure wing drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami ritual "mapping silence" to hush coded prophecy transforms mystical trope through specific "terrestrially cosmic" method and tranquil blaze tone.</comment>
