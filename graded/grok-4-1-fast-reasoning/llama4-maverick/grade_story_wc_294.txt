<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear via backstory but lacks intensifying pressure or contradictory impulses in scene; realization feels unearned epiphany rather than micro-choices under stress. Perceptively calm trait shown in observations but label-heavy without embodied tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with observations building to Conceptual Repricing closure; cost legible in "lingering sense of disillusionment" reconfigured as peace. Single scene anchored early; one tightening via realization suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (scent of decay, lion's den outline) filter through POV and mirror internal growth; train setting subtly guides discoveries like money. Recurring dusky sky charges final image without constraining pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding circuitous paths) signaled but static; no on-page reversal, deepening, or narrowing under lens—realization lacks agency-driven escalation or visible price in key beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of journeys via markers/stories emerges organically but undermined by explicit statements like "the value of a journey lay not in its destination"; final image resonates yet borders moralizing echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in calm, detailed noticing; rhythmic prose modulates reflectively but repetitive phrasing ("polished calm") erodes distinction under sustained introspection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound (e.g., repeated "Kael realized," "understood" in closing beats dull closure image); template cadence in reflective sentences ("Kael's [trait] allowed him to [notice]") triggers −0.6; overwriting with redundant harmony motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of robber lineage, startup failure, and circus relics into path-metaphor feels organic; transforms abandoned-place trope via territorial markers but risks safety-middle reflection without bold turns.</comment>
