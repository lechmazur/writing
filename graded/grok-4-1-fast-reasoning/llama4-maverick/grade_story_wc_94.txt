<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Abstract interiority relies on diagnostic labels like "storm-kissed wonder" and unembodied epiphanies, e.g., "sense of understanding wash over her," diluting contradictory impulses and micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing at envelope-reading, where confronting hidden truths incurs legible emotional cost; one tightening via inspiration suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory and recurring timer constrain the vigil's isolation and charge the final image of ticking reminder amid dissipating turbulence, with sensory selectivity mirroring internal priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of scar-mapping tightens accumulatively through inward thoughts to envelope climax, forcing confrontation with visible cost in mask-slipping; agency in opening reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of scars' cartography emerges organically from storm/scars/timer interplay, with final image offering non-literal reconfiguration of turmoil into awe without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Poetic perceptual signature with biased pattern-seeking is stable in single POV, modulating rhythmically; cap applied due to Q7 heavy debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops restate storm turmoil and scar-mapping (e.g., multiple "cartography of scars," "storm raged"); figurative density in every sentence dulls propulsion without pattern payoff, touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of censored poet's timer/timetable relics amid storm transforms introspection vignette; specific objects heighten stakes organically.</comment>
