<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to infuse memories into dishes compels planting the seed as a credible endurance with felt cost against decay, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, relying on harmonious labels like "gentle reverence."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from pruning to alignment peak, landing Charged Poise closure in the sprouting seed reconfiguring ruins into rebirth; cost legible in "potential for rebirth" image amid decay, with early anchoring of who/where/when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse and overgrown vines constrain pruning and planting choices while charging the final sprout image; sensory details like "ethereal light" and "vibrated... hush" filter through Aria's priorities, evolving causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to create beauty from ruins signals early and tightens accumulatively via alignment stirring memories, narrowing to dish presentation; agency in nurturing seed forces trade-off with decay, though pressure remains serene without sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth from decay emerges organically through seed's evolution from peculiar find to symbolic sprout, offering resonant non-literal answer in final image without moralizing; particulars like memory-infused soil avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias toward flavors/memories; rhythmic prose modulates serenely, but lacks distinct compression under peak alignment stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops like repeated "gentle rebellion" and "memories lingered" across adjacent lines dull propulsion in mid-section buildup; overwriting with stacked metaphors ("testament to forgotten dreams... shrouded in a tangle of vines and memories") reduces density in key beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting chef and knowledge fruit under celestial alignment transforms decay trope into inevitable lyrical rebirth; risk in synaptic plasticity tie elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
