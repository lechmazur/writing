<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Statue's incisively kind nature is label-only without embodied tradeoffs or contradictory impulses acting in scene; realizations like "testament to the power of adaptability" feel unearned and tidy. Parrotfish adds minor pressure via vision-sharing, but no micro-choices reveal value hierarchy with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with revelation density tightening to CR closure: "sense of peace settle over it, as if it had finally welcomed nuance into a certainty that had long been held," with conceptual cost of lost certainty legible on-page. Orientation anchors immediately in underwater garden; single scene fits defaults without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selective sensory details like "scales shimmering in the dim light" and current delivering ampoule integrate into action, evolving from decay to vibrant life and charging final image with empty ampoule at feet. Setting subtly guides choices via drift and pedestal perch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of garden understanding deepens via ampoule cascade under accumulative lens, narrowing to perceptual shift, but low opposition leaves pressure internal and abstract. Statue's agency in catching and sharing shows one tightening with foreclosed certainty as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of nuance/resilience emerges organically from decay-to-vibrancy shift via particulars like structural weaknesses and beauty in adaptation. Final image of empty ampoule offers resonant CR without overt moral, though repeated "testament" edges toward echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited POV stable with perceptual signature in telepathic whispers and "stone eyes gazing"; rhythmic syntax modulates wonder effectively. No dialogue; purposeful compression in revelations legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops like repeated "forgotten underwater city garden," "thread together fragments," and "vibrant, thriving ecosystem" in final third dull closure image; synonym churn on revelations/reinsights creates template cadence. Density low with redundant stems obscuring propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic statue animating decay via ampoule revelations transforms renewal tropes through underwater decay-beauty pivot. Risky accumulative lyricism heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
