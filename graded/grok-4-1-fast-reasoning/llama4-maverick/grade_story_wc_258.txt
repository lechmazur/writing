<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Label-only traits like "steadily curious" dominate without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; no internal conflict or earned change, all affirming summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of measurements and reflections builds to charged poise closure in "map to a hidden treasure"; orientation anchored early, cost felt in dedication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rain drumming and skylight glow evolve tactilely, constraining immersion; measuring tape as micro-setting charges final pocketed symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>No reversal or deepening narrows options under accumulative lens; abstract stakes like "uncover hidden dynamics" lack on-page pressure or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Emergent theme of patterns bridging chaos and destiny resonates via cards "confiding" and generational link; final tape pockets non-literal continuity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature on geometry/mystery; rhythmic texture modulates build, purposeful lyric compression legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops restate immersion ("felt a sense of purpose... conduit for patterns"); repetitive "cartomancer" stems and synonym churn for curiosity dull density throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Post-crash cartomancy reverse-engineered via tape precision transforms divination trope organically; synthesis of crypto chaos and inherited craft feels inevitable.</comment>
