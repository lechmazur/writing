<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Motivation to thread labyrinth told repetitively without contradictory impulses or micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values; no earned change or embodied emotion under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens with density buildup via motifs; conceptual repricing closure in "story unfolding... tale of mystery and wonder" reconfigures legacy, but lacks decisive pattern break or tightening with legible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lattice and scuffs vividly constrain perception and guide choices, e.g., "casting a copperlight repose" charges exploration and final glow image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering/threading story abstract, no reversal, deepening, or cadence shift under accumulative lens to narrow options or make cost visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of inheriting stories emerges via thread/whisper motifs; final image offers resonant non-literal answer to legacy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct poetic perceptual signature in diction like "copperlight repose"; minor syntactic repetition under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops ("thread the labyrinth" x4, "whispers"/"hush"/"secrets" churn) and template cadence dull propulsion; artifacts touch closure image repetition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cry-wolf legacy into labyrinthine gothic poetry transforms tropes organically.</comment>
