<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation to thaw mistrust via transparency is clear and consistent, but lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; realizations feel summarized without embodied conflict, as in repetitive "sense of resolve/clarity" blocks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of clarity images building to Charged Poise CR at lens-to-eye moment, where world transforms with felt cost of melted secrecy; one tightening via doodle deciphering suffices, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (wet stone scent, echoing footsteps, resonant hush) mirror internal thaw and guide path to monolith; lens as recurring micro-setting constrains final choice and charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake of transparency signaled early deepens accumulatively through ticket and lens beats, narrowing to realization with abstract emotional cost; lacks visceral price or trade-off at pivotal lens raise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of honesty freeing via transparency emerges organically from rain-wash, doodle-whispers, lens-clarity progression; final image reconfiguration offers resonant non-literal answer without overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close POV stable with perceptual signature biased toward secretive clarity (whispers, ambiguous glass); rhythmic hush texture modulates introspection effectively, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("mistrust and secrecy melted away," repeated realizations) and synonym churn (clarity/transparency/honesty) create template cadence across reflective beats, dulling propulsion; obscures closure image density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of projector lens, cryptic ticket doodles, and crystal forecourt transforms introspective transparency trope into inevitable CR; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes organically.</comment>
