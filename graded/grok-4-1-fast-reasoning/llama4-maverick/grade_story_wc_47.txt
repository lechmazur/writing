<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions like heart pounding and peace washing over during pattern moment, but diagnostic labels ("quietly proactive") and tidy epiphany in final paragraphs reduce contradictory impulses and character-particular interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from wandering to flower proffer and walking out; Charged Poise closure reconfigures vulnerability with legible grafted-pain cost in "new chapter unfolding" image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moss garden micro-setting (vines on servers, soft earth, icicle pattern) constrains healing choices (kneeling prompts encounter) and charges final sunlight step-out; sensory hierarchy sharpens POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Textural deepening via flower proffer narrows isolation options, but dominant post-confession stake stays abstract without visceral on-page test or trade-off tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Resilient transformation emerges organically from pendant/garden images, but final-paragraph summary ("strength she had found in vulnerability") borders thematic echo, softening resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in nature-biased noticing (honeyed hush, moss floor); rhythmic modulation fits quiet intensity without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("sense of peace/healing" cluster in final third) dull closure propulsion; strong sensory density elsewhere, but repetition caps high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh abandoned data center as healing sanctuary transforms viral-confession trope; garden-figure synthesis feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
