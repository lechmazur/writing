<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent (restore balance via craft), but no contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; serene competence lacks embodied conflict or flaws complicating the climax repair. Interiority poetic but abstract, not character-particular under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to RR closure (box sings, chip dims as felt cost in final image); single scene oriented early, one tightening at "moment of truth" narrows to decisive turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Resonance chamber vividly sensory and purposeful, filtering through Erebus's priorities; chip as recurring micro-setting constrains guidance and charges final dimming image, mirroring internal restoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair unbroken box) signaled early with accumulative deepening to climax, but minimal opposition or reversal; cost (chip dims) legible yet pressure remains serene without narrowing live options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming light via "mending what isn't torn" emerges organically from particulars, culminating in resonant final image without moralizing; subtext in covenant/rusts adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (mystical tinkering lens); rhythmic prose modulates effectively, voice consistent and biased toward hidden harmonies.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but minor paraphrase loops ("light stolen by midnight," balance motifs) and heavy figuration slightly dull peak clarity without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical repairman trope with "covenant of rust" and philosopher's chip transforms fantasy craft into resonant balance quest; risk in poetic lyricism heightens without gimmick.</comment>
