<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Advisor's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and consistent but lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; traits like "quietly charismatic" are labeled rather than revealed through conflicting actions. Old man's signing provides secondary pressure but no status shift or relational crucible. Final nod and weaving feel poetic but unearned without prior internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from observation to signing to symphony, culminating in Charged Poise RR where harbor transforms and advisor vanishes, reweighting memory with conceptual cost in "music remains." Orientation anchored early in harbor/moonlight. Single tightening via crowd gathering suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Moonlight and waves provide vivid, selective sensory grounding that evolves with music, mirroring internal states and charging final image. Harbor subtly guides gathering and transformation without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clear around stall; recurring moonlight constrains atmospheric tuning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating silence emerges early but remains abstract, with accumulative escalation via signing and crescendo lacking visceral cost or narrowed options. No reversal tests commitment; harmonious progression avoids trade-offs. Joy/sorrow hints at price but feels declarative, not dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of voicing the unheard emerges organically from signing, camera, and symphony, with final image repricing forgetfulness via enduring music. Subtext in silence/sound bridge invites ambiguity without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with lyrical perceptual signature biased toward unspoken rhythms; rhythm modulates poetically. Signing treated as goal-driven "dialogue" with subtext. No head-hopping; diction purposeful and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("luminous harbor by moonlight," "whispers of the past," "joyful sorrow") creates paraphrase loops and template cadence across paragraphs, dulling density. Some overwriting with stacked metaphors in build-up; rhythm varies but scaffold drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sign language, empty camera, and silence-to-music transforms memory tropes into lyrical premise. Bold accumulative lyricism risks poetic drift but coheres. Final vanishing offers earned, non-obvious reconfiguration.</comment>
