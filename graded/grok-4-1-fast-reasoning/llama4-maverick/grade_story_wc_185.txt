<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Generic interiority with stock phrasing like "deep motivation" and no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; no embodied emotions or flaws complicating the passive success at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from din to hush via ice study; on-page RR closure in "bloom of hush began to take hold" with felt persistence cost, but minimal tightening narrows no options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ice crack patterns and stone constrain observation choices, mirroring internal stress and charging final luminosity image; selective sensory vibrations vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early, but no agency-driven reversal or deepening under Accumulative lens; passive energy being shift deflates pressure without trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Harmony-in-chaos theme emerges organically from vibration shifts and final reconfiguration image; resonant without moralizing, though lacks competing goods.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in harmonic noticing; rhythmic texture modulates effectively, no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn on "vibrations," "harmony," "mapkeeper" across beats dull propulsion; template cadence in repetitive summaries like cave state recaps obscures density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vibrational ecology and hush bloom transforms disruption trope; world logic feels organic and risks bold resonance mechanics.</comment>
