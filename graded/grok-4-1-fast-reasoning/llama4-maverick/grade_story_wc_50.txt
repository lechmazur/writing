<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong consistent motivation rooted in curiosity drives the painstaking work to closure, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for deeper interior conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of study tightening to resonant reconfiguration at "final, satisfying click" where device whirs alive, cost of months' effort legible; orientation anchored early in cavern approach.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Luminescent crystals as recurring micro-setting constrain reverse-engineering method and charge final approving glow, filtering through Elian's attuned perception; sensory hierarchy sharpens with damp earth and echoes mirroring internal attunement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlocking echoes via device repair signaled early with textural accumulation over time, but lacks reversal or deepening narrowing live options beyond steady endurance; cost felt in effort but pressure remains meditative without agency test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of storing wonder in reason emerges organically from study to final heartbeat-sync image reweighting echoes' magic without moralizing; resonant non-literal closure avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of peripheral attunement and rhythmic lyricism modulates effectively; purposeful poetic compression taught early remains legible to charged poise ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive "As he..." stems and paraphrase loops in study beats ("understanding grew...appreciation for intricate beauty") create template cadence dulling propulsion; overwrites minor but density dips mid-section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith tinkering echoes in metaphorical cavern transforms trope of discovery into cellar-of-reason storage; wounded season and harvest concept feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
