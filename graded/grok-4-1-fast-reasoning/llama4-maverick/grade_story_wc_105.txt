<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority via synesthesia tying colors to sounds, rooted in mother's voice memory; motivation consistent and intensifies via collected absences. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or genuine struggle in micro-choices during calibration; success feels competent but unpressured. No blind spots compounding before imprinting climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tinkering to imprinting with cadence shift at "device hummed to life." Orientation anchored early in greenhouse/forge. Closure as Charged Poise RR via fragile sound's resonance and forward vision, with felt ongoing cost in "work was far from over"; one tightening via memory drift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration through POV bias (creaking as rusty red groan); aurora/shipwrecks subtly mirror ethereal work. Forge constrains as key to unlocking sound, charging final fade. Selective, purposeful details evolve with night, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (imprint trust-breaking sound) signaled early but lacks tightening or reversal; no live option foreclosed or agency-tested complication. Pressure abstract/emotional, not viscerally narrowed; smooth success without cost-legible trade-off at imprinting climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of memories healing via sound/color absences emerges organically from particulars like mother's golden voice fading. Final image reconfigures trust-breaking as growth catalyst without moralizing. Resonance from synesthesia particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (colors as murmurs/groans); voice modulates poetically for synesthesia without filter excess. Rhythmic control in aurora dance; no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., forge whispers counterpoint colors); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor paraphrase loops in "sound of trust breaking" repeats and memory drifts dull propulsion slightly; no heavy artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synesthesia-crafting premise transforms healing trope via absences/silences in surreal setting; forge/aurora synthesis feels inevitable. Risky perceptual voice heightens stakes organically, no derivatives.</comment>
