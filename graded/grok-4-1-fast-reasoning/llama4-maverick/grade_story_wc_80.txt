<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Characterization leans on labels like "stoically sensitive" and "hushed blaze" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; motivation told via summary ("dedicated their life") rather than dramatized in pivotal retrieval of inkwell. No internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from inkwell discovery to final departure image; closure as Charged Poise/CR in "wrestled a piece of the past into the present," reweighting absence with conceptual cost legible in left-behind inkwell. Orientation anchored early; no shard violations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (murky waters, silt, orange glow, drawbridge echo) integrate via POV-filtered action; pavilion and inkwell as micro-settings constrain retrieval and charge final image of "empty, yet full of stories."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wrest stories from silence) signaled early but escalates mildly via inkwell-deepened absence; no live option foreclosed or trade-off in accumulative lens, leaving pressure abstract without on-page cost beyond felt reverence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of absence's beauty emerges via inkwell and notes, resonating in final "beacon in the void"; overt echoes like "testament to the power of interlaced absence" border thematic statement, diluting subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (whispers of past, hushed blaze rhythm); lyrical diction modulates effectively from stoic survey to reverent close without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn on "stories," "absence," "past" (e.g., repeated "testament," "relic") across reflections dull density; template cadence in declarative sentences like "The surveyor's task was not..." pervades, obscuring propulsion in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveyor as "archeologist of abandoned dreams" with notes-in-foundations method transforms relic-hunting trope; "interlaced absence" and inkwell reprise feel organic, though poetic mode familiar.</comment>
