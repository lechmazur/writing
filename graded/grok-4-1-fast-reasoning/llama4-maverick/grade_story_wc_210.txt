<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear in rejecting sentimentality for reimagination, but interiority relies on summary ("mind consumed by the task," "thoughts turned") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal contemplation; micro-choices lack embodied pressure, flattening change to action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from memory reconstruction to vision shaping and town stirring; closure as Charged Poise RR lands on-page ("the town began to transform around them") with felt cost of dedication, but thin tightening weakens causal heft in dawn rising beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (scent of decay, writhing patterns, lanterns brightening) integrates purposefully, with recurring lanterns and cove mirroring internal revival; bottle charges final image as untouched reminder, constraining contemplative focus without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ghost town reimagination) signaled early, with one accumulative deepening via history piecing to town response; but pressure remains abstract/internal without on-page reversal narrowing options or legible trade-off in rising-to-work beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth via imagination emerges organically from memory fragments to flourishing town; final image ("new civilization...born from the ashes") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting restoration premise, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual reverence (eyes fixed on bottle, lanterns responding); rhythmic modulation builds intensity, but minor syntactic repetition dulls peak stress without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Template cadence in repeated "The alchemist's [noun] [verb]" stems across contemplation beats and paraphrase loops ("mind racing with possibilities," "vision began to take shape") create redundancy, dulling propulsion; artifacts obscure density in pivotal memory reconstruction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical memory reviving ghost town transforms revival trope via untouched bottle and responsive lanterns; risk in static vignette heightens imagistic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
