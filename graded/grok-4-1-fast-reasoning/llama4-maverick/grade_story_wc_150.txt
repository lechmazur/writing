<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Label-speak dominates interiority ("felt a sense of cautious enchantment growing," repeated variations); no contradictory impulses or flaws complicating choices, yielding generic motivation without embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via discovery density building to CR closure in final survey ("sundial base stood at the center, a symbol"); Orientation clear early, one tightening from sundial stumble to full reveal, but summary over weeks weakens on-page causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration ("air heavy with... blooming flowers and damp earth," "roots snaked between ancient bones") filters through Maya's heritage bias, constraining exploration; orchard charges final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heritage reconnection) signaled but static under accumulative lens—no reversal, deepening, or visible cost foreclosing options; tireless work lacks pressure or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Reconnection theme emerges from particulars like artifacts and tomb layers; final image ("surrounded by the bones and the trees") offers resonant CR without moralizing, though lacks competing counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with consistent literary texture and perceptual signature (heritage-tinged noticing); no dialogue, but diction modulates meditative rhythm effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Template cadence ("As she [action]" x6) and paraphrase loops ("felt a sense of" variants x5) create redundancy, obscuring propulsion; repetitive stems dull density in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard with bone-snaking roots offers fresh synthesis of heritage trope; purposeful wandering transforms excavation into meditative arc without derivative hedging.</comment>
