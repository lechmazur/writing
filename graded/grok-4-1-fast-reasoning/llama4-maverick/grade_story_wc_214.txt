<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Abstract declarations like "strength in vulnerability" dominate without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; no internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene, rendering change unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with meditative density building to Charged Poise closure in final placement/departure reconfiguring purpose; orientation anchors early, but lacks cadence shift or tightening beyond repetition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Station's hum, whir, and starlit window integrate selectively through POV's meditative filter, subtly guiding choices; yellow lantern glass as micro-setting charges final image without constraining pivotal action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Abstract stake of vulnerability never faces on-page test or narrowing; no reversal, agency, or felt cost under accumulative lens, remaining declarative throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of stillness/vulnerability emerges from images (stars, sweeping, glass) but undermined by overt statements like "strength lies in vulnerability"; final image offers partial non-literal resonance without reweighting prior material sharply.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Meditative perceptual signature consistent in selective noticing (e.g., glass's "warm, golden hue"); stable close-third POV, but syntax monotony limits rhythmic modulation under sustained calm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops ("flourishing stillness," vulnerability motif repeated 4+ times) and template stems ("As [they]... the janitor") create redundancy, dulling propulsion; artifacts touch closure image, flattening density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Cosmic janitor" premise offers fresh meditative angle on labor/spirituality; transforms tropes organically, but lacks bold risks or hindsight-inevitable turns beyond familiar epiphany arc.</comment>
