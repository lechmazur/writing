<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Abstract labels like "pang of sorrow" and "heart swelled with emotion" in assembly beat weaken embodied contradiction and micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from egg grasp to device hum; resonant reconfiguration lands on-page at "world's rebirth" with legible emotional cost of endured hopelessness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stalactites, drifting palace, and egg constrain hand/mirrors emotions, charging final "sleeping giant" image; sensory integration vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to restore beauty signaled early, tightens accumulatively through hypothesizing to assembly crescendo forcing emotional trade-off in "surge of excitement, mixed with fear."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Flawed mechanical world vs. beauty emerges via egg patterns and device hum; final "deep, abiding peace" reweights premise organically without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual bias to patterns; rhythm modulates intensity but repetition erodes texture under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Pervasive "felt" (12+ uses) and "seemed" stacks create filter-verb clutter and paraphrase loops in climax ("heart swelled...eyes shone with tears"), dulling propulsion and closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic prince, pulsing stalactites, and egg rebirth transforms mechanical dystopia tropes into inevitable quaking-to-peace arc.</comment>
