<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Label-only traits like repeated "perceptively calm demeanor" lack embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; no internal conflict shows simultaneous impulses during the breakthrough hum and brush touch, flattening motivation depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from painting to lullaby to mirrors rippling at bells; Charged Poise closure lands on-page as painter steps back from glowing canvas with felt conceptual cost of unlocked possibilities.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prism parapet and mirrors constrain painting choices and charge final glowing image; sensory details like rippling surfaces and spring breeze integrate purposefully through POV bias for light/shadow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unlock mirrors tightens accumulatively via lullaby and bells forcing mirror response; agency in final brush touch deepens pressure, but cost remains abstract without foreclosed path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of art piercing reality emerges organically from painting/lullaby interplay; final glowing parapet offers resonant non-literal answer to wonder beyond veil without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature on light/colors; rhythmic modulation supports accumulative build, though minor repetition borders uniformity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "prism parapet" and "dusky harmony" in final third) and synonym churn in color descriptions dull closure image; overwriting with stacked metaphors obscures propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of painter coaxing mirrors via coded song transforms fantasy tropes; final vanishing into night heightens stakes through bold lyric risk without gimmickry.</comment>
