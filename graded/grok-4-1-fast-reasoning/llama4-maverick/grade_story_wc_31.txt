<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear but abstract and unembodied; generic phrases like "heart quickened" and "overwhelming sense of purpose" lack concrete interiority or contradictory impulses acting in scene, yielding no earned micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early orientation and CR closure via final realization, but lacks one meaningful tightening/deepening—wandering sequences read as outline-like and-then without narrowing options or raising cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (saltwater/decay, creaking hull, lantern glow) filter through Kael's priorities and charge the final window image; setting subtly guides descent and stacks navigation without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovery of luminous vows/color of sound) signaled early with accumulative density increase to realization, but escalation stays low-pressure without protagonist agency narrowing options or legible trade-off in pivotal discovery beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of elusive perception (color of sound, luminous vows as doorway) emerges organically from pursuit and final image reweighting reality without statement; resonance from lanterns' celestial map avoids tidy moral but lacks deeper character complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct atmospheric texture in syntax/rhythm; perceptual bias toward mystical elements consistent, though minor repetition in "felt" phrasing slightly dulls under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("felt" x5+, echoing footsteps twice, paraphrase loops in wandering/shadows deepen) creates template cadence and synonym churn, dulling propulsion in core discovery beats; overwriting in "fabric of reality woven from threads" mixes metaphors without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sunken-ship library mysticism during lantern festival transforms quest tropes through "color of sound" premise; final reconfiguration feels earned from atmospheric particulars without hedging.</comment>
