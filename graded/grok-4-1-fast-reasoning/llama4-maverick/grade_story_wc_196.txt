<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Unearned epiphany shift from broken-hearted archivist to "guardian of memories" lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; interiority defaults to summary labels like "heart swelled" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of discoveries building to CR closure ("infantryman's button, now a symbol of her own journey"); cost felt in implied mending of broken heart, but minimal tightening narrows options only vaguely.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dust patterns and button as micro-setting constrain piecing-together method and charge final image ("glinted on her desk"); sensory details (musty smell, dust) selective and purposeful, though some generic despair clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover purpose) signaled early but lacks coherent pressure or agency-driven deepening under accumulative lens; no legible cost or option-narrowing reversal, remaining abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of resilience through small kindnesses emerges from particulars but resolves into tidy moralizing ("testament to the enduring power of the human heart") in final paragraph, replacing resonance with assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with hopeful perceptual signature; voice modulates reverently but drifts to elevated diction ("unfurl the narrative threads") without peak compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "stories"/"histories" and template cadence ("As she worked," "The more Emilia uncovered") across multiple beats dull density; synonym churn in transformation descriptions pervades, obscuring propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Familiar redemption arc via symbolic artifact in dusty archive lacks fresh inflection; button discovery follows template beats without non-obvious synthesis or risk-taking.</comment>
