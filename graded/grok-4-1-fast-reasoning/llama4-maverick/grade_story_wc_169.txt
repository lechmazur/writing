<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and trait-consistent, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; vision epiphany ("knew that she was on the right path") feels unearned without micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to vision as Charged Poise RR; cost legible in "heart pounding" overwhelm before peace; orientation anchored early in grotto without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grotto, shells/pebbles, and drifting light constrain meditative patterns and charge final harmony image; sensory hierarchy (waves, ethereal light) reflects watchful POV without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (equations for hope) signaled early, tightens via pulsing gauge to vision reversal; abstract stakes limit visceral cost despite felt terror in precipice moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of imaginative hope emerges organically from gauge/patterns to multiversal vision; final smile reweights trial balloons non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (lucid details); rhythmic modulation suits serene buildup to vision intensity, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Minor "seemed to" template loops (tool, dance, alive, harmony) across beats dull propulsion slightly; otherwise dense, rhythmic prose with varied openings.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of logical dreamer launching metaphorical trial balloons into multiverse; precipice vision transforms introspection organically without template echoes.</comment>
