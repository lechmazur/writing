<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Abstract interiority dominates with label-only traits like "earnestly naive eyes" and "brittle devotion" thoughts; no contradictory impulses or embodied stress during ritual climax. Micro-choices absent, emotions summarized without particular flaws complicating the repair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dripping ritual builds density to RR closure in bell's toll and final viaduct image, with conceptual cost of restored balance legible. Orientation anchored immediately; single scene fits scope, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like salt scent, drop rings, and sapphire glow integrate purposefully, mirroring ritual transformation; viaduct recurs to charge final deepened hue image. Perception narrowed to ritual immediacies under mage's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cosmic balance via repair) signaled early but lacks tightening or reversal under accumulative lens; ritual succeeds without opposition, narrowing, or visible cost at seal/cracks moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of devotion's fragility emerges organically through bell repair and toll; final image reweights premise without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on future challenges.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual bias toward magical precision; rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate slowness to resonant fade, though minor repetition in mage's perceptions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive stems ("The mage's [state]") and paraphrase loops on devotion/devotion across ritual beats create template cadence, dulling propulsion; figurative density coherent but heavy in climax without payoff variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dripping rates method offers fresh inflection on ritual precision, synthesizing fantasy tropes via plausible impossibility; core premise transforms symbolic repair without template echoes.</comment>
