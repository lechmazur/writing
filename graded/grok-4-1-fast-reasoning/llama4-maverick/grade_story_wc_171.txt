<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses act in scene; interiority relies on abstract summaries like "determined to bring the conflict to an end" without embodied conflict or micro-choices under pressure. Traits like "flawed beauty" are labeled but do not complicate choices or reveal via action. Final "measure of peace" feels unearned without prior causal buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from poised start to hopeful close; Charged Poise closure via final image of Elian clutching clipboard under stars reconfigures redemption with felt exhaustion cost. One tightening in "negotiations progressed" via gentle approach. But causality thin—summarized progress lacks because/therefore linkages or motivated ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory details like "worn stone beneath his feet seemed to hum" and "sweet scent of blooming flowers" integrate into atmosphere, mirroring internal calm; terrace/clipboard micro-setting charges final image. Sun to stars evolution supports accumulative tone. No constraint on choices, but purposeful over vivid catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Dominant redemption stake signaled early but no on-page reversal or agency-driven tightening; "delegates began to open up" resolves without opposition or trade-off under lens. No visible price beyond vague exhaustion; pressure abstract and static.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Redemption theme emerges but via direct statements like "the price of redemption was steep"; final clipboard image offers partial non-literal resonance. Thematic echo in "anchored in practice" lowers as it articulates thesis without subtext buildup.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with consistent perceptual bias toward symbols like clipboard; voice modulates poetically from sun to stars. No dialogue to judge. Elevated diction fits literary negotiator but drifts generic without rhythmic peak stress compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn on "ebony clipboard" (repeated 6x with restatements like "symbol of his authority" → "extension of himself" → "catalyst") dull density; template cadence in celestial/body descriptions ("slow dance... gentle movement"). Figurative muddle in "stone seemed to hum with the weight of centuries." Artifacts pervade, touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Ritual clipboard in peace negotiation offers mild fresh angle on redemption trope, transformed slightly via flawed beauty. But generic arc (poised → progress → hope) and symbolic recurrence feel templated without bold risk or hindsight inevitability.</comment>
