<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Emilia's motivation is clear but told via summary ("dedicated herself to teaching her choir"); no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, and micro-choices lack pressure, rendering interiority reflective but static and stock ("pang of nostalgia"). No earned change beyond mild resolve; single-POV baseline unmet for embodied conflict under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: one continuous scene anchors early (who/where/when by para 1); density tightens via zither play to silence, yielding Charged Poise closure ("sense of peace settle over her") with felt cost in "weight of her task." No orientation debt; lens clear by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Velvet library/autumn leaves vividly selective (stained glass "kaleidoscope," rosette "dance in fading light"), mirroring internal harmony; rosette recurs to charge final image, constraining mood if not choice. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward musical nostalgia; no white-room flaws.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (braiding voices amid vanishing arts) signaled early but remains internal/abstract; one accumulative deepening via zither play ("subtracting noise") reweights harmony, but no live option foreclosed or trade-off felt on-page beyond vague "weight."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of harmony vs. hatred emerges organically from zither/images, culminating in resonant final rosette reprise without overt moral; subtext in music transcending boundaries invites reflection. Minor slip: direct "unlearn hatred" edges toward statement (−0.3), but particulars sustain complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (musical bias: notes "traveled stillness"); rhythmic texture modulates serene to resolute. No head-hopping or withholding; compression purposeful for lyric mode, taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on harmony/rosette ("intricate patterns," "wove together," reprise glinting) across final third dull closure image (−0.8); synonym churn ("beauty," "harmony") and template cadence in descriptions ("seemed to"). Density strong otherwise, rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Familiar meditative artist trope (nostalgic musician preserves vanishing art) lacks fresh inflection; rosette synthesis organic but not transformative. Emotional truth present, but no bold risks or non-obvious angle elevates beyond competent lyric reflection.</comment>
