<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Characterization told via labels ("underestimated rebel", "carefully resourceful") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; no pivotal scene action reveals values hierarchy, flattening motivation to declaration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup to Charged Poise closure (Aria's dawn smile and vanishing with key reconfigures resolve with fraught-road cost); one tightening via reappearance, but outline-like sequencing lacks motivated ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Auric lagoon's evolving glow (shimmers, pulses) constrains gathering and charges final sanctuary image, mirroring resolve through selective sensory integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resist indifference) signaled early with gathering as deepening under accumulative lens; abstract stakes lack visceral on-page test narrowing options, though ahead-cost felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of preserved histories emerges organically via key/lagoon images reweighted in final beacon without moralizing; resonance from particulars, capped by pressure limits.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias toward symbolic history; rhythmic modulation suits textural lens, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("auric lagoon" echoes, glow/shimmer synonyms) and paraphrase loops (resolve restated in paras 4-6) create mild scaffold dulling propulsion; figurative density overwrites without peak harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Auric lagoon + phone booth key synthesize fresh symbolic resistance frame, but rebel-gathering arc follows familiar template without bold character-driven transformation.</comment>
