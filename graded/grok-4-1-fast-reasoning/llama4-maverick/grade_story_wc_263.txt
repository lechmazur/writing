<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract stock phrases like "heart beat faster" and "spirit began to soar" without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; no micro-choices under pressure reveal flaws or hierarchy of values. Motivation is clear but told via summary ("devoted herself to this nightly ritual") rather than earned through struggle. Smooth progression lacks embodied conflict, yielding unearned epiphany at barrier dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of cosmic imagery builds from astrolabe adjustment to aurora intensification, tightening to Charged Poise closure as barriers dissolve with felt cost of prior doubts. Single scene oriented early (archway, aurora); one meaningful deepening via intensified display. No causality breaks; quiet reconfiguration legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Astrolabe as micro-setting constrains choices (adjusted settings, final lowering recharges image); aurora evolves causally, mirroring internal lift while filtering through dreamer's attuned perception. Sensory hierarchy vivid and selective (glow on face, solar winds whisper). Environment charges final dawn image without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free creativity) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ritual deepening and aurora pulse that reweights entrapment with visible emotional cost at dissolution. Agency in tracing and surrender narrows options texturally; no reversals needed. Cost legible in "weight of her task lifting" but pressure remains internal/low external.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic listening freeing creativity emerges organically from stardust motifs shifting to renewal, with final image ("heart full of the remembered stardust") offering non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in shadowed rapture mix avoids platitudes; ambiguity lingers in magic's "just beyond" reach. Particulars ground universals effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (celestial bias in "whispers of the cosmos"); rhythmic modulation heightens under aurora intensification without leakage. Prose texture purposeful in lyric compression; no elision or head-hopping. Voice specificity elevates cosmic attunement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in repeated "felt" constructions and "dreamer's" stems across descriptive runs dull propulsion; "shadowed rapture" reprises twice without payoff. Overwriting with stacked metaphors ("velvet expanse," "wings of pure enchantment") in peak intensification borders muddle. Density functional but rhythm varies little; closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Celestial ritual trope familiar without fresh transformation via specific choices; astrolabe adds minor ingenuity but premise echoes mystic archetype. Emotional truth in quiet renewal sincere yet median. No bold risks; synthesis organic but not inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
