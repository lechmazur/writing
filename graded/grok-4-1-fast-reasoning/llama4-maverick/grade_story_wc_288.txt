<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Solid interiority on reincarnation memory early, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or micro-choices under pressure; final understanding feels unearned without embodied struggle, reducing to abstract summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with single scene and Charged Poise closure in final image of peace and readiness; minimal tightening via day-to-night progression provides legible before/after with conceptual cost of isolation endured, but lacks decisive density increase.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like stone circle's hum and shifting shadows filter through Lyra's reverent priorities, subtly mirroring internal states; recurring sundial and library constrain reflection, charging final glint image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating isolation signaled but static, with no reversal, narrowing, or deepening under Accumulative lens; light patterns offer no pressure test or felt cost beyond vague "weight lifting."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of brittle awakenings emerges organically from sundial shadows and reincarnation echoes, with final image offering resonant reconfiguration honoring past while advancing; overt repetitions like "translate isolation into independence" blunt subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with consistent poetic texture and perceptual bias toward relics; rhythmic modulation suits reflective intensity, though minor repetition erodes propulsion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "brittle awakenings," "sundial's secrets," "translate isolation into independence" across paragraphs) and synonym churn dull density and momentum throughout; template cadence in descriptive runs obscures closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal library, auk reincarnation, and atomically reflective sundial transforms introspective tropes; conceptual integrity in library's suspension heightens isolation stakes organically.</comment>
