<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>No internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure; Lena's shrewdness and whimsy are labeled without micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. Sophia remains expository teller of backstory. Final project initiation lacks earned cost from prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of conversation building to CR closure on compassion cycles, cost felt obliquely in fulfillment over coincidence. Orientation anchored early in library/sea. No tightening reversal; envelope friendship method is off-page backstory summary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sensory details like sea breeze and book scents selective but generic, not constraining choices. Library/sea backdrop mirrors mood without POV bias or tactile navigation. No recurring object charges final sea image beyond postcard evocation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>No dominant stake with pressure; curiosity to friendship is frictionless accumulation without narrowing options or visible cost. No reversal tests commitment under lens. Project proposal lacks trade-off or live option foreclosure.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Compassion cycles stated directly ("testament to the power of small, compassionate acts") rather than emergent from conflict. Final image of sea/friendship offers non-literal resonance but larded with moralizing summaries. No ambiguity or counter-reading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with clean focalization; perceptual signature mildly character-tied to sea/cargo. Dialogue natural but declarative, lacking subtext or goal pursuit. Voice generic literary without rhythmic pressure modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "compassion" and friendship growth ("kindled... blossomed... nurtured... grow"); repetitive sea/stars invocations dull density. Template cadence in summary ending ("As... they knew"). Rhythmic variety ok but hedges momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Standard lost-item-to-friendship trope without fresh angle or transformation; locket/sea details conventional. No risk-taking; premise resists bold specifics for safety median. Envelope method feels stitched, not organic.</comment>
