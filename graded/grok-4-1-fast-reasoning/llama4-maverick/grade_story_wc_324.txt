<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to reconnect hearts drives consistent actions, with embodied curiosity guiding her approach; woman's desperation adds relational pressure. Interiority concrete in pulses/hearing aid perception, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final assurance earns her peace without deep internal conflict, fitting single-POV scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via sensory density to Charged Poise closure: mist clears post-assurance, reconfiguring grief with felt ongoing cost (fading pulses/commitment). Orientation anchored early (Aria's role/atrium). Single scene coherent, no shards/orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mist and hearing aid constrain choices (guide tracking) and charge final image (swirling shroud as veil). Sensory hush/hum purposeful, evolves causally (clears with words). POV-filtered (curious gaze), mirrors internal peace without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnect hearts) signaled early, tightens texturally to assurance peak narrowing grief options. Agency in cautious approach/assurance forecloses isolation with relational cost (desperate grip relaxes). Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, one deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Incidental heroism emerges organically from pulses-to-assurance arc, final image (mist veil, fading hum) resonantly reprices memories as living without moralizing. Subtext in photograph/whispers invites ambiguity on loss. Theme from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (curious gaze on pulses/mist). Voice texture poetic/rhythmic, modulates to hushed closure. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("searching for sister"), advances plot cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short hush sentences build density), but minor paraphrase loops on "mist" and "pulses fainter" (e.g., repeated hum echoes) dull late propulsion. Density high, no filter stacks/artifacts in peak. Clean grammar, image-driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: heart-tracer via hearing aid transforms ghost reunion into quiet heroism, pulses/hearing aid inevitable in hindsight. Risks poetic hush without gimmick, heightens stakes organically.</comment>
