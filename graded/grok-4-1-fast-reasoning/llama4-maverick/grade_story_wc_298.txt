<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear but abstractly told ("overwhelming urge to trammel the darkness"); lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, with no blind spots driving compounding mistakes. Interiority concrete yet generic, leaning on epiphanic summaries over embodied struggle. Final transformation feels earned but unpressured by prior micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from card discovery to spell-weaving response, culminating in Charged Poise RR closure ("weight of her destiny shifting") with felt soul-mending cost. Orientation anchored early ("catacomb orchard"). One meaningful tightening via environmental response suffices; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective ("tree roots snaked between ancient bones," "morbid perfume"); sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward mystical healing. Environment constrains via responsive trees/roots/bones, charging final image of infused orchard. No white-room; evolves causally with spell.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (soul-patching) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via spell-deepening with agency in weaving; cost legible in receding darkness and shifted destiny. One tightening ("trees seemed to lean in") narrows to transformation. Internal pressure coherent but abstractly felt, not viscerally tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of self-bartered transformation emerges organically from spell particulars, reweighted in final pocketed card and changed orchard without moralizing. Resonance in closing image ("trees seemed to whisper their approval") answers healing question non-literally. No tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers in lingering darkness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (mystical infusion of meaning); diction/rhythm poetic yet consistent, modulating to intensification. Purposeful "seemed to" repetition taught early as environmental uncertainty. No head-hopping; voice particular to idealist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("trees, roots, and bones" thrice in close proximity) and repetitive "seemed to" (five uses) create mild churn, dulling propulsion in weaving beats. Rhythm varies but overwrites in summaries ("felt a sense of peace settle over her"). Density functional; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb orchard and tarot-spell transformation twists mystical trope via environmental infusion. Risk in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry. Closing reconfiguration feels earned from particulars, not template.</comment>
