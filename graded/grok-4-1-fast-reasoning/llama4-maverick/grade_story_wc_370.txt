<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent traits like empathy drive the search and realization, with embodied emotion in sensing texts; internal conflict of hiding via detachment shows contradictory impulses. Epiphany at book message ("truth is not in the answer, but in the question") borders on unearned platitude, softening closure earn via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from invitation pondering to book find and dawn writing; CR closure lands on-page with emotional cost in mistake repricing and invitation reweight. Orientation anchored early (Elys in hidden library near 11pm); one tightening at message suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details (scent of paper, lantern glow, clock strikes) selective and purposeful, mirroring internal search; library shelves constrain choice in tactile search ("fingers brushed against worn leather"). Recurring armchair/clock charge final tranquility image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wisdom from mistake) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via paradox search to book message reversal deepening knowledge/options. Cost legible in foreclosed detachment path; agency in persistent reading/search, but stakes lean abstract/internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of paradoxes/wisdom in mistakes emerges organically from invitation-book arc, reweighted non-literally in writing as "staying while leaving." Message line risks platitude but ties to concrete mistake; resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature (empathetic text resonance); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise in final writing image. No dialogue; compression in reflections legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("staying while leaving," paradox mentions across paras) create paraphrase churn dulling momentum; some elevated diction ("enlarged tranquility," "nestled paradoxes") drifts register in peak reflection. Density good otherwise, but artifacts cap high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Familiar recluse-epiphany trope transformed modestly via paradox library frame, but core arc (search to peace) lacks non-obvious synthesis. Specifics like book message add inflection without bold risk.</comment>
