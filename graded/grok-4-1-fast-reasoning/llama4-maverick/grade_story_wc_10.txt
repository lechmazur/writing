<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions and micro-choices in collaboration with Eli reveal character under pressure, but generic phrasing like "sense of peace settle over her" dilutes interior contradiction during the tuning fork strike.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of vibrations and emotions to Charged Poise closure in final image of carrying music into the cold; orientation anchors early in conservatory; cost felt in silent world's endurance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Conservatory's frosted panes, tropical plants, and light spectrum mimic internal tranquility, constraining choices by providing protected space; recurring plants "leaning in" charge final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating silence to music tightens accumulatively via heat-map resonance and discord rectification, forcing collaborative trade-off; cost legible in foreclosed "discord" path during adjustments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in silence emerges organically from vibrations and heat-map, reweighting silence via final "symphony of silence"; slightly on-the-nose in "unshaken marvels" line reduces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical, biased perceptual signature in sensory details like "vibrations emanating... like ripples" fits single stable POV; rhythmic modulation builds to charged ending without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops in emotion descriptors ("sense of peace... balm... catalyst") and repetitive vibration imagery dull density in collaboration beat; strong propulsion otherwise with varied rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silent world, tuning forks, and emotion heat-map transforms post-apocalypse trope; risk in vibration-as-music pays off in resonant closure without gimmickry.</comment>
