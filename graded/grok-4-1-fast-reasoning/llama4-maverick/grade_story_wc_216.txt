<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Unearned epiphanies like "newfound understanding" lack embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; motivation summarized without internal conflict acting in scene; no visible cost on final smile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds to CR closure in timekeeper's poised readiness, but entire plot summarizes off-page actions ("had begun," "continued to probe") without on-page tightening or legible cost in capsule repair.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emerald silo and capsule anchor vividly but statically; no tactile constraint on choices, like urn handling, charges only atmosphere, not action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Timeless understanding stake signaled early but no on-page escalation or agency-driven deepening; abstract pressure lacks trade-off or cost in "discoveries."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity's power emerges via capsule-to-purpose arc, resonating in final image, but platitudes like "testament to the power of human curiosity" dilute subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with lyrical perceptual signature of stillness; rhythm modulates mildly but lacks peaks under pressure; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("new understanding," "secrets revealing," "world... new world") and template stems ("As the timekeeper...," "The timekeeper's...") pervade, dulling propulsion; artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Surreal timelessness via garage-sale cryptics transforms time tropes organically; closing journey poise feels fresh, though mystical epiphanies hedge boldness.</comment>
