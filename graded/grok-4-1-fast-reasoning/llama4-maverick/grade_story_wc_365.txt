<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Motivation to uncover truth is stated repetitively but lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; interiority generic ("thrill of excitement", "senses reeling"). No simultaneous impulses or flawed blind spots driving mistakes. Final change feels unearned epiphany without prior causal buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: succession of worlds builds density to CR revelation ("sense of clarity wash over her"), with felt cost in changed understanding. Mosaic shards through universes have legible transitions but lack taught pattern by 25%; redundant blurring weakens tightening. Orientation anchored early in spaceport.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (rust scent, glinting shard, skeletal starships) filters through map maker's topography urge, guiding exploration. Repair bay and shard constrain initial choice to pick and activate. No object charges final image beyond fade; generic sci-fi decay limits 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth) signaled but passive journey lacks agency-driven escalation under accumulative lens; no narrowing options or deepening beyond vague "threatened to overwhelm". Revelation has minimal felt cost, no trade-off in final emergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of multiverse patterns and withheld truth emerges accumulatively but through told summaries ("sense the outlines of a larger pattern"); final image reconfigures understanding obliquely without non-literal resonance from particulars. Pseudo-profundity in "changed her forever" borders platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward mapping/sensory topography; voice poetic but drifts to uniform rhythm. No dialogue. Perceptual signature in "chart the complex topography" consistent but lacks peak stress modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("senses reeling" x3, "thoughts turned to" x2, "worlds shift and blur" variants); template cadence in repetitive "the map maker [felt/sought]" stems across paragraphs dulls propulsion. Synonym churn on shard/journey descriptions; artifacts pervade final third, harming closure image clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sensory map maker and shard-multiverse premise offers mild fresh angle on portal tropes but lacks bold transformation or risk; journey feels template generic without hindsight inevitability. No close famous echoes.</comment>
