<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Interiority relies on labels like "aberrant mercy" without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; micro-choices feel declarative rather than pressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from tessera vision to stone vision tightening to renaming CR; legible cost in lingering fire memory reconfigures plaza's essence on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Recurring mosaics (tessera, stepping stone) constrain discoveries and charge visions; shattered sky and charred rubble selectively mirror internal hope amid ruin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of compassionate reclamation signaled early, deepened accumulatively via visions forcing renaming stance; cost felt in persistent devastation but lacks visceral test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Resilience theme emerges from visions and renaming but diluted by explicit "aberrant mercy" echoes replacing image-driven resonance in final lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with mosaic-biased perception; purposeful lyric compression suits accumulative drive, though some register elevation clashes mildly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("felt" surges, "as she stood") and repetitive stems across final third dull propulsion; overwriting muddles "warm coldness" image clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Retrocognitive visions and renaming synthesize renewal trope freshly, growing organically from mosaic particulars without late gimmicks.</comment>
