<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interior conflict summarized ("lying to herself") rather than shown in contradictory impulses during key search beats; epiphany at "she had been lying to herself" feels unearned without micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of numbers building pattern to CR closure ("files were not deleted, they were simply archived"); cost legible in personal void reconfiguration at ending; orientation anchored early in room description.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Archive setting ("labyrinth of servers and dusty hard drives") guides searches and mirrors void; patch as micro-setting constrains clues and charges final realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover disappearances/files) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via numbers/message tightening obsession; agency in digging yields cost in "haunting sense of absence" at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of absence/memory emerges organically, reweighted non-literally in final image ("reminder of what could be found"); avoids moralizing with resonant shift from pain to wonder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature on patterns ("brightly attentive eyes scanned"); voice modulates rhythmically but with minor register elevation in reflections.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("began to notice," "Lena's obsession grew," repeated "mystery/secrets") and template cadence in search beats dull density; artifacts cluster in reflective runs without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh digital archive ghost-hunt synthesis with numbers as map; transforms conspiracy trope via personal void but lacks bold structural risk.</comment>
