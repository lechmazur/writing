<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>No internal conflict or contradictory impulses act in scene; motivation told via labels like "infinitely patient" without embodied struggle or cost, leaving passive observation dominant even at decoding climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to pattern decode, but closure CR ("discovery seemed to take root") lacks legible cost beyond vague patience; orientation clear early on dock/rope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (salt/seaweed, foghorn, waves lapping) filters through POV's nature affinity; fog deepens to constrain visibility at climax decode without halting progress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>No dominant stake tightening under Accum lens; decoding progresses steadily without reversal, narrowing, or felt price, climax surge deflates to abstract satisfaction sans trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Preservation theme emerges from decode/seed image, but platitudinous ("world full of mysteries") without ambiguity or counter-reading; final reprise reweights mildly without non-literal punch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of rhythmic ocean kinship; syntax modulates calmly, but minor repetition of "felt a deep sense" softens under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("sense of peace/connection," repeated fog thickenings) and synonym churn ("secrets/mysteries") dull mid-scene density; template cadence in "She [action]" runs drags decode momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Quirky seed collector/knots premise freshens vignette mildly, but transforms tropes via atmosphere without bold risks or hindsight-inevitable turns; vignette feels stitched, not synthesized.</comment>
