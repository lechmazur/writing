<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; interiority defaults to poetic summaries like "driven to discover what ceilings hide" without embodied conflict or micro-choices under pressure. Final purpose feels told via unearned endurance rather than causal buildup. Ghosts remain passive observers, yielding no character-revealing friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: dust analysis causally links to compartment/logbook discovery, tightening density toward CR closure where Ezra carries "weightless burden" with conceptual cost of perpetual stories. Orientation anchored early. One meaningful deepening suffices, but lacks persistent constraint shaping tactics beyond initial scan.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (fluorescent buzz dying, scent of decay, dust layers) filter through Ezra's observant POV, guiding choices like dust trail to hidden compartment. Barrel as micro-setting charges final image, humming in toolbox. No 9+ as body/tool constraints are mild.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover hidden stories/ghosts) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening discoveries (dust→logbook→ghosts solidifying), narrowing to conceptual cost in final burden. Pressure coherent but low: no opposition or trade-off forces agency beyond passive endurance. Ghosts complicate without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of forgotten stories in cracks emerges organically from particulars (faded posters, logbook entries, ghosts fading), reweighted in final image of Ezra vanishing into city with humming barrel. Resonant non-literal answer lingers without moralizing. Minor thematic echo in repeated "secrets" borders redundancy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (dust patterns, ghost flickers, ceiling gaze). Poetic voice modulates rhythm effectively in fading light sequence. No dialogue; minor filter-verb stacks ("seeming to") in discoveries slightly dull immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("weightless burden" x2, "secrets" churn, "ghosts" repetitive across paragraphs) and template cadence ("As she [action], the [shadows/light/ghosts]") pervade final third, dulling closure image and density. Overwriting in descriptive runs obscures propulsion. Read-aloud rhythm drags from synonym cycles.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: elevator tech ghost-seer wielding horologist's barrel as key in circus ticket office transforms ghost trope into purposeful uncovering. Risky poetic accumulative drive heightens eerie beauty without gimmick. Derivative "abandoned place secrets" angle elevated by specifics.</comment>
