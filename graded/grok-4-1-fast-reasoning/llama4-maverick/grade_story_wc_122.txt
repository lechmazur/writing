<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Abstract labels dominate ("defeat the emotional numbness," "sense of wonder crept in") without embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene; micro-choices like fingering the drum feel exploratory but lack pressure-testing hierarchy of values. No safety-hedging flaws or genuine struggle compounds. Final endurance reads unearned without prior causal tilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build of hush/seasons imagery to Conceptual Repricing closure ("a new melody began to take shape... Aria was at peace"), cost felt in receding numbness; orientation anchors early (Aria in cavern amid turning seasons). Minimal tightening via insistent humming; static progression lacks one decisive cadence shift narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy vivid and POV-biased (vibrations over sound, damp earth/wood mirroring internal hush); cavern/tools tactile and lived-in, drum surfaces "vibrating with... muted energy." Recurring needle charges symbolic reprise without constraining choice, blocking 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (numbness) signaled early but static under Accumulative lens—no density break or cadence forcing trade-off; "numbness... begin to recede" lacks visible price altering tactics. No reversal tests commitment; abstract tension unvisceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence's power emerges organically from hush/drum/needle images, final "stillness... music to be made" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing. Complexity lingers in deaf musician paradox; no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (vibrations, touch over hearing) with consistent lyrical texture; syntax modulates meditative rhythm. Repetitive stems slightly erode distinction under sustained low pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("turning seasons" x4, "mirrored hush"/"filament of hush" churn, "presence... enthrall" x3) and synonym redundancy dull density; template cadence in descriptive runs ("Aria's fingers... as if"). Mixed metaphors ("womb... midwife") and overwriting obscure propulsion in build to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fresh deaf musician/silence premise transformed via vibrations/hush synthesis, but mystic journey tropes (cavern sanctuary, fog-like numbness) lack bold risk; final reconfiguration grows from particulars without late rules.</comment>
