<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses act simultaneously; interiority defaults to diagnostic labels like "sense of purpose" and unearned epiphanies such as "understanding dawns" without embodied conflict under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup of reflections to Charged Poise closure in "burdens... shared as they were with the stars," with legible emotional cost; orientation anchored in first paragraph, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory details like "scent of old books and the gentle hum" integrate purposefully, with stars as recurring micro-setting constraining reflections and charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of decoding lacks on-page test or meaningful tightening under accumulative lens; abstract "daunting task" faces no reversal or narrowed options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Shared burdens theme emerges from particulars but undermined by explicit statements like "It was said that when individuals shared their struggles," bordering thematic echo without full emergent resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with celestial perceptual bias; voice texture consistent but syntax shows mild monotony in repetitive "Lyra [felt/thought]" constructions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops on "burdens" (e.g., "weight became more manageable" to "burdens... seemed more manageable") and template cadence in "As [she worked/time passed]" across multiple paragraphs dull propulsion and closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lucid dream chronicler navigating subconscious via variable stars offers fresh inflection on scholarly isolation, transforming observatory trope organically.</comment>
