<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eira's motivation is told via backstory summaries rather than embodied in conflicting micro-choices; epiphany "she realized that the sacred was not something grand" feels unearned without prior internal contradiction acting in scene. No genuine flaws complicate her smooth success.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in final image of vanishing into mist carrying keystone memory, reweighting her creative stagnation with felt opportunity cost; orientation anchored early in spire. Causality thin but sufficient for lens—no unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "winds howled like a chorus of the forgotten" and "flowers that shone like tiny stars" integrate into action, with spire's architecture constraining exploration via mist walking. Recurring spire charges final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reigniting creativity signaled early but lacks tightening reversal under lens—keystone unstrapping resolves without narrowing options or visible trade-off; abstract stakes never test commitment with on-page complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of sacred simplicity vs. automation emerges organically through garden/keystone particulars, resonating in CR final image; subtext in spire as "catalyst for creative rebirth" avoids overt moralizing until late statement "the sacred was not something grand," which slightly tells.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in mystical noticing (e.g., "intricate carvings that told the story"); rhythmic prose modulates but drifts to elevated diction in realizations. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "testaments to the power of creativity" variants in closing beats) and synonym churn ("marvel," "beauty," "essence") dull closure image; template cadence in stacked descriptions like "glowing with an soft, otherworldly light" triggers −1.2 artifacts. Density low with redundancies stalling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of automated creativity premise with spire's mystical defiance transforms mage trope via keystone CR; risk in "brilliant dimness" tone heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
