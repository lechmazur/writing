<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Trait labels like "infinitely patient demeanor" and motivation told flatly without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; no internal conflict dramatized, only summary endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from footsteps to cobblestone quiver; CR closure in dawn image ("town reborn") with patience/time cost felt, one tightening sufficient; orientation anchored immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cobblestones and archway constrain method and charge revival image through tactile response; sensory focus on sound/vibration purposeful, filtered via tuner's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stake (revival) signaled early but escalation mild under accumulative lens—rhythm "grows stronger" lacks sharp narrowing or visible trade-off; faint "quiver" as deepening feels low-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Harmony via vibration emerges organically, shifting "wild hush" to "new sound" in final image as non-literal answer; resonance from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with sound-biased perceptual signature; rhythmic syntax apt for textural drive, though minor repetition borders elision without full pattern-teach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("rhythm... footsteps... cobblestones" churn across paragraphs) and template stems ("The [noun] was...") dull propulsion, pervading final third; overwriting muddles peak stir ("gentle quiver... whispered promise").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh vibration-based revival transforms ghost town trope via rhythmic synthesis; purposeful lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
