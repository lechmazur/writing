<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Abstract interiority dominates with unearned epiphanies like "she glimpsed the answer," lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or embodied emotions under pressure; micro-choices feel declarative rather than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in final realization and departure image, cost felt in her mirrored resistance; orientation anchored early, one deepening via temporal dislocation suffices, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like "scent of old honey and wax" and smoke dispersal purposefully mirror internal states and charge final harmony image; recurring glass as micro-setting constrains reflection without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding resistance to change) signaled early but remains abstract with no on-page narrowing of options or trade-off; minimal escalation under accumulative lens, lacking protagonist agency driving felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of kindness-infused endurance emerges organically via glass curves and oasis remnants, resonant in final image; weakened by explicit statements like "infused with the kindness of those who once tended them."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in pattern-noticing and harmonic diction; rhythmic modulation suits zen texture, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in repeated harmony/thrum phrasing (e.g., "thrum deepened, becoming a soft, pulsing heartbeat" echoes prior) and figurative density dull propulsion without payoff; some overwriting in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of zen potter, timelines, and beekeeping oasis transforms meditative tropes; risk in lyric accumulative frame heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
