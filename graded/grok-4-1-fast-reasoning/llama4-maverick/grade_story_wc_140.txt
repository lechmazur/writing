<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Abstract interiority lacks embodied emotion or contradictory impulses; motivation to reconstruct histories feels told via summaries like "layer the fragments of overheard stories" without micro-choices under pressure. No internal conflict or flaws complicating decisions; stock phrasing like "morbid fascination" undermines individuality. Closure endurance unearned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of memory-weaving, with Conceptual Repricing closure in "a sense of clarity emerged" reweighting erased histories. Orientation anchored early in port labyrinth. Lacks meaningful tightening or cadence shift; repetitive wandering without pattern break dilutes drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details like "rusty steel canyons" and echoing tides integrate into action, mirroring internal complexity. Labyrinth subtly guides navigation as memory metaphor. Static repetition of containers and tides prevents constraint on choices; no object charges final image beyond label.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconstructing histories signaled early but remains abstract without on-page reversal, deepening, or foreclosed option. No agency-driven trade-off or visible cost under textural lens; pressure static, ending clarity lacks felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory's power emerges organically from labyrinth/tides motifs and poison label reprise, offering resonant non-literal answer in stored symbol and circulating whispers. Avoids moralizing, embraces ambiguity in endless narrative. Lacks counter-readings or complexity beyond tidy clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward faded labels and whispers; voice texture literary but repetitive in phrasing like "the survivor." Syntax modulates contemplatively. Monotonous "As [clause]" openings erode distinction under sustained reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "layer the stories/fragments/narrative" across paragraphs) and template cadence ("The survivor's [noun]" starts) create synonym churn, dulling propulsion. High redundancy obscures density; closure image muddled by repetition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of container maze as memory labyrinth with poison label anchor transforms trope modestly. No bold risks or non-obvious turns; vignette feels template-derived without hindsight inevitability.</comment>
