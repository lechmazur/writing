<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Candid toll keeper's traits told via labels like "involuntarily truthful" without embodied contradiction or pressure-testing micro-choices; woman remains observational archetype; final realization lacks prior internal conflict to earn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to log discovery as CR closure ("adaptation to the changed environment" reweights failure premise with conceptual cost of imbalance myth busted); orientation anchored early; one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tower constrains access/inspection; beehive buzz/disarray specific and purposeful; nectar dusk sensory frame charges final starry vigil image; selective post-blackout details filter through toll keeper priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beehive truth) signaled early with accumulative deepening via log under lens; mild reversal narrows to adaptation view, but pressure observational with abstract cost; no live options foreclosed viscerally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of wonder in failure emerges accumulatively from log/discovery to toll keeper's line; resonant empty box/stars reprise; borders explicit moralizing in "failures that preserve wonder" (−0.3), but lingers via ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV (toll keeper bias in noticing mechanisms/honesty); poetic diction consistent ("nectar dusk"); dialogue natural/subtextual (curiosity vs. locals' views), advances beats; no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Smooth rhythmic variety supports scene propulsion; high density in beehive inspection; minor paraphrase loops ("eyes lit up/sparkled") and descriptive redundancies dull reflection beats without closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi tower/beehive with pastoral dusk tone; drone adaptation twist transforms malfunction trope organically; risk in cryptic riddle pays via revelation without gimmick.</comment>
