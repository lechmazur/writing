<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear but abstract and unpressured; no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal delving beats, leading to unearned unity epiphany at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with sensory density building to on-page Conceptual Repricing in final unity image ("felt herself becoming one"); orientation anchored early, but loose linkages soften tightening before grotto discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Subterranean lagoon vividly sensory (petrichor, lapping water, luminescent fungi) and integrated, subtly guiding delve into grotto; charges final image without constraining a high-stakes choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover mysteries) signaled early with accumulative deepening via attunement, but no agency-driven reversal or legible cost narrows options at symbol-deciphering peak; pressure remains serene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of rational-mysterious blur emerges organically from attunement progression, resonating in final CR image; borders pseudo-profundity with platitude phrasing like "place where explanations fail."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of mystical sensory bias; rhythmic prose modulates but elevated diction drifts from sensibly eccentric idiom in peak immersion beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("resonant hush," "attuning," "mysteries") and figurative overwriting pervade every beat, dulling propulsion; template cadence in repetitive "felt" constructions obscures closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Petrichor collector and psychometry-compass synthesis offers fresh inflection on mystical quest trope; transformation earns hindsight inevitability without bold risk.</comment>
