<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Characterization functional but lacks embodied contradiction; Kael's "inexplicable tug" and Lyra's puzzle-solving feel stock without micro-choices under pressure. Final "deep sense of belonging" unearned epiphany at spring flattens arc. Traits shown via nose but no flaws complicate choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory buildup from scrapyard decay to spring oasis creates Charged Poise closure with journey cost felt in "arduous" trek. Orientation anchored early in Krael settlement. Thin causality in riddle solve weakens tightening, but legible two-shard structure (discovery to arrival).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy via Kael's nose (death nostrils, creosote, water glint) filters wasteland effectively. Setting guides journey choice through dunes and gravel crunch. Recurring rust/decay evolves to orange glow, charging final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hidden spring for revitalization) signaled via riddle, with one accumulative tightening in arduous journey narrowing options. Low opposition; no reversal tests commitment before spring arrival. Cost legible in fatigue but abstract, not viscerally charging closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of purpose in desolation emerges organically via wax orb reprise and spring contrast to decay. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer (glow amid remnants) without moralizing. Complexity in hope amid "torn apart" world lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV via Kael's senses, with consistent perceptual bias (nose-led noticing). Prose texture evokes hush but drifts to generic labels like "surge of motivation." No dialogue; compression legible but lacks rhythmic peaks under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Repetitive "felt" loops ("felt an inexplicable tug," "felt a sudden jolt," "felt a deep sense") and synonym churn ("sense of connection," "sense of belonging," "sense of purpose") dull density in final third. Template cadence in sensory beats ("nose twitched," "air was filled"). Closure image glows but scaffold hedges propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc scrapyard with bloodhound/orb quest transforms tropes via wax leaf's "tinted revelations." Wax orb reprise in jaws at spring feels inevitable. Bold dog-focalized perception heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
