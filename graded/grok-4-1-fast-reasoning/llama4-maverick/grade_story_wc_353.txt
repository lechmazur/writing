<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent (create felt music in silence) but lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene; no micro-choices reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Interiority concrete in sensory attunement (fingers stained with soil/sap) but leans toward poetic summary over particular struggle. Final integration of sculpture feels earned but lacks visible personal cost tied to flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early and holds: analysis of cracks → insulator discovery → strumming awakens grove → resonant reconfiguration in final reverberation with conceptual cost (silence reweighted as empathetic heartbeat). Single continuous scene anchored by ~50 words (grove, sculptor on floor). Closure as Charged Poise legible in "grove was left to reverberate" and sculptor's smile amid lingering stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory details selective and purposeful (whispering trees, sap-stained fingers, strumming strings between trees constrain craft); grove as micro-setting guides choices (weaving, unearthing). Atmosphere of intense quiet mirrors internal drive, evolving with music's pulse. Porcelain insulator's "intricate patterns" charges discovery beat without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reweave sound's fabric via craft) signaled early, tightens texturally via insulator integration and strumming that awakens grove, narrowing to patient infusion of empathy. Agency in sculptor's analysis/strumming forecloses oppressive silence with felt cost (incremental process). Escalation coheres under Accumulative lens but lacks deeper option-narrowing trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of music as empathy emerges organically from particulars (cracks reveal patterns, insulator adds depth, grove sways in thanks); final image ("quiet heartbeat in the silence") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise. Avoids moralizing despite explicit "empathy in motion," carried by image over assertion. Minor drift toward platitude in "world that sorely needed it."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with symphonic perceptual signature (harmonics, vibrations through air); voice lyrical and consistent, modulating rhythm with emotional cadence (short sentences in strumming beat). No dialogue or head-hopping; compression purposeful for lyric mode, taught early via "tree-song sculptor."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs (pulsing energy mirrors music); density high, sentences advance via integrated detail (e.g., "fingers began to strum the strings...awaken the siskin alders"). Minor paraphrase loops ("music flowed," "music continued to flow") and repetitive "sculptor" stems dull momentum slightly; no closure impact. Elevated diction voice-motivated but borders purple in "tapestry of sound."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tree-song sculptor in post-hedgehog silence transforms artist-in-nature trope via tactile harmonics and insulator's anachronistic integration. Hedgehog uncurled as oblique backstory adds conceptual ingenuity without gimmickry. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes in quiet world, feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
