<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Single-POV interiority abstract and declarative ("a shiver ran down their spine, for they knew"); lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or micro-choices revealing flaws under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds in meditative build to Charged Poise closure ("they knew that they had achieved their goal"), but no meaningful tightening or deepening narrows options; orientation anchored early with no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent organisms and corridors provide vivid, selective sensory grounding that mirrors attunement; feather as micro-setting charges final emergence into light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (luminous respite) signaled but never escalates via reversal, density increase, or agency-driven deepening; no on-page cost forecloses a path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of hidden rhythms/belonging emerges organically from glow images and feather reprise; final departure offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with poetic perceptual signature attuned to luminescence; rhythmic diction consistent but lacks sharp modulation under peak attunement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops ("luminous respite" variations, "astrologer knew" stems across final paragraphs) and synonym churn ("essence," "soul," "rhythms") dull propulsion and obscure closure image density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Landscape astrologer" premise fresh, transforming divination into underwater quest; arc hampered by generic mystical progression without bold reconfiguration.</comment>
