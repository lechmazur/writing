<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Interiority generic with stock phrases like "burning curiosity" and unearned epiphanies; no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, only summary reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with discovery density building to CR closure ("left behind a piece of themselves" as felt cost of entwinement); orientation anchored early, but minor and-then sequencing lacks tight linkages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage functions as micro-setting constraining mood and charging final image as "character in its own right"; sensory details selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering secrets signaled early but escalation limited to mild accumulative deepenings without sharply narrowing options or visible trade-offs; cost felt obliquely at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of legacy as enduring story emerges from particulars like film and diaries, resonant in final non-literal reconfiguration; avoids moralizing but some repetition dilutes subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature tuned to echoes/whispers; rhythmic prose modulates effectively, consistent lyric texture taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in legacy/estate reflections ("it seemed" x4, repeated cartographer actions) and conceptual redundancy across paragraphs create drag; template cadence in similar sentence stems dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh angle on post-climate cartography dreaming walls transforms exploration tropes organically; singular lyrical vision avoids templates.</comment>
