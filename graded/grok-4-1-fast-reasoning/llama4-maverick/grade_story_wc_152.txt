<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; traits like "disguise wisdom as foolishness" are told without constraining micro-choices or revealing hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority poetic but generic, lacking character-particular embodiment in pivotal completion moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to Charged Poise closure at "finished their work... knew that they had succeeded... just in time," reconfiguring options with felt temporal cost of coup horizon. Orientation anchored early; lacks one decisive tightening beyond steady progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (crisp air, flickering flame, shimmering threads) reflects POV priorities; eternal candle as recurring object constrains rhythm of stitching and charges eerie final glow. Purposeful autumn details evolve to pressure urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering conspiracies signaled early, deepens accumulatively with shortening days and "newfound sense of purpose," narrowing time options with legible cost just before coup. Minimal reversal tests commitment on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths in craft emerges organically from stitching images shifting to alive chart; final smile and purpose-filled silence offer non-literal resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with perceptual signature on celestial rhythms and threads; consistent POV distance suits accumulative texture, modulating subtly at closure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Repetitive stems ("The embroiderer's," "as if," "knew that") and paraphrase loops on secrets/conspiracies/coup create template cadence and synonym churn across beats, dulling density in high-urgency near-completion stretch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Embroidery as conspiracy-unraveling tool transforms mystic artisan trope into fresh, grounded synthesis; pivotal chart completion turn feels inevitable from established celestial-stitch pattern.</comment>
