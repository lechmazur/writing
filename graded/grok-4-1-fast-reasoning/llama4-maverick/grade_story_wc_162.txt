<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Unembodied emotions via stock "sense of" phrasing; no contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; reunion change unearned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with motif density to CR closure at reunion; orientation anchored early; lacks one meaningful pattern break or cadence shift tightening stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective prism details filter through child's pattern-seeking bias and guide path choices; recurring terrace charges final image walk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Dominant discovery stake abstract with no reversal, deepening, or agency narrowing options under accumulative lens; passive resolution deflates pressure without cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maze/thresholds theme emerges organically from particulars to resonant CR reunion; minor direct echoes like repeated "necessary distances" border moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with distinct surreal perceptual signature on patterns/grain; rhythmic modulation supports lyric texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("sense of" x8, mysteries/secrets churn) and template stems ("I felt", "As I") pervade, dulling propulsion; artifacts mildly obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corn maze kinship, prism surrealism, and butterfly effect transforms labyrinth trope into spiritual discovery.</comment>
