<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Summary labels like "weight of regret" and "cerulean regret" dominate over embodied micro-choices; internal change feels told rather than acted in pivotal weaving beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via motif density (compass, tides, lace) tightening to CR closure in release; legible emotional cost lingers in "cerulean regret still present, but... no longer overwhelming."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity ("scent of wet earth," "gentle waves") mirrors turmoil-to-calm, charging compass release image without constraining overt choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Internal stake of diffusing regret escalates via lace-weaving deepening under accumulative lens, narrowing to peace with felt cost, though opposition remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Remembrance theme emerges organically from particulars (compass stirs tides, lace untangles), resonating in garden tending without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Nature-biased perceptual signature consistent in single POV; minor repetition erodes distinct texture under closure pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("rhythmically placid atmosphere" x3, "breeze carried the scent" x3, "tides of remembrance" x2) create template cadence touching closure reprise, dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ingenious lace-weaving for "color of unspoken apologies" freshly transforms regret trope, integrating organically with bonsai closure.</comment>
