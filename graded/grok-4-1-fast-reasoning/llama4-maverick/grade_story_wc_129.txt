<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear in longing to belong, but interiority relies on stock tells like "deep longing to belong" and "surge of excitement" without embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure; no simultaneous impulses shown during search or creation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from isolation to connection via search and art; closure as RR (ache transforms to peace) lands on-page with felt cost in "the ache that had once driven... now a reminder"; summary time-jumps ("Years went by") mildly dilute tightening without harming closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (glow of trees, sweet scent, humming air) mirror internal kinship webs and guide search; crystalline orchard constrains path and charges final moonrise image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging) signaled early with accumulative deepening at tag discovery narrowing to dedication; low opposition and abstract pressure limit escalation, with no live option foreclosed beyond mild ache.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of kinship emerges from art and search but grows on-the-nose via repeated "webs of kinship" statements; final arbor image resonates without moralizing, yet lacks ambiguity or counter-reading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with consistent perceptual bias toward connections; poetic diction and rhythm modulate effectively, though minimal dialogue limits subtext test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("webs of kinship" x5, "glimmering obsidian arbor" loops) and paraphrase in ending summaries ("felt truly connected... found their true home") create mild scaffold; rhythm varies but density dips in restatements.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fantasy elements like marsh-reed sculptor and crystalline crater offer fresh synthesis on belonging trope; search-for-tag inciting beat transforms via art, feeling organic without gimmickry.</comment>
