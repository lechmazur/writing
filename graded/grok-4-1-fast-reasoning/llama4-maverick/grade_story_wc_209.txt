<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Motivation to understand night-blooming flowers is consistent but static, with no contradictory impulses acting in scene; interiority defaults to stock epiphanies like "dawning hush fell over her" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Final art shift feels declared rather than earned through causal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via repeating night motifs building to Conceptual Repricing closure in "the world seemed to bloom alongside her"; orientation anchors Luna, pavilion, autumn by para 2. Vague time jumps ("as the days passed across the melting of winter's last snow") create minor causality blur without harming final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Selective sensory details like "etched glass windows glinting" and postcards' "moonlit gardens" filter through Luna's artistic bias, subtly guiding her cathedral visits. Amber pavilion evolves from vibrant to contemplative sanctuary, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding night flowers) signaled early but lacks tightening or deepening under Accumulative lens; no on-page reversal narrows options, with curiosity remaining abstract and unpressured. Final realization incurs no visible cost or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of night's interconnected beauty emerges accumulatively from motifs like moonlight flowers and etched glass, but direct statements like "intricate web of life that connected all living things" undercut subtext. Final image offers mild resonant reweighting without non-literal complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in artistic noticing (e.g., "tracing the lines and creases" of postcards); rhythmic poetic texture modulates softly. Repetitive phrasing slightly erodes confidence under sustained reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound, e.g., repeated "postcards scattered" and "amber pavilion" reframings across paras 1, 14, 21 without propulsion; synonym churn on "umbral tenderness" (paras 9, 16, 21) dulls closure image. Template cadence in "as [she] [verb-ed]" runs violates density in reflective beats.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Artist-cum-mystic transformation via cathedral window is familiar inspirational arc without fresh inflection; night-blooming motif synthesis feels organic but not riskily transformed from tropes.</comment>
