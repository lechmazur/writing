<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>No internal conflict or contradictory impulses act simultaneously; Azure Coat proceeds competently without flaws complicating choices or micro-turns under pressure. Emotions are embodied in repetitive vibrations but lack specific contradiction or degradation. Final satisfaction feels unearned without prior causal buildup of struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with sensory density building to Charged Poise closure in the final image of peace and vigilance, cost felt in ongoing fragility. Orientation anchored early in marina and sunset. Lacks one meaningful tightening beyond steady alignment success.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory details (ice creaks, gull cries, lighthouse hum) selectively build sonic harmony, mirroring internal state and constraining via fragility. Drift-ice marina charges final climb with creaking comfort. Recurring ice and light evolve purposefully without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect artifact) signaled early but pressure remains static; no reversal or deepening narrows options under Textural lens, just density without trade-off. Otherworldly energy complicates mildly but coincidence-free escalation absent. Final harmony lacks visible cost foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of sonic/logic-emotion harmony emerges organically from vibrations and protection, resonating in final sentinel image without moralizing. Particulars like creaks blending avoid platitudes. Invites reflection on fragility but counter-readings limited by tidy peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in sonic biases (vibrations resonating in chest). Prose texture modulates rhythmically with ethereal intensity. No head-hopping or withholding; purposeful compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn (vibrate/resonate/hum, creak repeated 5x) dull momentum across descriptive runs, obscuring cause/effect in alignment process. Template cadence in stacked sensory sentences ("sound of... seemed to..."). Figurative overuse in every peak beat without pattern payoff triggers −1.2; artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh sonic absolution premise synthesizes lighthouse vigilance with vibrational magic organically. Transforms fragile ice trope via ethereal harmony payoff. Bold tonal risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
