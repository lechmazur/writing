<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Motivation to archive patterns is clear but remains declarative without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; interiority defaults to vague poetic summaries like "sense of wonder, mixed with a touch of trepidation." No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, and final endurance lacks prior causal buildup to foreclose a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from archiving to shifting patterns and pulsing energy, landing Charged Poise CR in final image of pulsing patterns and dawn glow reweighting prophecy with conceptual cost (shiver, disquiet). Orientation anchored early. Lacks one meaningful tightening; meandering reflections dilute drive before closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (scent of flowers, rustle of leaves, city hum) filters through scribe's priorities, evolving with mood to charge final dawn image. Wax cylinder as micro-setting constrains task and reprises in closure. Atmosphere tensions concept without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archiving patterns) signaled early but remains abstract; one deepening via shifting patterns narrows to prophecy unease under Accumulative lens. No agency-driven turn forecloses options with on-page price; pressure static without trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of past shaping future emerges organically from memory seep, dead languages weaving spell, and prophecy image; final garden pulsing offers non-literal resonance reweighting archiving act. Avoids moralizing but ambiguity lingers without counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias toward relics/emotions; rhythmic prose modulates from fluid work to heavier anticipation. Purposeful poetic compression legible under Textural lens. Minor overwriting in repetitive phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("scribe's thoughts turned to the children... joy infectious/seeping"; "patterns pulsing/alive/energy") and synonym churn (emotional patterns/prophecy/disquiet) across multiple beats dull propulsion. Template cadence in recurring sentence stems ("As they [action]...") triggers -0.6; artifacts touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rooftop orchard, phonograph shaving archiving emotions, and accidental prophecy via dead languages transforms tropes organically. Risky surreal frame commits without retreat, heightening stakes in final reconfiguration.</comment>
