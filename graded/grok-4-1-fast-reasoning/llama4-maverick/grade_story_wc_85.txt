<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Interiority relies on labels like "guilt-ridden" and "tempered regret" without embodied contradiction in micro-choices; resolve to confront truth feels unearned as no prior scene impulses clash simultaneously. Final stance shift lacks visible cost scaled to reflective mode.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of reflections and images tightening to Charged Poise closure ("sense of resolve settle over her"); cost felt in "confronting her own demons." One meaningful deepening via carving memory; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Driftwood carvings constrain sifting action and charge memory beat, mirroring internal sieved hush; sensory details (salt/decay, grooves) selective and POV-filtered. Cobalt terrace evolves from dusk to lunar glow, subtly pressuring resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth vs unease) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via carving/memory deepening options; agency in walk/sift forecloses avoidance with felt guilt cost. Pressure coheres but remains internal/low-visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sieved hush emerges organically as core image reweighting lies vs truth, resonating in final "whisper of her presence" without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers plausibly in tempered resolve.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias toward secretive decay; voice texture poetic yet consistent. No dialogue; rhythmic modulation supports accumulative build without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("secrets" 6x, "truth/uncover" 11x combined, "weight" 4x) create synonym churn across reflections; template cadence in repetitive pondering dulls momentum in peak resolve beat. Overwriting metaphors mix without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" and false-memory genealogist synthesize fresh angle on suppressed truths; watch hand reprise transforms token prop into charged symbol without gimmickry.</comment>
