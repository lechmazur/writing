<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in family vows and breach, compelling persistence; interiority concrete via ribbon-tying and muttering to trees. Emotions embodied in reverent tending but lean tell-heavy without strong contradictory impulses in scene. Final endurance of vows earned via prior nurturing acts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of tending, seeds, orchard change builds to CR closure in Aria's return and shared tending, reconfiguring deciduous vows with felt persistence cost. Orientation anchored early in cathedral orchard. One tightening via forgotten seeds narrows to flourishing payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (chirping birds, rustling leaves) reflects Elara's reverent priorities; orchard constrains choices in tending post-breach. Final thriving orchard charges image, mirroring internal renewal. Spatial choreography coherent despite rafters scale.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging wisdom via orchard persistence) signaled early; accumulative escalation via seeds planting and days-passed vitality tightens to reweight options. Agency in rummaging/planting forecloses wither path; cost legible in sustained effort before payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of nurtured vows flourishing emerges organically from contract breach, ribbon, seeds to Aria's ribbon-sight reconnection. Final shared tending offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting "deciduous" premise without moralizing. Subtext in symbolic objects avoids platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in nature-reverence; voice texture purposeful in rhythmic, selective diction. No head-hopping; compression of days-passed fits accumulative lens payoff. Perceptual bias filters setting through healing craft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm; minor paraphrase loops in "deciduous" vows/contract but don't obscure closure. No heavy artifacts; concrete images over generics. Strategic telling in backstory anchors present micro-choices.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cathedral-orchard mender and "deciduous vows" metaphor transforms nurturing trope; seeds from bags inflect accidental renewal organically. Risk in lush rafters setting heightens stakes without gimmick; inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
