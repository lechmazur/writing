<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Uearned epiphanies dominate, like "heart expanding, the walls...beginning to dissolve," with abstract interiority lacking embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. No genuine flaws complicating decisions; traits shown via generic labels rather than actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density building to CR closure in emerging with pearl's radiance as beacon; orientation anchored early. Weak cadence shift or pattern break for tightening; soft accumulation without reweighting options sharply.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Crystal caves vividly sensory—sparkling walls, echoing footsteps, gentle hum—mirroring internal states and charging images without overt symbolism. Selective details integrated into exploration; recurring glow supports tone but minimally constrains choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No dominant stake escalation under Accumulative lens; abstract internal tension lacks on-page reversal, trade-off, or felt cost—realizations unpressured. "Task" declared but never tested concretely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of connection emerges from pearl/shell images but resolves into platitudes like "power to connect...lay within," with final moralizing. Lacks resonant non-literal answer; pseudo-profundity without counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature in glow/hum noticing; rhythmic modulation fits hush tone. Minor repetition in phrasing but voice coherent without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("it seemed" x4, pearl as vessel/key/power repeated) and synonym churn ("latent radiance," "resonant hush") dull density; therapy-speak in epiphanies. Template cadence in reflective beats obscures propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pearl/shell as emotion repositories in caves transforms mystical trope via inspector's gaze. Risks poetic hush without gimmickry; transformation test passes via specific radiance motif.</comment>
