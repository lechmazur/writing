<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Interiority relies on repetitive label-speak like "dappled resolve forming" and "tranquilly perceptive" without contradictory impulses acting in scene; no genuine flaws or struggle complicate choices, yielding stock competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with steady deepening via deciphering; on-page closure as Charged Poise in final ascent reconfigures purpose with felt transformative cost, anchored early without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Selective sensory details like "dusty tomes," "soft creak," and "faint scent of aged paper" integrate purposefully; library and stamp constrain discovery actions and charge final image of possession.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth-seeking signaled early with one accumulative deepening via hypothesis, but lacks coherent pressure growth or visible cost narrowing options; smooth discovery without trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of forgotten knowledge reshaping purpose emerges organically from particulars like annotation; final image offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, though pseudo-profundity borders platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with consistent perceptual signature focused on texts/stamp; rhythmic texture modulates calmly, no head-hopping or withholding, though minor repetition dulls under low pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Heavy "felt a sense of" loops (e.g., excitement, satisfaction, hope, pride in sequence) create paraphrase churn and template cadence across beats, dulling propulsion; artifacts pervade final third including closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sunken library premise offers fresh angle on ruins trope, but generic epiphany arc and safe discovery lack bold risk or non-obvious synthesis transforming conventions.</comment>
