<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>No internal conflict or contradictory impulses act simultaneously; oracle's mild obsession feels label-only without complicating choices or visible personal cost, as in her untroubled journey into darkness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase in deepening shadows/silence culminating in Charged Poise RR at "world was transformed, the shadows rearranged"; cost legible in textured plunge "darkness so profound it seemed to have a texture."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (sandalwood, howling winds, vibrating air) mirrors internal states and constrains the ritual; recurring booklet and fort walls charge the final return image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping endless night) signaled early with textural escalation via narrative deepening room's darkness; agency in summarizing silence narrows to journey, but abstract stakes lack visceral opposition or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of narrative reshaping silence/void emerges organically from honey-dripping words and booklet's glow; final image resonant reconfiguration answers premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature of silence-pattern obsession; rhythmic susurrus prose modulates intensity cleanly, as in "voice was barely audible, a gentle susurrus."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops (silence/hush/stillness churn across 10+ instances) and repetitive "as if" constructions dull propulsion in peak darkening beat; overwriting metaphors (honey, marbled hush) mix without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh lyric synthesis of oracle charting cosmic hush transforms mystic trope; risk in textural accumulation heightens stakes toward world-repricing closure without gimmickry.</comment>
