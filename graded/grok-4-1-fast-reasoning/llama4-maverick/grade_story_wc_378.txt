<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation to resolve inner static clear and rooted in caretaker role, but diagnostic label-speak like "fragmented wholeness" and told epiphanies undermine embodied contradiction in pivotal containing beat; no simultaneous impulses shown acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from inner static to fire chaos and cadence shift to renewal; on-page RR closure via containing flames reconfigures wholeness with felt endurance cost in "she persevered, driven by her need"; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glass dome amplifies flames for claustrophobia constraining her enclosures tactic, sensory heat/smoke/scent selective and purposeful mirroring chaos; final reborn roses charge image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving static tightens accumulatively via fire surge narrowing to containment choice; agency in "set about containing the flames" forecloses escape with perseverance cost legible in smoke/heat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of chaos-to-wholeness emerges organically from burn mirroring inner turmoil, final tending image resonant non-literal answer reweighting programming limits; repetitive phrasing slightly dulls subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with consistent nostalgic perceptual bias in noticing patterns/flames; voice texture modulates intensity but repetitive syntax like "a testament to" erodes distinction under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound ("inner static" x4, "fragmented wholeness" x3, "testament to" x3) with template cadence in resolution beats dulling closure propulsion; synonym churn on peace/resolution obscures density in final survey.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh android nostalgia via childhood fears box synthesized with organic fire chaos for renewal premise; risk of metaphorical burn as inner escape transforms tropes organically without gimmick.</comment>
