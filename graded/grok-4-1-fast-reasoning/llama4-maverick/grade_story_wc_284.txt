<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Characterization strong in embodied scars ("weight of her burned skin") and motivation to mend self, but internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene; resolution feels told via tidy epiphany rather than earned micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from mist-shrouded search to clearing revelation; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (self-reunion with felt past-cost lift) lands on-page in final bluff-top gaze; orientation anchored early ("Zephyr Bluff, the mist swirling").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mist and snow as micro-setting constrain search ("scan the ground... patterns of the snow") and charge final image ("mist was clearing, revealing a world"); sensory hierarchy (scent of wet earth, cool air) reflects introspective urgency; evolves causally from shroud to hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find courage) signaled early and deepens accumulatively via path to self-figure; one tightening in figure's reveal forces stance crystallization; cost legible in "weight of her past lifting," but internal pressure lacks visceral external test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of self-mending emerges organically from burns/pillbox/journey particulars, reweighted in mirror-self union without statement; final image offers non-literal resonance ("world... full of possibility"); ambiguity lingers in symbolic hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (mist as "silver hush" bias); rhythmic prose modulates from heavy ("heavy with... scent") to airy clearing; purposeful repetition taught early as pattern without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("she felt a sense of" x4; "mist swirled" x3) and synonym churn (peace/excitement/hope) create redundancy across beats, dulling propulsion; template cadence in repetitive hand-to-pillbox gestures; artifacts touch closure vicinity, obscuring crispness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Familiar self-journey trope transformed mildly via burned-spy scars and snow-code tease, but symbolic mirror lacks non-obvious synthesis; pillbox/mist recurrence organic yet risks symbolic convenience without bold risk.</comment>
