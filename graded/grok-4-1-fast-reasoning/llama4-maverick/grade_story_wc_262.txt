<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Interiority relies on stock phrases like "inexplicable pull" and "felt the atmosphere thickening"; lacks contradictory impulses or embodied conflict acting simultaneously. Motivation to uncover secrets is clear but static, with no intensifying higher-stakes micro-choices. Epiphany at "newfound understanding" feels unearned without prior causal buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from film strip touch to letters swirling to lyrics coalescing, tightening via visionary deepening. Orientation anchored early in projection booth. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands on-page with cost in "weight of the unused love lifting," reconfiguring love's endurance; one meaningful cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration like "scent of old celluloid and dust" and swirling letters as "autumn leaves" reflect POV priorities, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Booth constrains isolation for psychometry; final return to projector hum charges closure image. Selective details evolve causally, grounding the visionary shard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncover unused love's secrets signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening visions narrowing to realization. Agency via psychometry choice forecloses passive ignorance with emotional cost felt in "sorrowful harmony resonating." One tightening via lyrics suffices under lens, but passive immersion limits pressure peaks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of enduring unused love emerges organically from letters and lyrics as "testament," reweighted in final image of resolution without moralizing. Subtext in swirling farewells invites ambiguity on heartache's power. Protagonist arc ties to thematic question via absorbed energy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in spatially attuned visions; voice modulates lyrically from concrete booth to ethereal realm. Rhythmic prose suits accumulative tone; no head-hopping or withholding. Diction purposeful, reflecting imaginative mind without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variety and density in sensory lines, but minor paraphrase loops like repeated "testament to the enduring power" and "heavy with" phrasing dull momentum (-0.4). Figurative language coherent, no muddle in peak visions. Propulsion integrates action with atmosphere cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry, film strips, and goodbye letters transforms mystical trope into resonant love-memory archive. Visionary turns grow from booth particulars; risk in lyric accumulation heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. Memorable final reconfiguration feels inevitable.</comment>
