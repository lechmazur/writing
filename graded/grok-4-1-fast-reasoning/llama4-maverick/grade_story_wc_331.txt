<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Librarian's motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; steady work shows no internal conflict or micro-choices under pressure. Endurance in solitude feels told rather than earned through struggle. Traits like eccentricity shown descriptively but not complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from mapping to sensing stories' hum. Orientation anchored early in library. Closure as Charged Poise in "librarian smiled, knowing that she'd found the place," with solitude cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Scientific poetry library vivid and purposeful; scents, lamps, shelves filter through POV priorities. Scarf and tomes constrain work and charge ending image. Patrons' presence subtly mirrors solitude without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken stories) signaled early; tightening via increasing urgency and "pencil moved with increasing urgency" narrows to success under accumulative lens. Felt cost of isolation coherent but low opposition limits peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of living stories in hyperbolic spaces emerges from particulars like geometry traces and humming presence. Final image reweights solitude as fulfillment without moralizing. Subtext in scarf's shimmer avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with lyrical perceptual signature focused on narrative geometry. Voice modulates rhythmically from deliberate slowness to urgent pencil. No dialogue; compression purposeful for accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops on "solitude," "whispers," and "librarian remained," dulling mid-section density. Rhythms vary but repetitive stems ("As [she]") create template cadence. Closure image propels cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry and story-reawakening in poetry library transforms tropes organically. Risky premise commits fully, with scarf as inevitable symbol. No derivative echoes; solitude's conceptual cost feels bold.</comment>
