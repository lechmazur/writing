<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>All traits like "orderly intuitive nature" and "culture shock absorber" are told declaratively without micro-choices or embodied conflict; no internal contradictions act in scene. Motivation stated but not intensified through pressure. Single-POV interiority generic and summary-only, lacking character-particular revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred; summary telling builds pattern of unity but lacks on-page closure—final "residents stood ready" projects future without legible DC/RR/CR or felt cost. No continuous scene or shards; all expository progression deflates causality. Orientation anchors early (raft city, Ava), no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory anchors like "music, laughter, and the smell of exotic foods" ground perpetual carnival effectively. Setting subtly mirrors community resilience, with graffiti walls integrating action. No constraint on choices or charge to final image, limiting 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve city) signaled early, but no on-page agency, reversal, or tightening under accumulative lens—graffiti "spread" told without deepening cost. Pressure abstract; no visible trade-off foreclosing options. Escalation static summary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges implicitly via graffiti narrative, with foundation chip shifting to symbol. But overt statements like "city's spirit could not be bought or sold" moralize, flattening subtext. Final image resonates mildly without non-literal reweighting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with consistent distance; no head-hopping. Voice texture literary but generic, lacking perceptual bias or rhythmic modulation under pressure. Summary prose reduces immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "graffiti spread... sense of unity" across paragraphs) and synonym churn ("resistance," "determination") create template cadence, dulling density. Redundant summaries stall propulsion; artifacts pervade, capping high bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Raft city carnival and graffiti-chip resistance offer fresh premise synthesis. Tropes transformed mildly via unorthodox method. Flat telling mutes ingenuity; no bold risks heighten stakes.</comment>
