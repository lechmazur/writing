<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation to defy hopelessness is clear and intensifies via the stroll, but interiority relies on repetitive labels like "ambient awareness" without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The surge at the mosaic note feels earned yet lacks embodied micro-choices under pressure. Single-POV coherence is strong, but no visible cost forecloses a path beyond summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from hopelessness through observations to Charged Poise closure in the final image of "creativity... like the gentle glow of a firework's final spark," with felt emotional cost legible. One tightening at the note discovery narrows creative options. Orientation anchors early (Lyra in gardens at dusk); single scene fits defaults without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (orange glow, hush of starless sky, lantern glow) filter through Lyra's priorities, mirroring internal lift; blooming fortress subtly guides stroll and charges final image. Micro-setting like mosaic constrains discovery beat. No white-room; spatial choreography clear during walk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (hopelessness vs. inspiration) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via spinner observation and note (one deepening reweights knowledge), forcing stance crystallization in creative vision. Cost felt in prior "weight of hopelessness." Mild escalation lacks agency-driven reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of finding spark in stillness emerges organically from particulars (note "In the stillness, find the spark," spinner flames, fortress beauty) without statement; final image reconfigures premise resonantly under accumulative lens. Subtext in chants and awareness invites ambiguity on inspiration's source.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (filtering visuals, ambient sensing); voice modulates rhythmically with emotional rise (chants "growing louder, more confident"). Prose texture poetic yet legible; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Repetitive paraphrase loops ("chants growing softer... louder... softer," "ablaze" thrice, "glow" repeatedly) and synonym churn dull density, especially in final third; template cadence in descriptive runs (e.g., "As she [action], [perception]"). Momentum drags from overwriting; closure image legible but artifact-touched (−1.7 cap applied).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireworks designer drawing from spinner and mosaic note transforms inspiration trope through specific sensory accumulation. Lacks bold risk; feels organic but not inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
