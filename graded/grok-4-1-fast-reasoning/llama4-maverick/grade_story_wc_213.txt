<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation to favor listening emerges but remains abstract; interiority relies on labels like "credibly curious" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Final role shift feels summarized rather than earned through conflicting impulses acting in scene. No strong flaws complicate pivotal hesitation over bell rope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory patterns build from sirens to bell resonance, culminating in Charged Poise RR at "Ember smiled, knowing that she had found her true calling." Causality softens into summary ("as days passed"); orientation anchors early; cost legible in foreclosed siren role but lacks decisive on-page tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Windblown sanctuary vividly filters through Ember's sound-biased perception, constraining bell experiments and charging final toll image. Sensory hierarchy favors audition over visuals purposefully; micro-setting (cathedral, bell) guides shift without stalls. Spatial choreography coherent in single extended scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (track microclimate via listening) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via bell patterns foretelling weather; agency in ringing experiments narrows to new role. One meaningful deepening at glue-dry reveal reweights options; cost felt in de-emphasized sirens but remains internal/low-external.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of listening over noise emerges organically from siren-to-bell shift and wind-sound interplay, resonating in final benediction image without moralizing. Particulars like hush and rhythms avoid platitudes; ambiguity lingers in beauty-amid-turbulence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with sound-attuned perceptual signature; lyrical diction modulates rhythmically with hush-to-toll cadence. No head-hopping or withholding; compression purposeful in accumulative mode but occasional uniformity in phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Repetitive paraphrase loops ("subtle rhythms," "microclimate variations," "solstice hush") across paragraphs dull density, especially post-glue reveal; synonym churn in satisfaction/understanding beats. Rhythm varies but template cadence in descriptive runs (e.g., "felt a sense of..."); clarity holds at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of siren-tester premise into bell-conductor guardian via sound-microclimate link feels organic and inevitable. Bold risk in quiet accumulative arc transforms warning tropes into harmony; no derivative hedging.</comment>
