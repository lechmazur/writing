<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Abstract interiority relies on labels like "troubling serenity" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; no simultaneous impulses act in scene to earn final endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via sonar echoes and patterns to CR closure in vanishing legacy, cost legible in "burden of eternity"; oriented early, one tightening via frequent pinging suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (glinting gear, humming energy, petal sigh) mirrors internal patterns; gear as micro-setting charges final reminder image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (share light sans fire) signaled early but remains abstract with no on-page tightening or foreclosed option under textural lens; steady density lacks agency-driven deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of gentle cosmic sharing emerges via images but overt repetitions ("share its light without using fire") border moralizing; final image offers non-literal resonance without full reweighting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with cosmic perceptual signature in syntax/rhythm; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure despite minor redundancy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("intricate patterns," "share its light") and template cadence ("As they [action], the [element]") across beats dull density; overwriting pervades final third, obscuring propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonar-pinging sentimentalist in responsive nebula transforms cosmic tropes; risk-taking in lyric transit heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
