<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Abstract traits like "methodically curious" and "shielded openness" are told without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; no internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene. Emotions like awe and reverence are labeled summaries, not particularized through action. Final "sense of peace" feels unearned without prior causal buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via subtle pattern detection in footage, holds to CR closure in "the map, once torn and fragmented, now seemed whole," with felt conceptual cost of threshold-crossed insight. No orientation debt. Weak tightening: no meaningful density increase or cadence shift narrows options before ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere vivid in "rain-scoured fresco vault" and "damp earth and mold," selectively sensory to mirror internal focus. Setting guides mood but does not constrain choices or charge final image, as analysis occurs off-implied. No micro-setting like body/tool alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>No dominant stake faces on-page test; "uncover mysteries" remains abstract without reversal, trade-off, or felt price under Accumulative lens. Pressure static, no agency-driven deepening narrows paths. Skepticism mentioned but never complicates tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths in silence emerges via henge/map images, with CR repricing "dividing known from unknown" in final wholeness. Earned through particulars but borders platitude; no complex ambiguity or counter-reading lingers. Subtext implicit in whispers but not gesture-charged.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with cartographic perceptual signature in "creases and tears of aged maps." Voice texture consistent but drifts to elevated diction like "unshakeable sense" without stress modulation. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "secrets," "silence," "whispers" across paragraphs restate awe without advance); synonym churn in "mysteries...truths...whispers." Template cadence in reflective sentences dulls propulsion. Overwriting muddles peak insight beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and mystical henge via video analysis transforms trope mildly. No bold risks; emotional arc generic discovery without specific calculus. Transformation test fails: swaps to generic explorer yield similar arc.</comment>
