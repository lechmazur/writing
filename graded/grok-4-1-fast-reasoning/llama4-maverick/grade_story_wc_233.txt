<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Repetitive "sense of" interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; companion adds no pressure or crucible; motivation clear but untested by micro-choices under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to CR ("found a truth... change her forever"), but abstract closure lacks legible on-page cost image or reconfiguration; no orientation debt, single scene holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory selectivity (ozone, smoke, lacy glow) mirrors queen's priorities and constrains pull to ember grotto; spatial choreography coherent from cobalt edge to ridge heart.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dream mystery) signaled early but lacks agency-driven tightening under accumulative lens; no on-page reversal narrows options or shows visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight images accumulate to reweight reality's fraying, offering oblique CR resonance; avoids moralizing but resonance thinned by abstract final insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in shadow/fire biases; minimal dialogue ("Come, let us climb") apt and goal-driven; rhythmic texture consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("sense of trepidation/purpose/unease/menace" x7+), template cadence in feeling sentences, and synonym churn dull propulsion and density throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Fantasy mystic quest tropes untransformed; "lacy menace" fresh but ornamental, no non-obvious synthesis or risk heightens stakes.</comment>
