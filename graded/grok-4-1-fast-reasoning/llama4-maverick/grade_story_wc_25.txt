<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Motivation to prove whispers clear but lacks contradictory impulses or micro-choices with cost; interiority concrete yet observational without embodied conflict, especially at stranger encounter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds discoveries to CR closure via whisper proof with satisfaction cost legible in final smile; orientation anchored early, but linkages loose as finds (coin, map, key) accumulate without motivated tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid shipping container labyrinth with salt/rust, storm shadows, flickering lights constrains navigation and charges unexplored section; sensory hierarchy reflects worker's expertise without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled but no agency-driven escalation under accumulative lens; footsteps to encounter tightens mildly without foreclosing options or visible cost beyond abstract thrill.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of whispers/secrets emerges organically from discoveries to final energy reconfiguration; resonant without moralizing, though resonance relies on late encounter image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with biased perceptual signature on labyrinth details; atmospheric diction modulates tension, minimal whisper dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Solid rhythm and density in sensory integration, but paraphrase loops ("labyrinth" overuse, repeated storm references) and telling summaries ("she knew every twist") drag momentum in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of container maze as whispering world with walk ID and zodiac coin transforms maze trope; risk in geomagnetic storm adds ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
