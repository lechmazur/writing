<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Flood of memories at crystal touch feels unearned without prior contradictory impulses acting in scene; interiority concrete but lacks character-particular stress degradation or micro-choices revealing value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from whale shift to crystal DC (memories rush on touch, journey cost felt); one tightening via grounds vision narrows path, but whale trigger off-page weakens early linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory details (salt/damp scent, dripping water, pulsing blue crystal) selectively guide choices and mirror internal pull; crystalline structures constrain tunnel navigation and charge climax touch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory recovery) signaled early with gravity pull escalation, but no on-page reversal or agency-driven deepening narrows options with visible trade-off; abstract stakes dilute climax pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of rediscovery emerges via wildflowers/crystal reprise reweighting memories as reclaimable; final lantern lighting offers resonant image, but platitude ("even in darkest times") borders pseudo-profundity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias (gravity sensations, distractions); rhythmic prose modulates serenely to ethereal, distinct texture in syntax avoids generic voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("soft glow", "gleaming silence", "dock-side lantern lighter") creates paraphrase loops dulling density; overwriting in descriptive beats (tunnel/crystal) with similar stems triggers −0.6, but rhythm varies naturally elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity pockets, coffee grounds divination, salt crystals transforms mystical quest trope organically; surreal elements (whale trigger, memory flood) feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
