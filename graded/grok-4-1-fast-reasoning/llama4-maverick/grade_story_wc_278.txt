<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Label-only guilt and abstract talents lack embodied contradiction; no micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values, as tattooing proceeds unchanged by turmoil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with tightening at time-folding tether; RR closure via guilt-lift and lab hush lands on-page with felt emotional cost in final dawn image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lab's sounds, scents, and dresser anchor selectively through POV; amber and cord constrain choices and charge ending glow, mirroring internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hushing guilt accumulates via firmware whispers to time-fold crisis; tether agency narrows options with stability cost, legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of dissonance absorption emerges organically from tattoos, letters, cries; final meteor hush reconfigures priors non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with surreal perceptual signature in sound-color diction; rhythmic modulation builds pressure coherently, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops on guilt and hush motifs dull propulsion; high figurative density coherent but overwrites peak time-fold beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of tattoo-firmware-cries transforms tropes via specific logic; meteor hush risk heightens stakes inevitably to charged closure.</comment>
