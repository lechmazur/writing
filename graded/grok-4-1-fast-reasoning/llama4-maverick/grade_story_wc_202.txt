<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Motivation resurfaces via abstract summary ("long buried, began to resurface") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene; interiority relies on stock phrasing like "inexplicable jolt" without embodied conflict; micro-choices passive, no earned change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from fragment to painting insight to purpose reconfiguration; Charged Poise closure in "boundaries between worlds begin to blur" legible with felt commitment cost; orientation anchored early in market; one tightening via painting suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (sandalwood/myrrh air, glinting facets) filtered mystically; lens fragment as micro-setting constrains intuition and charges final pocket image; rooftop descent evolves coherently, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel anchors) signaled but remains abstract; accumulative discoveries escalate mildly without agency-driven narrowing or visible trade-off; no on-page cost forecloses path, pressure low-intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of honoring forgotten emerges organically from painting figure and resurfaced purpose; final "rooftops... like a canvas" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting prior motifs; avoids direct statement but borders pseudo-profundity in repeated anchors/secrets.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with mystical perceptual signature; rhythm modulates slightly with intensity; minor repetition purposeful for accumulative texture, no head-hopping; elevated diction fits but risks uniformity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade final third (e.g., repeated "anchors," "secrets," "hidden details," "unfasten/release"); template cadence in descriptive runs dulls propulsion; overwriting with stacked metaphors (glinting "like a shard of moonlight," "glow with otherworldly light") obscures density at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh angle on mystical market via intuition anchors transforms familiar discovery trope; anchors/lens synthesis organic to voice; lacks bold risk, leans on poetic generality without standout turn.</comment>
