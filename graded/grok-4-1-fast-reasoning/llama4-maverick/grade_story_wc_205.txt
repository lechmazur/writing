<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation to reimagine civilization is consistent but lacks dramatized internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting in scene; reflective telling dominates over micro-choices under pressure. Change to chronicler feels told via summary rather than earned through on-page struggle. No on-page relationships or secondary pressure to test traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of reflections building to CR closure: final image of shard as symbol reconfigures self and civilization with felt sorrow-to-hope cost. Orientation anchored early in galleries post-time visibility. Single-shard scope fits defaults; no causality breaks but thin tightening via shard find.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid vividly selective (echoing footsteps, dust-buried shard, flickering lights), mirroring internal states and constraining discovery via labyrinthine passages. Shard as micro-setting charges closure image. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward poetic artifacts over crisis immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dispute resolution via shard) signaled early but no agency-driven escalation or deepening under Accumulative lens; pressure static, lacking option-narrowing turn. Sorrow as felt cost legible but abstract, not viscerally tied to on-page trade-off like analysis failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of reimagination through sorrow emerges organically from shard, notebook, and rituals; final image offers resonant CR answer without moralizing. Subtext in quaint mirror-covering tensions uncertainty. Complexity lingers in tempered sorrow, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature (facets glinting, words flowing like river of fire). Lyrical rhythm modulates effectively; purposeful compression in reflections suits Accumulative lens. No head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Repetitive paraphrase loops (reimagine/recreate/rediscover x3+; burnished sorrow x3; labyrinthine/secret motifs) create template cadence, dulling density in reflective beats. Overwriting with stacked metaphors (river of fire, mantle) in final third obscures propulsion. Closure image muddled by redundancy; −1.2 artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of revolutionary-turned-poet-archaeologist on time-visible baroque asteroid transforms tropes via specific sorrow-reimagination arc. Shard payoff feels inevitable from early glint. Bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
