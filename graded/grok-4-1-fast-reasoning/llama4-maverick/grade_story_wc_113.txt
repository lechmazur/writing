<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation to unravel code is clear and rooted in recent inspiration, with concrete actions like tilting the program, but lacks contradictory impulses or flawed micro-choices acting simultaneously; final change feels summarily told without embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from program images to code revelation; on-page CR closure via "changed forever" reconfiguration carries felt emotional cost in the final rising image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Flooded opera house and water constrain choices (tilting program reveals markings) and charge final image of lapping water echoing La Bohème; sensory details selectively filter through Rachel's musical POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unravel code signaled early tightens accumulatively via water disruption narrowing to message clarity; agency in manipulation forecloses uncertainty with immersion cost, but opposition remains internal/mild.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of liminal music/reality emerges organically through evolving program images and swelling melodies; final image resonantly reweights inspiration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature tuned to musical hush and shadows; rhythmic prose modulates lyrically under rising immersion without distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("lanterns flickered," "water lapped," "in between spaces") creates paraphrase loops dulling mid-section density; overwriting in image descriptions slightly drags propulsion before closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of water-damaged program as code medium transforms haunted opera trope through tactile musical discovery; risk in surreal image progression heightens liminal stakes organically.</comment>
