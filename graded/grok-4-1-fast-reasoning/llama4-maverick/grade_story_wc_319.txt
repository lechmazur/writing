<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Motivation abstract and told ("longed to make friends with uncertainty"); lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, with epiphanies feeling unearned rather than compelled by micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mist density builds to reverie and CR closure ("dimensional homesickness assuaged... exactly where she needed to be") with legible conceptual cost in final pendant image; single scene fits defaults, orientation clear early, but lacks tightening beyond pattern intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mist and statues vividly constrain perception and charge closure (statues shift "macabre grins" to "serene"; mist clears to reveal threshold), mirroring internal states through tactile action (tendrils curling ankles); selective sensory hierarchy fits foggy reverie urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (embrace uncertainty via boundaries of light) signaled early but remains abstract/internal with no agency-driven reversal or narrowing; accumulative density deepens to realization, but pressure static, cost felt obliquely without foreclosing live options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of interiorizing exteriors emerges organically from mist/reverie particulars and pendant reprise, offering resonant CR answer (peace as threshold) without moralizing; ambiguity lingers meaningfully, but realization borders on overt ("gained a new perspective").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (misty, dimensional diction biases noticing); rhythmic modulation builds foggy lucidity, syntax/prose texture apt for reverie without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn ("mist swirled/thickened/coalesced/cleared" across beats; repetitive "waited" stems) dull density; overwriting with stacked figures ("ethereal tentacles... morbid perfume") in reverie beats erodes propulsion, though rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of feral guardian, dimensional homesickness, and foggy lucidity transforms library trope into vignette of perceptual transcendence; pendant's evolution feels inevitable from particulars, risking bold lyric stasis.</comment>
