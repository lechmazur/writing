<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation told heavily ("to negotiate with their own ghost") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting in micro-choices; interiority summarizes eroded ambitions without embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with fragment density tightening to Charged Poise CR in shutter click and exposed photo; cost of irretrievability legible in "past was irretrievable, but the stories... worth preserving."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon and carousel constrain scavenging choices and charge final photo image; sensory details (wheel's "clicks and whirrs," regret "mist") woven purposefully into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciliation deepens accumulatively via snippets shaping narrative, narrowing to closure click; abstract "eroded ambitions" softens visceral cost legibility before photo payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of transience vs. preservation emerges organically from fragments to photo CR; final image reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature filters surreal setting consistently; rhythmic modulation builds accumulative texture without head-hopping or elision opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("negotiating with their own ghost, reconciling the eroded ambitions" near-verbatim repeat) and synonym churn ("fractured stillness," "whispers/snippets") dull density; overwrought figuratives ("shroud," "mist," "embers") overwrite closure-adjacent beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Surreal "kinetic lagoon above the clouds" and story-fragment scavenging transform regret tropes into fresh, inevitable synthesis charging photo closure.</comment>
