<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Interiority poetic but lacks concrete contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; no micro-choices under pressure reveal values, making resolve declarative rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build to RR closure via puzzle-to-weaving shift; legible cost in "latent sacrifice" but lacks decisive pattern break, with repetitive phrasing flattening progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Bamboo forest and orchard vividly selective, evolving from barrier to conduit; amber bead as micro-setting pulses warmth, charging resolve images without constraining pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconnection signaled early but no reversal or deepening narrows options under accumulative lens; abstract pressure lacks visceral on-page test or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Reconnection theme emerges implicitly from weaving/puzzle motifs shifting to renewal; final spirit image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with perceptual bias toward symbolic textures; rhythmic repetition purposeful for accumulative mode but borders monotony without peak modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops ("raveling silence," "unraveling tapestry" x3+) and synonym churn dull density; artifacts in final third obscure propulsion and touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh lyric synthesis of loom/puzzle/orchard motifs transforms reconnection trope; risk-taking in accumulative texture feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
