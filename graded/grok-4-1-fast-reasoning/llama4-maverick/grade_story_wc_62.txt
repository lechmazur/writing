<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Consistent traits drive meditative actions like chiseling and reciting, with embodied turmoil in precise hands; however, interior conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, leaning toward summary in the grief-search realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from work to spectral urging, ribbon, poem, and butterfly CR closure; cost legible in "weight of her grief begin to shift" and persistent beauty/terribleness, with pattern tightening insight on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse at dusk anchors vividly with mist, scents, shadows evolving to lunar glow/butterflies; setting constrains reflective isolation and charges final image clustering around headstones.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake of grief discovery signaled early, escalates via textural deepening from turmoil to charged poise in butterfly realization; agency in endurance/acceptance forecloses turmoil with felt cost of grief's dual nature.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief's shape emerges organically via butterfly migration motif shifting from anticipation to clustering image; resonant non-literal answer in "beautiful and terrible" reweights life/death cycle without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with meditative perceptual signature in nature-filtered noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from precise action to lyrical close, no head-hopping or withholdings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Repetitive "sense of peace settle" and "As...the" stems create mild template cadence across reflection beats; overwriting in stacked similes like "calm as a summer storm" dulls density without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carver-ghost-greenhouse-butterflies transforms grief trope via textural migration insight; risk in lyric calm amid headstones heightens stakes organically.</comment>
