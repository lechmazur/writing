<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong concrete traits like ink wilting near dishonesty root motivation, with embodied reactions (heart quickened, shiver); however, internal conflict and contradictory impulses are summarized in piecing process rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from discovery to chamber; on-page CR closure via clarified vision carries conceptual cost of transience in final emergence beat; orientation anchored early in studio description.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (acidic mist, decay scent, whispers) filter through Aria's priorities and constrain journey; recurring toxic environment mirrors internal quest, charging final image of misty rain as fragile beauty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering lost truths signaled early and deepens via obsession; one tightening in map completion narrows to undercroft commitment with felt endurance cost; agency coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of candor and transience emerges organically from particulars like gilded scripts and repository; final image reweights premise non-literally as clarified vision amid decay, with lingering ambiguity on fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in truth-attuned noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from meticulous to immersive, no head-hopping; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in resonant ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in repeated "as she worked" and "driven by" phrases across piecing beats dull momentum (−0.6); solid rhythm and density otherwise, but minor synonym churn in decay descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligrapher questing lost conversations in toxic greenhouse transforms tropes; zinc plate and repository offer non-obvious angle, with risk in palimpsest layers heightening stakes organically.</comment>
