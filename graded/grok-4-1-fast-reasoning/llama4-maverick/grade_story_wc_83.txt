<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Amira's motivation to hunt unused potential intensifies credibly from trauma, but interiority relies on repetitive diagnostic phrases like "unfiltered awakening" without embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; Dr. Patel applies minimal pressure as expositor. Final purpose feels earned but lacks micro-choices revealing value hierarchy with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of revelations building from wreckage to data patterns; two-shard structure transitions legibly. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in final resolve with felt cost of scars; orientation anchored early in wreckage details.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sensory details like "scent of smoke and blood" and observatory's "gentle hum" integrate purposefully, mirroring internal shift; geode crystal as micro-setting constrains focus in analysis. Spatial choreography clear across shards; environment enables isolation for hunt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering destruction's cause signaled early, escalates accumulatively via data revealing potential as "catalyst"; agency in poring over data narrows options. Revelation charges final image with purpose, but lacks one live trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of awakening to unused potential emerges organically from crystal motif shifting to talisman; final image reconfigures destruction into resilience without moralizing. Subtle irony in conflict birthing purpose; overt "bleak exhilaration" slightly undercuts ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias toward crystal's essence; voice modulates from numbness to exhilaration. Minimal dialogue natural and advancing via Patel's explanation; rhythmic control mostly clean under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops on "unused potential," crystal handling, and "hunt" across paragraphs dull propulsion, with synonym churn like "stagnant potential pooling"; template cadence in repetitive resolve stems touches closure. Density low in redundant epiphany beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone trauma, geode mysticism, and perturbation theory transforms awakening trope; perturbation as method risks bold sci-fi litfic angle. Final crystal vibration feels inevitable from particulars without hedging.</comment>
