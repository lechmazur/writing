<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation to restore practices is consistent but lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; interiority relies on summaries like "deep satisfaction" without specific sensory grounding. No internal conflict dramatized in scene, reducing character depth for publishable stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from device work to communal chorus; closure as Charged Poise in final image of connection reconfigures disconnection with felt communal/emotional cost. Orientation anchored early in arbor at dawn; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Verdant arbor and dawn dew vividly selective, mirroring internal attunement; vine tendril as micro-setting constrains and charges Elara's wrist work into pulsing symbol at activation. Sensory hierarchy fits tinkerer's priorities, evolving with hush to chorus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of remedying disconnection signaled early, escalates accumulatively via hush to melody drawing villagers; one tightening at device click narrows to communal participation. Cost legible in prior "countless hours" and lingering longing, but mild agency in resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of revived connection emerges organically from vine, songs, and chorus without statement; final image of dispersing villagers with "newfound sense of connection" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise. Subtext in blurring boundaries avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature in noticing vine glow and hush; rhythmic modulation builds to chorus peak. No dialogue; purposeful poetic compression taught early fits whimsical tone without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "forgotten songs," "sacred practices," and "golden stories" across paragraphs dull density; template cadence in repeated "seemed to" constructions (e.g., vine "seemed to pulse") in activation beat triggers -0.8. Overwriting with stacked metaphors like "threads of golden stories" muddles propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer-vine-device reviving communal songs transforms fairy-tale tropes through arbor attunement; vine's evolution from wrist curl to catalyst adds ingenuity. Risks poetic accumulative closure effectively without gimmick.</comment>
