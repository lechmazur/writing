<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses or genuine internal struggle; Lyra's journey is a smooth epiphany without micro-choices under pressure or flaws complicating transcendence. No embodied conflict in pivotal surrender moment. Passive observation dominates over agency-revealing actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure (boundaries dissolve, colonnade pulses as testament). Single scene, early orientation, legible RR with felt cost in liberation. Minor issue: no decisive pattern break, just repetitive intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (frost scent, crystalline tinkling) integrated into action; colonnade pulses constrain her draw and charge final image. POV-filtered through aesthetic bias. No micro-setting constraint on choice elevates to 9-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (artistic transcendence) signaled early, escalates via textural density to cadence shift at surrender. Cost felt in dissolved boundaries, but abstract/internal with no agency-driven tightening or opposition. Lacks narrowing of live options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of art's transformative power emerges organically from images/motifs; final colonnade pulse offers resonant non-literal answer. Borders on overt statement in "testament to the power of art" line. Emergent from particulars without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct poetic perceptual signature (ethereal glows, frost-encrusted reeds); rhythmic modulation suits lyric aims. Voice texture purposeful, no head-hopping. Elevated diction fits poet but risks overwrought consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn (e.g., repeated "boundaries dissolve," "tremor of certainty," hum/pulse/whispers across adjacent sentences) dull density and obscure propulsion. Figurative language in every high-pressure beat without payoff; template cadence in descriptive runs. Artifacts pervade final third, harming closure image clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh lyric synthesis of poet-muse trope via specific images (lantern-moth hush, quartz hum). Risk-taking in accumulative texture heightens resonance. Transformation test passes via idiosyncratic aesthetic details.</comment>
