<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in lost love drives crystallization, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during pivotal hand-raising; interiority favors abstract ache over embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as descriptive density builds to crystallization then dissipation; Charged Poise closure reconfigures fears into peace with legible emotional cost in "melancholy longing" and heavy heart.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid dusk-to-night progression mirrors dissipation; atlas page as recurring object charges final empty-whisper image, subtly guiding gaze and thoughts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to name fears escalates texturally through echo buildup to writhing forms' climax; agency in raising hands yields deepening with cost in lingering ache foreclosing full release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sacrifice theme emerges organically from page, recordings, and dissipation; final connection image resonates but repeated "echo of sacrifice" near end borders on overt statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature in mystical noticing; rhythm modulates from contemplative to transfixed without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in final third ("peace... heavy heart... melancholy longing... vessel for memories") and repetitive stems ("reaper's", "echo") dull closure image; synonym churn around whispers reduces density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of heartbroken reaper crystallizing atlas monsters into fears transforms death-duty trope; sea-serpent payoff feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
