<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Knight's shift from withdrawn to purposeful feels earned through micro-choices like murmuring allegiance and unsnapping, with embodied shiver and pounding heart. However, internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; "shivering bliss reached a crescendo" reads as unearned epiphany without prior friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of energies builds from unsnap to coalescence, culminating in on-page RR (merging with entity reconfigures withdrawn state). Orientation anchored early in greenhouse. Causality intact but thinned by redundant shifts; closure cost legible in "withdrawn nature replaced by...purpose."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (rustling leaves, rippling glass, ethereal light) evolve with action, mirroring internal states; trees leaning in as "outstretched hands" charges final image. Greenhouse constrains via responsive branches and glass, filtering through knight's priorities. No white-room; vivid yet economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture possibility) signaled via program connection, tightens accumulatively through unsnap cascade and allegiance chant narrowing to manifestation. Agency in reaching/holding forecloses withdrawal with felt cost (trepidation to wonder). One deepening sufficient; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of allegiance unlocking possibility emerges organically from program, snap, and entity merge; final image ("shape...merge with their being") offers non-literal resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Particulars like puppeteer's influence avoid platitudes; ambiguity in bond lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with consistent mystical texture; perceptual bias toward energies/whispers suits withdrawn knight. Rhythmic modulation builds intensity without drift. No dialogue; purposeful repetition taught early as pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("reality shifted" x4, "murmured allegiance" repeated, "shape of possibility" churn) and template cadence ("As [reality/knight], the [element]...") dull density across build to closure. Synonym churn (mystical/otherworldly energies) pervades; artifacts touch ending image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical puppetry and possibility-capture via snap mechanism transforms knight trope through textural ritual. Snap-to-entity arc feels inevitable; bold endless-night greenhouse risks pay off without gimmick.</comment>
