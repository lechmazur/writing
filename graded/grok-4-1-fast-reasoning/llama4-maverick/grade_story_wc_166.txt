<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation told declaratively rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting in scene; interiority concrete but lacks embodied conflict or micro-choices under pressure, e.g., "she knew that it was a sign" abstracts without struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from anchoring to dance crescendo; on-page RR closure legible in verse etching on skin with felt cost of exile lifted ("weight... lifting"); orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Moonstone cabochon constrains touch/anchor and charges final image as glowing reminder; sensory details selective (scents, lapping waves) filter through POV urgency; setting guides dance choices fluidly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pen verse) signaled early with one accumulative deepening via dance observing gaps narrowing to unity; agency in twirling/leaping, but low visceral tension keeps pressure meditative rather than charged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic unity emerges implicitly from dance particulars and final skin-verse image reweighting exile/nostalgia; resonant non-literal answer in infused starlight without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in cosmic/fluid noticing (stars whispering); rhythmic prose modulates with dance intensity; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("sense of" x4, glowing repetition) and figurative density (vortex, obsidian grace) in peak dance dull propulsion; minor template cadence in summary endings, but rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tide dancer, skin-verse, nostalgia ban transforms meditative exile into cosmic art; irreplaceable moonstone speck and gaps observation feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
