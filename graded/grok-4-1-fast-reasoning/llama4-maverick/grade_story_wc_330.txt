<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Carpenter's persistent motivation to interpret silence drives the follow and return, earning a subtle change in purpose via oasis encounter; lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene, e.g., hesitation amid thickening mist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as mist/hush density builds to CR closure at dawn reflection ("wondered if the singer had been a product of their own imagination"), reweighting silence with felt cost of ambiguity; one tightening via wrong turn pays off legibly; orientation anchored in opening lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Halo fragment recurs to constrain work and charge final glow, guiding return through mist; oasis mirrors internal hush purposefully; sensory selection (chimes, cool mist) selective and POV-biased toward stillness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stake of interpreting silence signaled early, deepens accumulatively at oasis with cadence shift to shared hush; pressure coherent but low-agency, no clear option foreclosure beyond time in mist; cost felt obliquely in imaginative doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-possibility emerges organically from hush/oasis/horse progression, resonant CR in final horse image reweighting premise without moralizing; ambiguity of singer sustains complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature biased to whispers/glows; voice modulates poetically but diction drifts repetitive in hush motifs; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Repetitive "misting hush" (5+ echoes) and paraphrase loops on silence/inspiration (e.g., final paragraphs restate purpose) create template cadence and dull propulsion; overwriting in descriptive runs obscures density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of circus decay and hush mysticism via carpenter's craft; halo-oasis reweighting feels earned, transforming abandonment trope; risks poetic lyricism coherently.</comment>
