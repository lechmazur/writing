<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Archivist's reactively visionary trait is label-only without contradictory impulses acting in scene; motivation to compile fragments is told via summary rather than micro-choices under pressure, flattening internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from personal collection to public installations and community response; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration via harbor's rebirth image carries felt cost of exile's void, but outline-like sequencing weakens beat propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ivory harbor after rain anchors vividly early with sensory details like ocean-spray and musty artifacts mirroring renewal; valve as recurring micro-setting charges final image without constraining choices tightly enough for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of healing post-exile via fragments signaled early with accumulative tightening through staggered displays drawing community; lacks live opposition or narrowed options, leaving pressure abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance filling absences emerges organically from fragments-to-mosaic arc, with valve reprise reweighting loss to hope; repetitive assertions like "testament to resilience" verge on moralizing without harming closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in visionary connections, but elevated diction drifts from embodied archivist voice; minimal dialogue is natural yet underuses subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "ivory harbor" as "symbol/beacon/testament" in final third) and synonym churn ("fragments/narrative/mosaic") dull closure image; template cadence in sunset/harbor descriptions creates drumbeat rhythm touching ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Redemption-via-artifacts premise transforms exile trope mildly through visionary archivist, but familiar healing arc lacks bold inflection; valve synthesis feels organic yet not inevitable.</comment>
