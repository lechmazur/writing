<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in preservation drive, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; interiority poetic yet borders on stock epiphanies like "sense of awe" without embodied conflict. No deep flaws complicating micro-choices under pressure. Final realization feels earned by accumulation but not pivotal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in final realization and departure, cost felt in "shadows of forgetfulness" and foreclosed oblivion. Orientation anchored early in library/who/when. Minimal tightening via pattern reveal suffices but lacks sharper causal linkages narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration like "quartz hush" and fading light subtly pressures time-bound cataloging; recurring library/mist charges final image of departing guardian. POV-filtered details reflect archivist priorities without tourist catalog. Environment constrains quest through isolation and looming fade.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of conjuring meaning signaled early with accumulative pressure via discoveries, one tightening in frequency pattern reweighting harmony. Agency in sampling/endurance visible but escalation mild; cost legible in time race yet abstract. No stronger trade-offs foreclosing live options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of past illuminating future emerges organically from slide/vows/images, final shard reprise reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance in "guardian of the luminous vows" non-literal answer to oblivion edge. Complexity lingers in preservation ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in poetic attunement to hush/glow; rhythmic modulation builds lyric texture under "quiet excitement." No head-hopping or leakage; diction controlled for archivist voice. Purposeful compression legible in accumulative flow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density ("like sentinels," "like mist," "like whispers") in most sentences creates mixed metaphors and paraphrase loops on hush/beauty/mist, dulling propulsion; −1.0 for artifacts pervading beats without pattern payoff. Rhythm varies but template cadence in repetitive "as she" stems. Closure image holds clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fantasy archivist quest freshened by quartz hush/vows harmony synthesis, but library revelation trope lacks bold subversion. Final guardian image inevitable from particulars. Risks lyric accumulation effectively without gimmick.</comment>
