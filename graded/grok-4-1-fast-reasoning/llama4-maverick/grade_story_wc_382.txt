<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Stock archetypes with no contradictory impulses or embodied emotions; tutor's appreciation and student's curiosity told via summary, lacking micro-choices under pressure. No meaningful change earned through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with revelation pattern to Charged Poise CR in seal handoff ("never see the world in the same way again"), cost felt in historical weight; anchored early, but thin tightening via interrogation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (meteor glow illuminating secrets, flower scent with recitation) mirrors internal states effectively; rooftop garden coherent, but no direct constraint on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dominant curiosity stake declared early but static, no reversal or narrowing; interrogation tests minimally without foreclosing options or visible cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths emerges via seal and recitation, final image reweights worldview; undermined by overt statement ("agreed upon lies" explanation) reducing subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with minor drift, but generic narrative voice lacks distinct perceptual signature; dialogue sparse but natural, carries subtext in whisper reply.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("tutor smiled" thrice, "secrets/mysteries" loops) and paraphrase redundancy (e.g., student's realization restated in final beats) create template cadence, dulling density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Language of old buildings" inflects mentor trope freshly, but relies on familiar revelation arc without bold transformation or hindsight inevitability.</comment>
