<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Generic interiority with stock epiphanies like "forgiveness was not a destination, but a path" lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; no micro-choices under pressure reveal values hierarchy. Off-meds shift is told, not embodied in struggle. Minimal earned change in lighter heart feels uncompounded by flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern density in ivy/river/map images tightening to CR closure: Elara walks lighter-hearted into uncertainty, cost in embraced ongoing journey legible in final station-as-rebirth image. Single scene fits scope; orientation anchored instantly. Minimal causality but lens-appropriate cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ivy-shrouded station and damp earth integrate selectively, mirroring internal healing and charging closure: "ivy-covered station... testament to the power of rebirth." Sensory details (reedy notes, scent of leaves) filter through chronicler bias without catalog. No spatial incoherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) signaled early but escalates minimally via accumulative deepening: memories surface, accordion lament yields stillness, foreclosing suppression at low visceral cost. No agency-driven reversal narrows options sharply. Abstract tension lacks live trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Forgiveness-as-journey emerges from map/graffiti/river but direct recall of graffito "forgiveness is a map, not a destination" triggers thematic echo penalty, flattening subtext. Final image reconfigures rebirth without moralizing, but platitude dominates over particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern-seeking (hidden textures, whispers); rhythmic poetic texture modulates calmly. No head-hopping or withholding. Minor repetition erodes distinction under sustained reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops restate journey/solace (e.g., "path" x8, "testament" x3, "map's references" x3 in finale); template cadence in "The [noun], it seemed" and "world... full of" across paragraphs dulls propulsion. Synonym churn in forgiveness phrasing obscures closure image. Zero density in redundant endings.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of graffiti wisdom and off-meds chronicler transforms redemptive walk trope, but familiar meditative arc lacks bold risk. Ivy/accordion particulars memorable yet hedge toward safety.</comment>
