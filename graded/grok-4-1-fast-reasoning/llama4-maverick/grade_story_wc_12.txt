<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Abstract interiority lacks embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene; priest's motivation stated repetitively but no micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with soundscape build to climax; closure as resonant reconfiguration in final silence with conceptual cost of restored balance legible on page, though whispers' cessation lacks sharp before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sensory details (sandalwood/myrrh scent, sonic vibrations) selective and purposeful; blue palette as recurring micro-setting charges final image as "reminder of the power of simplicity."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel stillness to avert possession) signaled early with accumulative escalation via crescendo and insistent whispers; one tightening in ritual climax narrows to Charged Poise with felt cost in averted threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of sound/silence revealing divine truths emerges from ritual particulars; final image of "muffled clarity" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with sonic perceptual signature; rhythmic prose modulates with build but minor overwriting softens peak stress compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("unravel the stillness," "illuminate hidden assumptions") and repetitive stems across ritual beats create template cadence, dulling propulsion; figurative density overwrites high-pressure crescendo without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Loop pedal priest in dimensional ritual fresh synthesis transforms mystical tropes; sonic landscape as simplicity/divine conduit feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
