<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Label-only traits like "emotionally rational" with no embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; interiority summarizes career and task without scene-specific impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with oriented single scene; CR closure via emerging truth and clutched letter reconfigures noble lies premise with conceptual cost in sunlit triumph, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ivy recurs purposefully, mirroring internal struggle and relaxing at closure to charge final image; sensory details like damp earth integrate selectively but do not constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth-rescue signaled early with accumulative deepening via letter discovery, but no agency-driven reversal or visible cost foreclosing options; pressure coheres mildly to stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Noble lies theme emerges organically from search and letter, resonating in final ivy/sun image reweighting deception vs truth; undermined by direct statements like "rescue truth from the pit of lies" nearing echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward historical relics; distinct literary texture modulates descriptively, no head-hopping or withholding; elevated diction fits historian voice without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in truth-emergence phrasing ("peel away layers," "truth began to emerge") and repeated ivy motifs dull density; overwriting metaphors like "skeletal fingers" pervade without peak restraint, dragging propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of historian quest in ivy-choked station transforming noble lies trope via letter payoff; risks symbolic ivy personification effectively without gimmickry.</comment>
