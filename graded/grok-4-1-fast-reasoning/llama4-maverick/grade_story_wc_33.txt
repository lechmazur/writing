<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent but told abstractly ("driven by a desire to find where broken promises heal"); lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during drone-crossing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to delivery; closure as Charged Poise in final satisfaction image legible with felt risk cost, though delivery nod lacks deeper reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (neon dancing, bottle's pulse) constrain choices like timing the crossing; twilight hush and brighter arcade reprise charge final image effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant delivery stake tightens via drone diversion under accumulative lens; risks foreclose options coherently but remain somewhat abstract without visceral on-page price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Redemption theme emerges organically from package delivery and purpose renewal; final brighter arcade offers resonant non-literal answer without heavy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature biased toward purpose (notices bottle energy, drone routes); rhythmic prose modulates tension purposefully, no dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Good propulsion and density but paraphrase loops ("sense of satisfaction/purpose," repeated "mailman" stems) and minor synonym churn in reflections dull final beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantastical bottle, drone border, and abstract healing motivation transforms smuggling trope; risk-taking in textural drive heightens redemptive stakes.</comment>
