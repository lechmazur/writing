<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Label-speak dominates interiority ("geography of loss," "raw solace") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; unearned shift to resilience lacks scene-tested impulses. Reflection-heavy mode flattens struggle into summary endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via moon, calls, object to Charged Poise CR at plain ("sense of peace settle over her"); cost legible in clutching censer foot amid "never fully restore." One tightening via full moon surge suffices, but summary progression mutes on-page beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Patina bronze censer foot as micro-setting constrains final image, clutched on empty plain; selective sensory (starlit shadows, patina worn smooth) mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Object charges closure pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim loss) signaled early with moon/call deepening narrowing to acceptance; agency in "pressed on" shows endurance cost. Lacks visible trade-off in abstract journey summary before plain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented rebuild emerges organically from patchwork self/world, censer reprise shifting to possibility on plain; resonant non-literal close avoids moralizing. Final image reweights prior motifs without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (relics, moon patterns); poetic texture ("canvas of shadows and light") modulates consistently. Minor elevated diction clashes in peak ("topography of loss and memory").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("build a new path/map," repeated "sense of") and synonym churn ("purpose," "determination," "resilience") across beats dull density; template stems ("she felt a sense of") in final third obscure closure propulsion. Artifacts cap high-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-disaster navigator via moon-fluctuating senses, cryptic calls, reverse migration transforms grief tropes; censer/plain risks bold lyric reconfiguration without gimmick.</comment>
