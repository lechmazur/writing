<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear but passive; worker drawn to broken sextant without internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority abstract with diagnostic labels like "sorrow, a steady hum... began to ease," lacking embodied contradiction. No micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values; change feels unearned epiphany at repair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ascent to mapping dreams, culminating in Charged Poise RR at sextant repair with felt sorrow dissipation cost. Orientation anchored early in first paragraph (worker, tower corridors, stormy night). Pivotal repair beat ("map was complete... sextant was whole") delivers legible before/after, but loose causality in dream-weaving softens tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (ozone, wind-rain slap, lunar glow on hands) reflects POV priorities, with storm and moon constraining ascent/repair choices. Tower's winding stairs and observatory ground spatial choreography cleanly. Moonlight charges final image, mirroring internal shift; trees' late nod adds without stalling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deconstruct sorrow via dreams) signaled early, with accumulative escalation via storm intensification syncing heartbeat to pin-drop climax. No reversal narrows options; low agency as worker simply closes eyes and weaves without opposition or trade-off. Cost felt in sorrow dissipation but abstract, not viscerally priced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of mundane miracles emerges from particulars (quantified sorrow, dream-mapping, sextant glow), with final image of moonlit path reweighting ordinary/extraordinary interplay. Subtext in moon's healing power avoids direct statement until late slips like "even the most broken things could be made whole again." Resonance honest but edges toward platitude in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with consistent perceptual signature (lunar-wondrous bias in noticing glows, shadows). Voice modulates poetically but drifts to elevated diction in epiphanies ("machinery of the universe"). No head-hopping; compression purposeful in healing beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "maintenance worker" invocations, journey/wonder echoes in final third) and template cadence in descriptive runs ("The moon... cast... glow," thrice). Synonym churn dulls density; overwriting obscures propulsion in climax ("pin dropped... map was complete"). Artifacts touch closure image, dragging momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantified sorrow, dream-mapping, tree-witness secrets transforms healing trope organically. Conceptual integrity in lunar mechanics feels inevitable at sextant repair. Minor hedging in passive wonder avoids bolder risks.</comment>
