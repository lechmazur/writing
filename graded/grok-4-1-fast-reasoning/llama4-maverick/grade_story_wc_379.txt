<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation to prove "listening heals" clear but lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; realizations like "listening heals" told via summary without internal conflict acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of snippets building to CR closure via locket/note reconfiguring courtyard narrative; felt emotional cost in writer's loss legible; minor summary of "next few days reading" softens tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vibrant courtyard at dawn anchors early and mirrors internal calm disrupted by mailbox; locket as micro-setting charges final image; selective sensory hum/birds purposeful but repetitive anchors dull some specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mailbox mystery signaled early, tightens accumulatively to writer meeting narrowing knowledge; agency in inquiry but low opposition, no sharply foreclosed option or visible tactical cost beyond time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of listening heals emerges from inquiry events but final note "To those who listen, stories unfold" directly moralizes, replacing resonant image; complexity lingers in writer's loss without tidy over-resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with consistent perceptual bias toward stories/objects; voice coherent and calm-modulated but lacks distinct rhythmic texture or biased noticing under inquiry stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in realizations ("realized," "felt a sense of calm"/"contentment") and repetitive stems ("courtyard," "gentle hum") across paragraphs create template cadence; high telling density slows propulsion in investigative beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cozy thrift mystery with sentimental healing arc relies on familiar tropes (reclusive artist admirer, curative stories) without fresh transformation via specifics; locket reprise inflects mildly but not ingeniously.</comment>
