<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aria's surprise at the unforeseen pearl creates a concrete micro-choice to delve, rooting her curiosity in embodied sensations like inner rhythms; change to magnifying magic feels earned via attunement. Mild flaw: lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, with interiority edging toward generic mystic wonder.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of vibrations and energies builds to CR closure in "exhilarating and humbling" realization, reweighting her clairvoyance with conceptual cost of everyday magic over grand foresight. Orientation anchored early; single scene post-arrival tightens without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Musical crystal cave vividly constrains attunement via acoustics, glow, and vibrations, charging final image as "gateway... where boundaries blurred." Sensory hierarchy reflects Aria's priorities, evolving with delving; micro-setting (crystals, shadows) shapes sensing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expand via pearl) signaled by surprise, deepens accumulatively as senses heighten to "magic in every rock," narrowing to task reconfiguration. Agency in inhabiting depths forces humbling realization; one tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of everyday unseen magic emerges organically from attunement particulars, culminating in resonant CR: "profound magic lies not in... grand gestures but in... quiet, unseen forces." Avoids moralizing; final beacon image reweights premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in vibrational sensing; rhythmic modulation builds texture under pressure. Brief pilgrim dialogue natural and goal-driven; no head-hopping, diction fits mystic lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density in sensory integration, varied rhythm supports propulsion; strong verbs evoke harmony. Penalty for synonym churn on "magic"/"energies"/"vibrations" across final third (e.g., repetitive "unseen forces" phrasing), dulling peak slightly without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Bright darkness" and pearl's "steadily unpredictable" energy offer fresh inflections on mystic tropes, transforming clairvoyance via everyday magic lens. Familiar fantasy elements lack bold risk; synthesis organic but not inevitable.</comment>
