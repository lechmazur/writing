<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Unearned epiphanies like "a deeper truth: that even in abandonment, there was beauty" feel diagnostic and unembodied; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, with emotions told via stock labels rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with pattern accumulation in maze/symbols to CR closure (terminal rebirth reweights abandonment); cost legible in "hours passed" and effort, but lacks one meaningful tightening/deepening to narrow options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting vividly anchors via "rusting valves and gauges" constraining pipe-reroute choice; sensory details (echoing footsteps, dusty air) evolve with action, mirroring internal shift, charging final glowing image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renewal via puzzle/engineering) signaled early but remains abstract; minimal escalation under accumulative lens via single pipe realization, with no live option foreclosed or trade-off forcing agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth-in-abandonment emerges organically from maze-to-pipes progression and final beacon image; weakened by explicit "maze of intentions had revealed a deeper truth" echoing thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with engineer-specific perceptual bias (infrastructure focus); rhythmic control solid but diction occasionally generic, lacking heightened compression under peak effort.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in terminal transformation ("newfound light," "glowing," "hum of machinery" redundantly restate); repetitive "sense of" stems ("wonder," "awe," "hope") create template cadence across closing beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineer puzzle-solving in sci-fi decay yields organic renewal trope transformation; maze/sextant inflections feel earned, though low-risk structure limits boldness.</comment>
