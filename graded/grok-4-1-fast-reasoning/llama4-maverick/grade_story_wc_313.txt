<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Motivation to heal via narrative repeatedly told but lacks embodied emotion or contradictory impulses in scene; generic phrasing like "precisely humane touch" reveals no character-particular interiority. No micro-choices under pressure; warden's walk shows no internal conflict or visible cost. Static traits flatten to archetype without flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density building to CR closure in final lines ("reservoir town... testament to... narrative"), reweighting pain into promise with conceptual cost of lingering decay. Orientation anchored early. No meaningful tightening or pattern break; static walk lacks density increase or cadence shift narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "morbid perfume" and "child's forgotten toy" integrate purposefully, mirroring internal purpose through decay textures. Camera as micro-setting constrains documentation choices. Minor repetition dulls selectivity but spatial coherence holds without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (healing via photos/memory) signaled early but static with no reversal, deepening, or agency foreclosing options under Accumulative lens. No coherent pressure growth or felt cost beyond declaration. Abstract pain lacks on-page test or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of narrative healing emerges organically from resurfacing images and photo trail, culminating in resonant CR final image without moralizing. Subtext in lingering symbols like wind chime avoids tidy resolution. Recurring "stories" motif charges closure but borders on overt statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature focused on decay details; voice modulates poetically but drifts into repetitive elevated diction. No head-hopping or distance slips. Prose rhythm consistent yet lacks peak-stress compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops proliferate (e.g., "thoughts turned to the stories" thrice; "stillness/silence/muted" churn); template cadence in "The warden's [noun]" runs. Metaphor density overwrites high-pressure beats like twilight walk without payoff. Final third artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Resurfaced town premise offers fresh angle on abandonment tropes, transformed via healing narrative. But templated phrasing and looped motifs undermine singular vision. No bold risks; execution feels stitched rather than inevitable.</comment>
