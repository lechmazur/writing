<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong father-daughter dynamic rooted in shared grift traits forces Lena's resolve, but interiority abstracts into epiphanies like "mathematics of a fair trade" without embodied contradiction acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with single scene oriented early; Charged Poise closure crystallizes readiness with legible risk of capture, but lacks one distinct tightening beat beyond father's return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prep room's formaldehyde, flowers, and steel tables filter through Lena's bias, mirroring internal shift; ink pot as micro-setting charges final image and constrains reflective choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant asylum stake signaled early tightens via father's proposal narrowing to breach-or-caught binary; protagonist agency in resolve shows felt cost under accumulative lens, though pressure stays more atmospheric than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of grift as "fair trade" emerges organically from ink pot handling and waiting, reweighted in final justice resolve without moralizing; resonant image avoids tidy closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in morbid details; minimal dialogue natural and goal-driven; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "waiting" and "ink pot" across reflections dull momentum; some overwriting like "deathly vitality" strains, but sensory integration propels overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of con family in funeral home grift transforms asylum trope via ink pot's evolving charge; risk in breach poise feels organic and hindsight-inevitable.</comment>
