<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses or embodied emotions act in scene; Cipher's inventive trait is label-only without micro-choices under pressure, remaining passive and competent without struggle or cost throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held, with Charged Poise closure in final sealing and thrill of journey as conceptual cost, but no density increase or pattern break tightens stake; static descriptive flow lacks meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (neon glow, chalk drawings, distant chatter) integrate purposefully, with arcade floor constraining transcription and mirroring meditative state; chalk and clipboard charge final handiwork admiration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>No dominant stake signaled early with tightening; mild patron pressure deflates without narrowing options or agency, leaving static meditation without reversal, trade-off, or felt price under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme of slow mail's beauty emerges organically from images but overt statements ("beauty in its slowness") dilute subtext; final letter journey offers mild non-literal resonance without reweighting prior material sharply.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct poetic texture and perceptual bias toward meditative details; elevated diction fits nostalgic tone without leakage, modulating mildly with rising activity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn (e.g., repeated "warm" light/glow/ambiance, letter journey restated 5+ ways) create template cadence across beats, dulling propulsion; artifacts pervade final third including closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Chalk codes in arcade for mail encoding offers fresh inflection on nostalgia, transforming surface mail trope through specific tools; lacks bold risk as execution hedges into generic poetic summary.</comment>
