<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract tells like "deep connection to the rhythm of repair" rather than embodied contradiction; no micro-choices under pressure or internal conflict, leaving the final epiphany unearned in the hall of mirrors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from text/gears to door to hall; on-page RR (Charged Poise) in final stance amid mirrors reconfigures knowledge of craft with felt cost of fragile belonging; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen library's icy shelves and deepening shadows constrain navigation and charge the final image of library as cosmic machinery; selective sensory details (wood smoke, echoing footsteps) mirror internal priorities without cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn rhythm of repair) deepens accumulatively through pattern discovery to door-opening, narrowing to realization; low overt opposition fits contemplative lens, but visible cost in final peace is legible yet understated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of repair as universal harmony emerges organically from gears, mirrors, and library machinery without statement; final image of "intricate dance of the universe" offers resonant CR reweighting premise with conceptual cost of fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (indigo eyes "drinking in" hush/glow); lyrical voice modulates rhythmically, perceptual bias toward mystical essences consistent without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Repetitive "seemed to/as if" constructions and paraphrase loops (e.g., multiple nostalgia/peace summaries in close succession) create mild scaffold, dulling density in final third; figurative density overwrites without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith craft as cosmic repair in floating library transforms fantasy tropes; hall of mirrors realization feels inevitable from gear-pattern buildup, with bold lyrical risks heightening resonance.</comment>
