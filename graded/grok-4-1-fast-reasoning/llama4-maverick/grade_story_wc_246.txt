<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Earned progression from garden failure to pen restoration shows motivation rooted in flaws, but abstract interiority like "confidently uncertain" and epiphanic "mending the fabric of her own reality" dilutes embodied contradiction at the pivotal shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from weeds to whispers to writing; closure as Charged Poise/CR lands on-page in final ink flow reweighting past failures, with felt cost in accepting deviations as necessary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly and pen constrain choices, evolving causally ("air seemed to thicken") to charge final image; selective cosmic whispers mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to unlock pen's potential signaled early and deepens via anomaly response; one tightening in nib unbending narrows options, but cost remains more conceptual than visceral at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of editing history emerges organically from pen's lore and writing act, offering resonant non-literal answer in blurred reality/narrative; final image recharges weeds as "necessary step" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature ("cosmos's whispers"); rhythmic modulation suits accumulative build to closure, no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops ("sense that," "strange comfort" reprise without new pressure) and repetitive stems dull mid-section density; closure image propels cleanly despite minor scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of anomaly, history-editing pen, and signal ink transforms tropes; risk in cosmic editing feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
