<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Tell-heavy interiority with label-speak like "quietly deliberate nature driving her forward" lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; no genuine flaws complicate choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in final dawn/edge images with felt cost of arduous path; heavy summary of process softens linkages but orientation anchors early and closure pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Shadows and clockwork key as micro-settings recur to charge final noon pause image, constraining realization; selective sensory details (echoing footsteps, whipping wind) integrate purposefully without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Abstract stakes around shadows/reality never face on-page test or tightening under accumulative lens; no reversal narrows options, just smooth summary progression to unpressured realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge unlocking mysteries emerges organically via rune connections and key metaphor; final shadows-pause image offers resonant non-literal answer to noon question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with consistent perceptual bias toward celestial/stellar details; rhythmic fantasy texture modulates mildly but no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in research summaries (e.g., repeated "Lyra's findings began to take shape... path ahead") and synonym churn on "clockwork automaton key" create template cadence, dulling density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Quirky "spoons bend reality" and "shadows at noon" inflect familiar scholar trope with fresh fantasy conceit; synthesis feels organic but not boldly transformative.</comment>
