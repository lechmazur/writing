<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Consistent traits via olfactory sensitivity drive tending, but lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; realization at "She realized that the undercurrent of wisdom was not something to be discovered" feels unearned without embodied struggle or costed micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure at bloom's transience ("bloomed for only a few short hours"); orientation anchored early in treetop village; one tightening at "tide's thought" jolt stirs seed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Olfactory bias shapes selective sensory detail (e.g., "identify a flower by its fragrance alone"); treetops and forest constrain tending actions; final hush charges harmony image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock wisdom via seed) signaled early, escalates via accumulative density to bloom realization; cost legible in short bloom duration foreclosing prolonged access, reweighting options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of inherent wisdom emerges organically via scent expansion and patterns in doodles; resonant CR in final "wildflower hush that echoed through the trees" reweights seeking without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with scent-perceptual signature ("fragrance that was both beautiful and terrifying"); stable single POV; rhythmic modulation suits accumulative serenity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops on "undercurrent of wisdom" and "sense of" (e.g., repeated surges of energy/serenity); rhythmic variety mostly propels, but minor synonym churn dulls peak bloom density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of olfactory sensitivity, corpse flower irony, and doodle patterns transforms herbalist trope; risk in abstract "tide's thought" pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
