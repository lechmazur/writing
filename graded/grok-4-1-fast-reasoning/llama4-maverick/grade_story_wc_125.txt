<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Interiority abstract and repetitive ("felt the texture of time" lacks embodiment); no contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure compel the final understanding, rendering change unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via stone patterning to Conceptual Repricing closure ("patterns... manifestation of hidden truths"); cost legible in resonating "impossible choices," one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Grotto's "rust-red rocks" and "starlight... flickering light" constrain patterning action and charge final image of integrated designs; sensory details purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of textural discovery signaled early tightens accumulatively through "intricate" patterns reflecting "swirling complexities"; agency in excavation forecloses ignorance with conceptual cost of choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of layered time/choices emerges via rope and patterns without statement; final image ("texture of time unfolding") offers non-literal resonance reweighting energy beings as catalyst.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature of tactile vibrations; voice lyrical and consistent, though minor repetition dulls peaks; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("uncovering layers," "texture of time," "impossible choices") repeat across 8+ instances, creating template cadence and dulling closure image; high redundancy erodes density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-energy beings world via tactile "texture of time" and stone patterning transforms meditative trope; risk in lyric accumulation heightens subtle stakes.</comment>
