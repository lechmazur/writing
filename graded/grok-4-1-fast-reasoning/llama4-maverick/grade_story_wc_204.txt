<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building via accumulating prints to Charged Poise closure; conceptual cost legible in "ripples through the fabric of reality" and library's poised transformation, but passive progression softens linkages.</comment>
