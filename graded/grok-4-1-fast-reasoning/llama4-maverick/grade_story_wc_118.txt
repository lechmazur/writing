<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>No internal conflict or contradictory impulses; Emilia's "deep-seated desire" remains declarative without pressure-tested micro-choices or embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through layered discoveries to Charged Poise closure in final dragons-stirring image reconfiguring mystery's persistence, but cost legibility wanes as "sense of completion" abstracts prior buildup without pinpoint on-page price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silo's "scent of old books and dust" and narrow windows effectively build purposeful sensory immersion; recurring tapestry charges final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>No dominant stake escalation or reversal under accumulative lens; discoveries accumulate without narrowing options, trade-offs, or visible cost on pivotal reading beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of enduring stories emerges organically from particulars like charred diaries and stirring dragons, offering resonant non-literal closure without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature attuned to atmospheric subtleties, but repetitive diction erodes rhythmic control in extended reflection blocks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops ("secrets/mysteries" churn across paragraphs) and template stems ("As [Emilia] [pondered/delved]") create redundancy, dulling propulsion in core discovery beats; heavy overwriting obscures density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Post-dream silo library offers fresh premise angle, but generic mystical discovery arc lacks transformation through bold character or stakes risks.</comment>
