<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Recluse's motivation to preserve words sustains but remains declarative; micro-choices like opening the box feel observational rather than conflicted, with tears during reading as the sole embodied peak lacking simultaneous contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from approach to reading to absorption; Charged Poise closure lands on-page with cost in "weight of the unspoken words now a part of their very being" and heavy heart, tightening via ghosts stirring post-opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stained glass box recurs to constrain choice (opening it) and charge final image as glowing beacon; wasteland oasis details like ash skies and decay reek integrate tactilely, mirroring internal sorrow without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving memories tightens accumulatively when opening box stirs ghosts, forcing endurance; agency in reading/closing forecloses isolation with felt emotional cost in tears and absorbed weight charging closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance amid desolation emerges organically from letters/honeycomb and ghosts' response; final box glow as beacon offers resonant non-literal answer to loss, reweighting wasteland premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in repeated gaze/eyes filtering decay and glow; rhythmic poetic texture modulates but shows minor uniformity in perception phrasing under emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive "gaze/eyes" loops and paraphrase churn (e.g., multiple "gaze lingered/fell/locked/scanned" in opening/box beats) create template cadence, dulling propulsion; overwriting in "labyrinthine structure of twisted metal and glass" mixes metaphors without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc beekeeping oasis, ghosts drawn to honeycomb letters, and covenant echo transforms tropes; recluse's memory absorption feels inevitable from established gaze-driven particulars without hedging.</comment>
