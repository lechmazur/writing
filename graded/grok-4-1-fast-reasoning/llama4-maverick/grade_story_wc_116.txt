<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Told traits like "grips reality loosely" and "witness change without judgment" dominate over embodied micro-choices; no contradictory impulses act in scene to earn stasis. Abstract interiority lacks concrete particularity, reducing character to labels. Final endurance feels unpressured without visible cost from flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with drift of seasons building to Conceptual Repricing on legacy; orientation anchors early in library/catacombs. Burrowing deepens detachment as tightening, but lacks decisive cadence shift—cost legible in "tenuous" world connection yet static. No orientation penalty; closure intact but minimally charged.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like "scent of aged parchment," "damp earth," and "veins of crystal" integrate purposefully, mirroring decay and filtering through detached POV. Catacombs constrain burrowing choices effectively. Recurring whispers/earth subtly evolve with action, charging final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of detached witnessing tightens texturally via gaze-to-burrow deepening, foreclosing world ties with felt detachment cost in "becoming one with the catacombs." Agency in resolve to dig narrows options under silence pressure. Quiet endurance suffices for length, no reversals needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Transience and regenerative silence emerge organically from swan folds, burrowing, and seasonal drift, reweighted in final legacy image without statement. Complexity lingers in beauty of decay vs. purpose. No moralizing; resonance from particulars like "whispers of the earth."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with detached, lore-biased perceptual signature in phrases like "fabric of the world unravel." Voice texture consistent in rhythmic drifting syntax. Minor repetition erodes distinction but no head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound—"drift of untold seasons" repeats 3x, "chronicle keeper" formulaic across sentences, "regenerative silence" synonym-churned without propulsion. Template cadence in stacked descriptions dulls density; artifacts pervade final third, obscuring closure image sharpness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami divination and burrowing witness transforms hermit trope via silence-regen premise. Origami swan and obsidian refuge offer non-obvious angles on time/decay. Risky meditative stasis commits fully, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
