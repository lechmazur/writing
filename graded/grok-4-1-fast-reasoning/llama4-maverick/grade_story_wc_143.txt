<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Generic interiority with stock phrases like "inexplicable connection" to sand grain; no contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure reveal character depth, leaving motivation declarative rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup to dawn photography; closure as Conceptual Repricing in final descent image reconfigures transience with emotional cost legible in "dawnlit melancholy"; orientation anchored early, one tightening via optimal light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "silvery glow" and craters constrain photo timing; lunar vacuum noted but contradicted by "petals...swayed gently in the breeze," minor physics slip; atmosphere charges melancholy effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture last flora signaled early, escalates accumulatively via message warning and dawn light narrowing window; mild agency in enduring conditions, cost felt in tears but lacks visceral test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Transience theme emerges via flora and sand grain images, resonant in final "bittersweet reminder"; undermined by explicit repetitions like "poignant reminder of the fragility/transience of life," bordering on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature on lunar details; rhythmic texture modulates but elevated diction occasionally drifts from inspector's lexicon; no dialogue, compression legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops, e.g., "stillness...almost palpable, a dawning hush that seemed to reverberate through every molecule of air" repeats verbatim twice, including near closure; synonym churn on "poignant reminder" (thrice) dulls final image propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lunar flora and earthly hourglass grain evokes time's passage; sentimental arc feels familiar without bold transformation, though moonlit setting adds specificity.</comment>
