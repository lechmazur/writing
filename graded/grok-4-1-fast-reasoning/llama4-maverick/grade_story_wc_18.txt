<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation to capture dream is consistent and intensifies via sextant grounding to self-blurring, but interiority relies on abstract "heart swelled" and "spirit soared" without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal mirror-making beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory density builds from fog whisper to mirror completion; closure as conceptual repricing lands on-page with cost in "mirror maker vanished into the fog," reconfiguring reality-boundaries.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Shimmer of twilight frost recurs as recurring object constraining dream attunement and charging final glass mountains image; fog and orchard details selectively mirror internal expansion without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture dream tightens accumulatively via breathing expansion and boundary blur, forcing self-loss trade-off legible at vanishing; one deepening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Erasing boundaries theme emerges organically from sextant rebirth to mirror doorway, with final glass mountains image offering resonant non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with shimmer/fog-biased perceptual signature; rhythmic prose modulates from heavy scents to expectant hush, maintaining texture under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Patterned "shimmer" and "boundaries erased" phrasing teaches lyric accumulation but creates minor paraphrase loops in final third, dulling propulsion slightly; density otherwise propels.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sextant-to-mirror synthesis transforms reflection tropes into dream doorway with fresh fog-shrouded orchard angle; risk in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
