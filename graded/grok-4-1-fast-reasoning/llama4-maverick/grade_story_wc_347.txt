<question>1</question>
<grade>4.9</grade>
<comment>Reluctant trait told early but never conflicts choices or shows internal contradiction; generic emotions like "surge of determination" and "sense of pride" lack embodiment. No flawed micro-choices under pressure; motivation shifts conveniently without prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds (nut → blueprint → reactivation) with on-page DC closure as stones glow and travelers emerge, cost felt in pre-frost urgency. Orientation anchored early; lens clear by midpoint. Minor teleport: blueprint suddenly reveals labyrinth guide without orchard tie.</comment>
<question>3</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Labyrinth and birds constrain choices (shiver under patrol, impressions method); dust/smell in cottage, glowing stones selective and purposeful. Sensory hierarchy fits caretaker's priorities. Mechanical birds charge final swoop effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (reactivate before frost) tightens via birds' watch and sunset urgency, narrowing options with agency in impressions. Cost legible in shiver and haste; one causal deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of danger-to-hope emerges organically via reactivation and travelers' wonder; nut reprise reweights restoration without moralizing. Final image (glowing nut, frost veil) resonates non-literally. No overt statements.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Single POV stable, perceptual bias in orchard/cottage details; prose texture consistent but lacks rhythmic peaks under stress. No dialogue. Minor filter-verb stacks ("felt") dull immediacy slightly.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Repetitive "felt a sense" and "as [temporal]" stems create template cadence; minor paraphrase loops (pride/satisfaction). Density fair but hedges like "seemed to resist" reduce propulsion. Closure image clear despite.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of cursed orchard, mechanical birds, impression method transforms labyrinth trope organically. Risk in non-touch mechanic heightens ingenuity without gimmick; premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
