<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interiority tells repetitive "felt" states like "felt a surge of memories" without contradictory impulses acting in scene; final peace arrives via summary rather than micro-choices under pressure, muting embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as echo density builds from coin touch to vortex, yielding Charged Poise closure in "sense of peace settle over her" with nostalgic cost; orientation anchors early in twilight garden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Garden's sensory shifts—"trees rearranging... labyrinthine path"—constrain Echo's immersion and charge final image; synesthetic filter selects purposeful details like "shimmering lights... whispers of forgotten melodies."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of timeline repair escalates via echo intensification under accumulative lens, narrowing to success; lacks visceral trade-off as "weight of her nostalgia" remains abstract without foreclosed option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Nostalgia-redemption theme emerges implicitly from echo-weaving to coin's "soft, otherworldly light," reweighting fragments without moralizing; final cycle-awaiting maze offers resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature—"perceive the world in vibrant, Technicolor hues"—sustains distinct POV; rhythmic modulation builds immersion, though minor purple drifts like "distilled into a potent elixir."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in garden shifts—"air was filled... grew sweeter... vibrating"—and "felt" repetition dull propulsion; synonym churn on echoes/scents creates template cadence without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic ghost repairing timeline via performative echoes synthesizes fresh angle on redemption; coin's evolution from buried key to smiling relic feels inevitable and particular.</comment>
