<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Generic interiority and unearned epiphanies like "find the beginning in every ending" at the discovery beat fail to show contradictory impulses acting in scene, pulling down elite depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing closure in final image of fragment resonating forever; cost legible as lifelong journey beyond perception.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting anchors vividly and guides choices, like resonance leading to hidden chamber; final city silhouette charges closure image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering shard tightens via one deepening (message deciphering) under Accumulative lens, but abstract stakes lack visceral on-page cost at crescendo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in decay emerges organically from particulars like star fragment and hush echo; final non-literal resonant image lingers, though near-platitude in "magic...beyond perception" borders echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature attuned to celestial signals; lyrical rhythm modulates effectively to crescendo without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetitive "felt" phrasing (e.g., 8 instances across peak beats) creates paraphrase loops dulling density; some template cadence in "As she..." openings in final third harms propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of celestial interpreter in radio ruins transforms ruin-exploration trope; Hollywood fragment inflects oddly but organically toward hush motif.</comment>
