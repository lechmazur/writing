<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses act in scene; realizations like "secret lay not in the individual components" arrive via summary epiphany without micro-choices under pressure, leaving traits like "kindly methodical" as labels only.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from stillness to mist-clearing CR closure charged by seed glow and harmony; one tightening via arbor-as-nexus insight; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor's mist, hum, and clouds evolve purposefully with Elara's thoughts, mirroring internal shift and charging final bathed-in-light image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to bridge realms signaled early and deepens accumulatively via analogies, but lacks on-page trade-off or visceral test; mild conceptual cost in ongoing journey.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interconnected web theme emerges organically from seed/arbor/spirits parallels, resonating in final relational realization without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with translator-biased analogical perception; rhythmic control adequate but undercut by repetitive stems like "felt a sense of".</question>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops ("reestablish" 6x, repeated "sense of" realizations, mist/seed glow restatements) create template cadence across realizations, dulling closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magnetic nexus arbor, pulsing knowledge seed, and cuneiform analogies transforms realm-transition tropes into organic premise.</comment>
