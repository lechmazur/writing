<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interiority leans on labels like "groundedly imaginative intensity" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values; motivation declared via backstory but not tested under pressure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Charged poise closure lands in the final hovering pen with felt conceptual cost of dynamic unfolding versus stagnation; accumulative/textural lens holds through imagery buildup, though lacks decisive tightening beyond anticipation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Frozen lake as blank page and obsidian spire as constraint charge the poised final image, with sensory details like snow crunch and quill rustle integrated purposefully through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Internal stake of innovation versus constraint deepens accumulatively as mental writing gains confidence, narrowing to poised release; cost legible in task's weight but lacks protagonist agency forcing trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformation within bounds emerges implicitly from quill on blank page and spire sentinel, with final image resonantly reweighting constraint as catalyst without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature of imaginative patterns suits accumulative lens; stable single POV, though rhythmic elevation drifts slightly from embodied crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in "pen hovered/poised/threshold" and repetitive "cartographer" across final third dull propulsion; overwriting metaphors cohere but reduce density in peak anticipation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ignorance cartographer synthesizing predictive writing on frozen expanse transforms stasis trope into charged poise, with quill and spire enabling fresh, inevitable lyric risk.</comment>
