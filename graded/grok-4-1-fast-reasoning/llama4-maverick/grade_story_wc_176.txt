<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear but lacks intensification through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; interiority relies on summaries like "labor of love" without embodied conflict. Final satisfaction feels unearned, told via abstract peace rather than dramatized cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with process building to Charged Poise closure at the pluck producing the hum; orientation anchored early in sanctum. Cost legible in "painstaking" labor, reconfiguring options from frayed rope to resonant instrument.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aurora and sanctum constrain craft via infusing energy and mirroring internal shift from chill to ardor, charging final glow; sensory hierarchy vivid and purposeful. Recurring aurora evolution ties to closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early but remains abstract; single tightening at card fit and pluck narrows to success without visceral trade-off or opposition. Pressure coheres accumulatively but lacks on-page complication testing commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory preservation emerges organically from particulars like rope hum; final packing image offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in aurora-names connection lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in craft-focused noticing; rhythmic texture modulates but elevated diction like "snowmelt ardor" occasionally drifts from lexicon. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("as she worked," aurora pulsing) and paraphrase redundancy in process beats dull propulsion; overwriting in "otherworldly energy" stacks without payoff. Density functional but scaffold drags mid-section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh premise synthesis of rope-braiding instrument, punched card, and aurora-memory preservation transforms craft trope organically. Risk in unorthodox method heightens ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
