<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Abstract interiority relies on label-speak like "feral nostalgia" and "jaded wonder" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices during pivotal writing immersion; unearned epiphany shift to peace lacks prior causal pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dream density builds to on-page CR closure ("distilled chaos into narrative...found a sense of peace"), with legible emotional cost in transformed regret; orientation anchored early in cabin, one softening via cabin fade/return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll handled tactilely and charges final image as "glowing" testament, subtly mirroring internal shift; generic woods/cabin lack sensory narrowing or choice constraint under introspective pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of recording dreams deepens accumulatively through immersive writing, reweighting confusion to clarity with bittersweet cost; lacks sharp option foreclosure or agency-driven reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of creativity catalyzing nostalgia emerges implicitly via scroll's evolution, with resonant CR final image reweighting pain to purpose without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with introspective perceptual signature biased toward dream chronicler lens; rhythmic repetition undercuts propulsion in reflective peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops ("felt a sense of" x5+, nostalgia/pain-to-peace churn) and template cadence ("As I [action/emotion]") across final third dull closure image; heavy scaffold obscures density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Feral nostalgia" and jealous past selves offer fresh angle on time/confusion, synthesized into scroll payoff; reflective arc remains somewhat templated without bold risk.</comment>
