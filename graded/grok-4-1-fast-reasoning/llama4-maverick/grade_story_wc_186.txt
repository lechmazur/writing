<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Generic interiority relies on stock phrases like "felt a shiver run down their spine" and "surge of determination" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; motivation told abstractly rather than clashing impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure at orrery spark ("a spark of light flared to life"), reconfiguring pavilion's resonance with felt cost of collapse; orientation anchored early in pavilion and custodian role; one tightening via shard-clutching path suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "vibrations attuning to the rhythm of their footsteps" and "sweet scent of thistle" integrate into action, mirroring internal quest and constraining path via wall-etched star charts; recurring pavilion hum evolves causally to charge final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rekindling knowledge tightens accumulatively via shard-to-orrery progression, narrowing to orrery touch with felt cost of "tiny, shattered world"; agency via endurance shows in steadfast pursuit, though pressure remains mostly internal without sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of meaning in coincidences emerges organically through particulars like prism shard and star paths reweighting collapse into hope; final golden light offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, charging prior quest images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature in biased noticing of vibrations and glints; rhythmic prose modulates effectively, consistent diction suits post-collapse lyricism without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Poetic rhythm varies but "felt" repetition across interior beats ("felt a shiver", "felt a surge", "felt their heart lift") creates minor template cadence and paraphrase loops in hope descriptions, dulling peak density without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-collapse lyric quest with inventive images like "shard of hush" and humming pavilion transforming tropes; risk in accumulative texture heightens stakes organically toward inevitable orrery reconfiguration.</comment>
