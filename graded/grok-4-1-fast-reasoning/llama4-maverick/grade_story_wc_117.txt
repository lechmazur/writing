<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Aria's motivation as music therapist is consistent and drives her actions, but lacks contradictory impulses or embodied internal conflict; Eli applies mild secondary pressure but remains archetypal. Final satisfaction feels earned via buildup yet borders on unearned epiphany in "she had done her job." Therapy-speak like "tap into the subtle rhythms" dilutes specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density building to Charged Poise RR closure at eclipse peak with Eli's awe reconfiguring connection; orientation anchors early at Sage Ridge. One tightening via Eli's arrival deepens stake, but minimal causality or opposition limits to strong mid-band. Closure cost felt in fragile beauty, legible in "world's beauty was fragile and easily lost."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like "sage-scented breeze" and eclipse progression are selective, POV-filtered via Aria's musical attunement, and constrain the shared moment. Recurring guitar and ridge integrate into action; micro-setting charges final image without overwriting. Strong economy fits single scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of nurturing Eli's wonder signaled early, but no meaningful tightening or reversal narrows options; peaceful buildup lacks pressure or cost test under Accumulative lens. Eli's presence complicates mildly but resolves without trade-off. Static harmony undercuts escalation to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ordinary magic theme emerges via eclipse/music images, with subtext in fragile wonder; final image of Eli's gratitude offers non-literal resonance. Some thematic echo in "nurture lifelong wonder" abstracts rather than layering complexity. Earned from particulars but resists tidy moral weakly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV on Aria with lyrical perceptual signature in rhythmic noticing of nature/music; voice modulates poetically without head-hopping. No dialogue to judge. Compression of eclipse suits Accumulative texture, consistent to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in wonder/connection phrasing ("sense of connection," "linked him") and repetitive "ordinary magic" create mild churn, dulling density; template cadence in descriptive openings like "As [event]" across sentences. Rhythm varies but figurative density overwrites high beats without payoff. Closure image clear despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Sentimental therapist-kid-at-eclipse inspirational arc feels template-derived without fresh inflection; eclipse as wonder catalyst is familiar without transformation. Keepsake curl adds minor particularity, but overall middle-ground safety hedges risk.</comment>
