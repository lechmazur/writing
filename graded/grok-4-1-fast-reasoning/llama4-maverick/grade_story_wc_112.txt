<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation to prove sideways time theory is consistent but lacks contradictory impulses or flaws complicating choices; interiority relies on generic "felt a sense of" phrasings like satisfaction and awe without embodied contradiction. No real struggle or micro-choices under pressure beyond smooth success. Change in wonder feels told, not earned through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with repair → activation → nexus → touch → time shift → return as clear because/therefore chain to CR closure; orientation anchored early in station/lab. Closure lands on-page with tingling hands and reconfigured view as conceptual cost in final return beat. Minor slip: shift too frictionless without opposition tightening options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like blue holographic glow and iridescent mist integrate purposefully, filtering through Kaelin's mechanic priorities; station/simulator constrain action via repair/tools. Recurring "icy warmth" mirrors internal shift and charges final image. Some generic sci-fi placeholders dilute vividness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove time theory) signaled early via data poring, tightens once at nexus touch narrowing to proof, but escalation mild under causal lens with no live option foreclosed or trade-off. Agency present in choices, but no reversal tests commitment; success too unopposed. Cost legible only obliquely in reluctance to return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of sideways time discovery emerges organically from nexus experiment and creature connection, resonating in final "icy warmth of discovery" image reweighting reality's veil without moralizing. Subtext in hush of wings motif shifts from rest to purpose. Complexity lingers in infinite possibilities.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in mechanical precision and wonder; voice texture modulates via poetic repetitions like "hush of beating wings." No head-hopping or withholding; diction fits mechanic's lexicon. Minor register elevation in epiphanies stays voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("felt a sense of" twice; "icy warmth" overused across beats) and template cadence in satisfaction/awe/wonder progressions dull propulsion, especially pre-climax. Repetitive phrasing like "mechanically warm hands" creates synonym churn. Closure image muddled slightly by redundancy; rhythm varies but lacks density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of holographic nexus replicating twilight phenomenon for sideways time proof transforms sci-fi tropes via mechanic's theory. Sideways time and winged torpor connection feels organic. No close famous echoes; risk in quiet CR ending heightens wonder.</comment>
