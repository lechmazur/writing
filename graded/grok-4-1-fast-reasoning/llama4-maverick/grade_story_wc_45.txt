<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Unearned epiphanies dominate with label-speak like "forgiving skeptic" and "shrewdly innocent gaze"; no contradictory impulses act in scene to compel change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with conceptual repricing closure via newfound purpose and glowing tooth; orientation clear early, but minimal tightening weakens drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid secret garden details filter through Emilia's wonder; recurring tooth constrains realization and charges final image effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Internal stake of clarity deepens accumulatively to charged poise, but abstract pressure lacks on-page trade-off or visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of nostalgia-innovation emerges but direct echoes like "turn mistakes into constellations" (repeated) replace resonance with thesis statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature of wonder; voice coherent but minor repetition dulls rhythm under reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive loops ("sense of" x6, purpose/nostalgia paraphrase chains) and synonym churn kill density; artifacts pervade reflective beats including near-closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Changeling tooth inflects realization freshly, but introspective garden epiphany arc remains familiar without bold transformation.</comment>
