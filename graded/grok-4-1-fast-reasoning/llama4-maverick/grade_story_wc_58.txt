<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Consistent motivation to heal via writing, but interiority leans diagnostic without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; epiphanies like "a sense of understanding wash over me" feel unearned, lacking embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to garden transformation; CR closure via snapped thread reconfigures fragility with felt cost in puff of dust and acceptance; orientation anchored early in deserted town/garden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory palette (damp earth, decaying leaves) filters through melancholic POV; palace carpet weft thread as micro-setting charges final image, constraining reverent touch and snap.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (geography of healing) signaled early but remains abstract; minimal textural tightening via writing beat narrows to acceptance without live option foreclosure or agency-driven trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of fragile connections emerges organically from thread motif shifting to snapped release; resonant CR final image offers non-literal healing answer, but counter-readings limited by sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with poetic perceptual signature; rhythmic modulation suits introspection, but occasional elevated diction drifts from traveler's grounded lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops (silence/absences/shadows across paragraphs) create paraphrase drag; overwriting in reflections like "fading light casting long, melancholic shadows" dulls propulsion without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh obituaries-for-living premise transforms melancholy trope via thread symbol; final snap offers earned inflection, though vignette structure hedges bold risk.</comment>
