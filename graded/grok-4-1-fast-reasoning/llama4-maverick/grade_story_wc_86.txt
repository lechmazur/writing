<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sparse interiority with stock phrasing like "sense of calm determination"; no contradictory impulses or flaws complicating on-page choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with motif density to Charged Poise closure (pocketing pull amid fragile balance); orientation anchored early, but progress told via summary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist and parapet constrain atmosphere and charge final image; sensory details (sighing wind, cool metal) mirror emotional states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiation breakthrough) signaled early but lacks on-page tightening or reversal under textural lens; abstract pressure with no visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of recycling mistakes emerges but undermined by direct statements like "recycle their mistakes into wisdom"; lacks subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with biased noticing (mist as entity); rhythmic prose modulates, minimal dialogue natural; capped by Q7 artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("mist swirling," drawer pull recitals) and synonym churn dull density; template cadence in emotional beats pervades final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of moon-sync negotiation and drawer pull symbol transforms trope; risk in unorthodox method heightens premise organically.</comment>
