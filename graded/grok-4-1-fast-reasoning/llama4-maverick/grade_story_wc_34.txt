<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Vague interiority relies on repetitive poetic labels like "tinkersong wonder" without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; no genuine flaws or micro-choices under pressure undermine earned change. Self-discovery epiphany in final survey feels unearned and abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from calm observation to frenzied art amid storm, delivering charged poise closure in mural completion and ethereal breeze response; orientation anchors early, one tightening via intensifying storm suffices with felt cost in attunement and departure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (wet stone/ozone scent, fog tendrils, storm electricity) filter through POV and charge final image, with courtyard subtly enabling encoding; recurring mist evolves causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to connect via art signaled early and deepens via storm frenzy narrowing to response; agency in encoding drives one meaningful accumulative tightening with legible cost in self-truth and courtyard change, though external pressure remains atmospheric over visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of creative expression bridging living/ghostly emerges organically from graffiti process and final mural, offering resonant non-literal answer in lingering song and changed courtyard without moralizing; ambiguity in connection invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in mystical sensory bias and consistent poetic texture; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly, though minor repetitive phrasing slightly dulls peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("seemed to", "swirling", "as she") and paraphrase redundancy across descriptive beats create template cadence, dulling propulsion; overwriting with metaphors in every frenzied art sentence obscures closure image clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-in-code with graffiti encoding in cloud courtyard transforms mystical tropes through lived poetic process; risk-taking in accumulative lyric design heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
