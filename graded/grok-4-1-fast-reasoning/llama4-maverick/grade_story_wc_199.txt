<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Minimal interior conflict or contradictory impulses; emotions told via stock phrases like "heart filled with a sense of wonder" without embodiment; transformation feels declared rather than earned through micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure ("emerge transformed" reconfigures self/arbor with fragile hush cost); orientation anchored early in arbor/seed sorter; lacks tightening turn narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (shimmering bark, rustling leaves) integrated into action; arbor subtly guides decoding via falling leaves; repetition dulls but doesn't obscure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode prophecy) signaled early with speck/pattern tightening under accumulative lens; no opposition or visible cost beyond vague "fragile balance"; agency passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of hushed transformation emerges via leaf patterns and monuments; resonant final image reweights past/prophecy without moralizing; lacks complexity or counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (misty wonder); rhythmic modulation supports atmosphere; no dialogue; minor repetition erodes distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("moonstone cabochon dust speck" overused, "emerge transformed" echoed, glow/radiance churn); template cadence in repetitive beats; artifacts pervade, dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fresh skyborne arbor synthesis with folklore infuses originality; generic wonder arc and purple tendencies limit; risk in lyric accumulation pays off modestly.</comment>
