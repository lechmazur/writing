<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Abstract motivation lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; turner's "quietly inspired soul" feels labeled, not revealed through flawed actions; no earned change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, closure as CR reconfigures prophecy via final image, but lacks decisive density increase or cadence shift; static scene with no tightening forecloses options weakly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (scent of aged wood, harp hum) reflects POV priorities; amber warehouse and cliffs subtly mirror internal states, charging final golden light image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover patterns) signaled early but remains abstract; no agency-driven reversal or deepening narrows options under lens; cost felt obliquely in ongoing work, not viscerally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of shared wisdom emerges implicitly from canyon echo weaving buttons/hourglasses; final image offers resonant CR without moralizing, though complexity leans platitudinous.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with mystical perceptual signature; rhythm modulates contemplative intensity; no head-hopping, purposeful compression legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("unraveled," "threads," "whispers") and repetitive stems across descriptive runs dull propulsion; overwriting metaphors obscure clarity in key revelatory beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hourglass turner cataloging buttons transforms memory/tropes into prophecy-weaving; buttons as "keys to narratives" feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
