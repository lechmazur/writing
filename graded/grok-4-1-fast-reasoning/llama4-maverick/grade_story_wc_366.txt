<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Solid consistency in reticent, observant traits shown through noticing glass and stones, but interiority leans abstract with repeated "luminescent ache" lacking embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; final resolve feels unearned without prior internal conflict testing the protect motive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations densify toward Charged Poise closure in final sailing image with felt emotional cost of enduring ache; orientation anchored early in lantern room post-lamp-out; one tightening via stone-stacking reconfigures safety longing without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sea glass and cairn as micro-settings constrain choices and charge final image; sensory details (chill air, warming glass) filtered through observant POV mirror internal ache purposefully; spatial choreography clear from lantern descent to shore without white-room vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bottling safety amid darkness accumulates density under Textural lens with stone-stacking as agency-driven deepening that crystallizes endurance; cost legible in accepted ache, but lacks live option foreclosure to fully narrow tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of haunted safety emerges organically from glass/cairn motifs shifting to resonant dawn-spread ache in ending without moralizing; subtext in watchful lighthouse invites lingering ambiguity on protection's sorrowful price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature of glow/ache observations; rhythmic prose modulates meditative intensity purposefully; no head-hopping or withholding, voice lyrical yet legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with visual propulsion but minor paraphrase loops on "glow/seemed to glow" and "luminescent ache" repetitions dull density in closing beats; figurative language purposeful yet overwrites peak stacking without coherence loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sea glass/cairn as ache vessels transforms lighthouse tropes via Textural build; resolve in sailing image feels earned hindsight, but risks meditative stasis over bold ingenuity.</comment>
