<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Naomi's archivist motivation drives the search but lacks contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; Ada's emergence forces minimal relational interaction, but no crucible tests traits with cost. Interiority relies on vague embodiment like "heart still ablaze" without degradation or flaws complicating the parley.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from diary path to library encounter and parley insight, anchoring orientation early in zeppelin interior; closure as Charged Poise in bound quest with lagoon reminder holds, but no meaningful tightening forecloses options—the diary yields without on-page causal struggle or visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "scent of aged paper and the soft hum of the zeppelin's engines" filter through archivist POV and guide navigation to the window; obsidian lagoon as recurring micro-setting draws inexplicable connection, mirroring secrets and charging the ending vista.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of diary truth signaled early but remains abstract without opposition or reversal; parley offers insight without narrowing options, agency, or felt price under Accumulative lens—no cadence shift reweights stakes with cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of past/present truths emerges from diary path, debris patterns, and lagoon mirror without moralizing; resonant reconfiguration in "bound together by their quest" answers search via charged image of ongoing mystery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature on archival textures and hypnotic rhythms; lyrical diction like "messages that seemed to dance in the dim light" modulates accumulatively, though unquoted "hushed tones" limits dialogue subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "felt" (drawn/felt spark/connection) and "secrets" across sentences dull density; overwrought "searing reverie" and "heart still ablaze" strain figurative coherence in late beats without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of zeppelin library, retrocognitive debris rituals, and subterranean lagoon transforms archival trope into surreal textural drive; risk in beach debris amid airship pays off in hypnotic messages charging closure.</comment>
