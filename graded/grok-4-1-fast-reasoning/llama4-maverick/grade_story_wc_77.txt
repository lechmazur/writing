<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's curiosity and dread are embodied but generic (e.g., repeated shudders), lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; advisor voice motivates turns without deep interior contradiction. Final change feels earned via accumulation but not character-particular flaws complicating peak choice at mirror.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of whispers and luminance builds to CR closure in awakening, with felt cost of inescapable haunting ("forever marked"). Orientation anchored early in funhouse entry; one tightening at mirror suffices, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (decay reek, pulsing clasp, warped mirror) mirrors dread and guides progression through corridors; funhouse constrains choices without spatial drift. Recurring luminance charges final faded image, qualifying 9-band under micro-setting rule.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harness luminance vs. fear/allure) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via insistent voice and mirror reveal narrowing options; cost legible in vortex draw and forever-marked endurance. Protagonist agency in pressing on tests commitment with visible dread price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of inescapable allure emerges organically from cursed image callbacks and final beckoning refrain, reweighting premise without moralizing. Resonant CR in departing yet haunted image answers fear-tricking question non-literally; ambiguity lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with dread-biased perceptual signature (e.g., writhing words); rhythmic build modulates tension purposefully. Voice texture distinct in horror lyricism, no head-hopping or withholding; compression taught early pays off at blackout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("whispering advisor's voice" x12, lingering/beckoning refrains) and synonym churn (shudder/shiver/dread) dull propulsion, especially in mirror beat; template cadence in sequential "As I [action]" runs triggers -1.2. Closure image muddied slightly by redundancy, capping high-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Funhouse tropes transformed mildly by luminance/clasp synthesis, but haunted carnival frame and advisor voice echo genre standards without bold risk; final whisper turn feels inevitable from pattern yet not strikingly fresh.</comment>
