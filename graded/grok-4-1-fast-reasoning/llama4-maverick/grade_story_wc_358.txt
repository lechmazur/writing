<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation told via labels like "driven by a desire to cultivate foresight in action" without embodied micro-choices under pressure; interiority hazy and repetitive, lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with observation density building to Conceptual Repricing closure ("sense of clarity wash over her"); one tightening via wind patterns insight narrows implications, cost felt in ongoing commitment; orientation anchored early, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Selective sensory details like "rust and saltwater," "swirling and eddying" wind integrate with action; labyrinth constrains navigation at "narrow juncture" and charges final image of secrets "laid bare."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding crash signaled early but remains observational without agency-driven reversal; accumulative pressure via wind complexity tightens slightly, but abstract stakes lack visceral cost at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of complex causality in disasters emerges organically from survey and patch; final image of emerging into sunlight offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, though some pseudo-profundity like "hazy precision" borders platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with consistent investigative perceptual bias; rhythmic texture modulates with scene but drifts to abstract phrasing; no dialogue, no issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn ("silence... oppressive," repeated "sense of," "reminder") across survey beats dull density; template cadence in repetitive stems like "The [noun] seemed..." triggers -0.6; artifacts pervade but spare closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on crash investigation via wind in container maze transforms tropes through specifics; lacks bold risk, feels safely observational without non-obvious synthesis at realization.</comment>
