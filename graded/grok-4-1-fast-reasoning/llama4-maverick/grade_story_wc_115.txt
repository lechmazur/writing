<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Motivation to uncover truth is consistent but abstract; interiority relies on stock shivers and heartbeats without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. No earned change, as final clarity feels unmotivated by prior micro-choices. Skepticism mentioned but doesn't constrain actions under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with sensory density building to CR closure via logbook discovery; orientation anchored early in tunnel. One tightening at cryptic entry narrows to satisfaction, but linkages meander without persistent constraint. Cost legible in "weight... beginning to reveal itself."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sensory details like "heavy with... decay and rust" and echoing footsteps vividly integrate, mirroring internal curiosity and pressing choices via darkness. Beaded wheel and logbook as micro-settings charge discoveries without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking truth signaled early, escalates accumulatively via radio to logbook with one deepening that changes knowledge. Low agency in passive stumbling; abstract stakes lack visceral trade-off, but final clarity forecloses uncertainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths emerges organically from valve, radio, and logbook, resonating in final "clarity wash over them" without statement. Subtext in skepticism vs. watched feeling adds ambiguity; reweights exploration premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward decay and vibrations; rhythmic texture modulates drowsily. Repetitive phrasing like repeated "echoing" slightly erodes distinction under building alertness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in "sense of... wash over them" (twice) and clutched wheel reiterations dull propulsion across final third. Template cadence in descriptive sentences ("felt a sense of") creates synonym churn; density low in reflective stretches.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Beaded valve on train car offers fresh inflection on decay motif, transforming exploration trope slightly. Core arc remains standard abandoned-site realization without bold risks or hindsight inevitability.</comment>
