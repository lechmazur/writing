<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; interiority relies on generic abstractions like "razor edges of time" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Motivation stated repetitively but lacks intensification compelling higher-stakes actions. Final endurance feels unearned without prior causal buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with introspective density building to Charged Poise in dawn vigilance; orientation anchored early at station. Closure via Conceptual Repricing reconfigures time's mystery with felt cost of eternal watchfulness in final lines. Lacks one decisive tightening or cadence shift narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sensory details like "fjord quiet" and reeds selective but repetitive; clocks and key as micro-setting constrain monitoring task. Horizon subtly guides gaze and alignment habit. No object charges final image decisively for 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding time) signaled early but static with no textural deepening or reversal narrowing options; introspection loops without pressure growth. No protagonist agency foreclosing path with on-page cost under lens. Vigilance as endurance lacks visible price alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme of time's precision vs. chaos emerges repetitively from counting and clocks but through assertion over particulars. Final image offers quiet resonance without reweighting prior material non-literally. Avoids moralizing but lacks ambiguity or counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single POV stable with time-obsessed perceptual signature; voice modulates poetically but drifts to elevated diction clashing with serene tone. No head-hopping or elision issues. Rhythmic consistency undermined by Q7 repetition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("counting continued" x2, repetitive "shepherd stood/eyes fixed"); template cadence in descriptive runs (e.g., clock mechanisms whirred/ticking sequences). Overwriting with redundant motifs dulls propulsion; −1.2 artifacts in reflective beats obscure density. Heavy debt caps high bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh premise of hydraulic clock shepherd transforms time tropes through hydraulic/horizon specificity. Original synthesis of introspection and station vigilance feels organic. Minor hedging in static stakes prevents higher band.</comment>
