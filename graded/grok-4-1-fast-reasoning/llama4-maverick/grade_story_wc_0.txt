<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Maria's interiority relies on abstract philosophizing ("intricate patterns that governed the universe") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; neutron star expertise feels tacked on via summary links rather than driving scene actions. No internal conflict or flawed impulses act simultaneously; endurance of humility lacks prior causal buildup or visible cost. Passive observation dominates, revealing no hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of reflective images building to CR closure in final lines ("world... always in a state of becoming"), reweighting destruction into beauty with conceptual cost of limited understanding. Single scene anchored early (greenhouse post-flood by para 2). No meaningful tightening or beat; static progression lacks density increase or pattern break to narrow options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Storm-damaged greenhouse vividly sensory (damp earth scent, grimy panes, debris floor) and mirrors internal states via decay/settled sediment, constraining examination of butterfly wing sample. Micro-setting (wing/dust) charges realization without overt symbolism. Selective POV filter (scientific scanning) integrates into action; spatial coherence clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>No dominant stake signaled early with coherent pressure; abstract "understanding gradual change" lacks escalation, reversal, or agency-driven narrowing under Accumulative lens. No visible cost alters tactics—realization feels free of trade-off. Static reflection without interweaving conflicts or moral calculus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of gradual change/deca as creative emerges from dust/settled patterns, with final image ("unfolding its secrets") offering non-literal resonance via CR. Direct statements ("decay was not just a destructive force, but also a creative one") verge on thematic echo, reducing subtext; complexity absent amid tidy affirmation. Recurring dust motif charges ending but feels imposed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with consistent perceptual signature (scientific bias toward "intricate patterns"); voice modulates slightly toward humility at end. Elevated diction fits researcher but risks academic register drift. Rhythmic control solid, no head-hopping; purposeful compression in reflections legible under lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops dominate ("gradual change" x8, "intricate patterns/web" x6, "dust... reminder" reprises), creating template cadence and synonym churn that dulls propulsion across final third. Density low with redundant stems ("As she..."); figurative muddle in "dance between chaos and order" clashes with peak reflection. Closure image softened by repetition artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neutron stars, butterfly dust, and greenhouse decay transforms meditative trope via specific scientific lens. Risk in abstract lyricism heightens conceptual stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passes narrowly—core arc relies on familiar epiphany frame.</comment>
