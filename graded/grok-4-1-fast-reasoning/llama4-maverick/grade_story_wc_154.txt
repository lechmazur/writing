<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak dominates interiority ("graft new meaning onto old wounds," "lotus-hearted ache") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; unearned epiphany flattens motivation at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with gradual density build from coral study to mist-clearing RR (Charged Poise) at end; orientation anchored early, one tightening via decrypting amid haze; cost felt in emotional ache but lacks sharp reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mist and twilight evolve purposefully, mirroring internal shift from turmoil to peace ("mist that was slowly clearing"); coral constrains attention and charges final image; sensory hierarchy fits translator's perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unknot anxieties) signaled early with accumulative deepening via decrypting cast's resilience message; agency in pressing on despite anesthetic haze, but escalation remains textural without narrowing options sharply; cost legible in chest ache but abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Shared anxieties emerge organically through coral/cast images shifting to healing; resonant final coral pulse reweights turmoil-to-beauty without moralizing; pseudo-profundity in platitude-like phrasing ("power of hope and resilience") dilutes complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern-decrypting lens; voice poetic but drifts to elevated register ("ethereal glow"); no dialogue; compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound ("thoughts grew hazy... vision began to blur"; "unknot... unraveling"; "anxieties" x5); synonym churn and repetitive stems dull closure image (final coral/mist reprise); heavy artifacts cap propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fresh translator-decrypting child's cast amid anesthetic yields specific synthesis, transforming conflict-zone trope; lacks bold risk, leans templated lyric healing; hinges on coral's inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
