<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>No concrete interiority or contradictory impulses; traits like "weaves truth carefully" told without micro-choices under pressure; abstract emotions lack embodiment, flattening change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with visionary density to Charged Poise closure ("windows of connection had swung open"); cost legible in "weight of her task," but no meaningful tightening narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (melting ice scent, candle shadows) and snow globe constrain visionary beats; glacier shrine charges final image without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stake ("salvage something pure") signaled early but abstract; no reversal or agency-driven deepening under Accumulative lens, leaving pressure static.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Connections theme emerges organically from visions and snow globe reprise, offering resonant reconfiguration without statement; fragile beauty lingers plausibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (ethereal biases); rhythmic modulation fits visionary mode, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("weight of her mission," repeated light/glow descriptions) and synonym churn dull density; figurative overload lacks payoff in visionary beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh wreck-diver ghost whisperer premise transformed via glacial visions; organic synthesis heightens mystical stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
