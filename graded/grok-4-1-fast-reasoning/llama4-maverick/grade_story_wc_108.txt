<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in opening tremble and decryption drive, with contradictory impulses (phobias vs. adaptive push) acting in scene; final renunciation of hiding earned by code-crack causality. Minor slips in diagnostic phrasing like "vulnerability is power" reduce peak authenticity without touching closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: search → seashell discovery → decryption → "truth in the shadows" CR with felt cost of emerging. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored in first line; one tightening via code-crack suffices, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Selective sensory anchors (dusty shelves, stars twinkling) filter through phobia lens, constraining search; seashell as micro-setting handled tactilely and charges final hum. Final stars mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcome post-betrayal fears) signaled early, accumulative escalation via deepening realization narrows hiding option; agency in decrypting forecloses doubt with legible emotional cost at "trembling certainty."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability powering emergence arises organically from particulars (shadows message, seashell hum); final image reconfigures shadows motif resonantly. Direct assertions like "vulnerability is power" verge on stating over implying.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable first-person POV with perceptual signature (phobia-tinged noticing of trembles, shadows); rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; minor paraphrase loops ("firmly adaptive" repeats) and synonym churn in reflections dull mid-section without obscuring end. No filter stacks or figurative muddle in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Quirky synthesis of stunt double phobias, child's cast decryption, and seashell hum transforms introspection tropes; "truth in the shadows" turn feels inevitable from library search.</comment>
