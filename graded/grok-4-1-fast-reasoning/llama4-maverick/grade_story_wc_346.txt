<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority poetic but abstract with label-speak like "bruised awe"; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or embodied micro-choices under pressure, though motivation to protect balance endures credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with hush density building to charged poise closure; final puppet-to-lips whisper reconfigures fragility into endurance with felt burden cost legible in "weight of their task settling upon them."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass pane and dusk hush vividly constrain perception and charge final shimmer; sensory hush mirrors internal fragility purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of balance preservation deepens accumulatively via hush intensification and weight; agency in adjustments/lullaby forecloses imbalance with burden cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fragility-to-endurance theme emerges via puppet reprise; final "broken puppet head... testament to the enduring power" offers resonant CR reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with reverent perceptual signature; hush repetition taught early modulates rhythm purposefully toward closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Hush motif creates purposeful pattern but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "hush" fissures/stillness) and figurative density dull propulsion; no filter stacks but synonym churn borders artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh doomsday adjuster/puppet synthesis transforms cosmic fragility trope; sustained hush lyricism risks boldly, heightening closure ingenuity.</comment>
