<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; interiority concrete but reflective summaries dominate over micro-choices under pressure, flattening motivation to declarative resolve without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with subway shards building density to CR closure ("clover melancholy slowly give way"); legible transitions and one tightening via scrawl phrase, but minimal causal pressure narrows options softly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Recurring mica pane lantern charges final image as symbol of shifting boundaries; sensory details (rain melody, musty scent) selective and mirror internal states without stalling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (help father) signaled early with one accumulative deepening via scrawls, but escalation lacks agency-driven narrowing or visible trade-off; abstract addiction quest feels untested on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of paradoxes emerges organically from probability insights and scrawls; final lantern image offers resonant CR repricing without moralizing, though "lucid contradictions" edges overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (symbolic graffiti, glinting mica); rhythmic modulation suits reflective tone, no head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("candle lantern... mica pane" recurs 6x verbatim-ish; "glow/shine brighter" x3) and synonym churn ("purpose and resolve/determination") dull closure image; template cadence in reflective beats triggers −1.7.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of probability theory, subway scrawls, and addiction via "lucid contradictions"; transforms tropes through particular symbols, but "clover melancholy" feels contrived without payoff.</comment>
