<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Traits like titan-gear enhancements and moon fluctuations are labeled but not revealed through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; no internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene, leaving motivation abstract and unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from descriptive layers to Charged Poise closure in final image of guardian preserving wonder; legible single-scene pattern taught early, on-page cost in "relentless passage of time," but beats too thin for elite propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration of tidal atrium (saltwater scent, lapping waves) filters through POV and charges final image via creel's shimmering objects mirroring preserved wonders; recurring sea motifs constrain perception purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>No early dominant stake faces on-page tightening or reversal under Accumulative lens; abstract preservation of wonder lacks pressure, agency, or visible cost narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of fluid identities emerges organically from tidal/moon images but weakened by direct tells like "migrating identities... flowed like the tides"; final guardian image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct tidal/perceptual signature in syntax and metaphor; rhythmic modulation suits lyric mode, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variety and density, but paraphrase loops in fluidity repetitions (e.g., tides/ebbs across paragraphs) and minor synonym churn dull propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh titan-gear/tidal fusion transforms librarian archetype into fluid guardian premise; risk-taking in lyric fantasy synthesis feels organic and inevitable in final reconfiguration.</comment>
