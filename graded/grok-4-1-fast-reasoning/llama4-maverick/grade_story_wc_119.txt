<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Label-only traits like "accidentally prophetic nature" repeated without embodied micro-choices or contradictory impulses in scene; no earned change shown through actions under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred but fails to build density or cadence shift; repetitive summaries create and-then drift without tightening; vague CR closure ("life would never be the same") lacks legible on-page cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Lighthouse and rocky island provide atmosphere but no constraint on choices; selective night-to-dawn sensory details integrated sparsely into telling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>No dominant stake signaled early; stranger's arrival introduces no coherent pressure, escalation, or narrowing of options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets emerges via repetition but lacks resonant non-literal answer; final image of writing under lighthouse recharges nothing specific.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Consistent single POV with mystical texture but repetitive syntax erodes perceptual signature; no dialogue to distinguish voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("directing the flow," "transpose their life into a new key," "accidentally prophetic") across paragraphs obscure propulsion; template cadence in repeated Oracle phrases dulls all beats, including closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Quirky premise (fortune writer + microdot specs) offers fresh angle but undercut by clichéd mystical tropes and repetitive execution without bold transformation.</comment>
