<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear but declarative and repetitive without intensifying via contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; interiority relies on stock phrases like "surge of determination" and "deep-seated motivation" without embodied contradiction; final shift to patience feels told, not earned through scene actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build in motifs (moon, viaduct hum) to charged poise closure (energy surge, revolution begins) with conceptual cost of reconfigured freedom; orientation anchored early; minor drag from static progression without reversal, but one cadence tightening at night climax suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (snow crunch, cold air, viaduct gleam/hum) filters through mapper's priorities, subtly guiding edgeward movement; viaduct/lake evolve causally with events, mirroring internal states; recurring viaduct charges buildup but does not constrain pivotal choice, barring 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (spark revolution) signaled early with accumulative pressure growth to hand-raising agency; one deepening (hum/wind intensification) narrows to climax, but abstract opposition lacks visceral on-page test or visible trade-off cost, leaving stakes declarative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of patient revolution emerges organically from moon-tracking, viaduct surge, final glowing lake image reweighting impatience to sculpted peace without moralizing; resonance in particulars avoids platitudes; Q4 pressure limits higher band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual bias toward celestial/energy motifs; voice texture poetic and consistent but repetitive phrasing dulls under pressure; Q7 debt caps at 7.6.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops ("sense of purpose/determination/resolve/pride") and template cadence ("She felt a [emotion], knowing...") across buildup create synonym churn dulling propulsion; repetitive "softly purposeful" and "she stood/knew/felt" stems fail read-aloud variety; artifacts touch closure buildup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystic mapper igniting "patient revolution" via moon/viaduct transforms revolution trope into textural lyric buildup; particular images (rain-gleam on viaduct, frozen sea) feel organic and memorable without gimmickry.</comment>
