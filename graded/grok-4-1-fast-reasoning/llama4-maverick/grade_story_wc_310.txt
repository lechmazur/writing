<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Label-only traits like "quietly enthusiastic" dominate without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; interiority abstracts cosmic harmony ("wavelength of their being align") rather than dramatizing impulses. No internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene. Final alignment feels unearned without prior causal buildup of flaws or costs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from coins/static to distillation drink; on-page Charged Poise closure ("wavelength...align") reconfigures cosmic role with lingering "stellar doubt" as conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early (who/where/when by para 1). One tightening via distillation reveals prophecy, but linkages feel summary-like without motivated ellipsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ambered deck and coins integrate tactilely ("poured a small vial...distillation apparatus"), mirroring internal thrill via scents ("sweet, pungent aroma...tang of starlight"). Recurrent stars constrain gazing/distillation choices and charge final image. Sensory selection purposeful but visually dominant; no major spatial choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher prophecy/align wavelength) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via static/distillation to Charged Poise; cost legible in "stellar doubt" persisting post-alignment. Pressure coherent but abstract/cosmic, lacking visceral trade-off or live option foreclosed on-page beyond harmony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic connection emerges organically from particulars (coins/static to droplet drink), final image ("gazed out...stellar doubt") offers non-literal resonance reweighting prophecy without moralizing. Avoids platitudes mostly, but pseudo-profound abstractions ("fabric of space-time...rewoven") dilute via generality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with cosmic perceptual signature ("twinkled like diamonds...velvet expanse"); rhythm modulates slightly to intensity at distillation. Elevated diction consistent but drifts to vague mysticism; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("decision maker" 15+ repeats; "backwards prophecy" 4x; satisfaction/stars twinkling redundantly across paras); template cadence in summary beats ("The [noun]...had become"). Overwriting muddles closure ("universe...more understandable"); artifacts dull propulsion throughout final third, capping density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Quirky synthesis of coins/static/distillation for cosmic alignment transforms prophecy trope via odd method, feeling organic to quiet enthusiasm. Final "stellar doubt" inflects fresh lingering cost. Risks cosmic abstraction but grounds in tactile process.</comment>
