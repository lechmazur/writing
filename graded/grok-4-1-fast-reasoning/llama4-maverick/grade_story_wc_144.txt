<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in artisan traits drives adjustments, but lacks contradictory impulses or embodied struggle; smooth success without micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values under pressure weakens depth, as in untroubled "final tweak."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building patterns of light/vibrations syncing to drone harmony; on-page RR (Charged Poise) lands in drone's steady hover and mist clearing with felt satisfaction cost, oriented clearly early; minor ambiguity in ship causality doesn't break closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration of mist, fountain rainbows, vibrations filters through blind POV to constrain calibration method; recurring light/mist charges final diffused light image after clearing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (drone calibration) signaled early with subtle tightening via pattern responses, but no reversal, narrowing, or visible trade-off under accumulative lens; steady success lacks coherent pressure foreclosing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of machine-environment harmony emerges organically from particulars like refraction and ship sync; final drone flight and brighter depot reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with blind-specific perceptual signature ("watched – not with her eyes, but with her entire being"); rhythmic prose modulates serenely, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("mist-coated rail depot," "light refracted through water features") and paraphrase redundancy in descriptive runs dull propulsion; overwriting in harmony motifs creates template cadence without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind artisan's refraction method transforms repair trope; rail/ship vibrations add ingenuity, feeling organic despite minor contrivance.</comment>
