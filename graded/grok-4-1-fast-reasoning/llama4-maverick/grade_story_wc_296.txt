<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Druid's motivation clear but abstractly told via summaries; interiority concrete in trepidation surge at frozen figure, yet epiphanies like "warlike serenity" repeat as labels without embodied contradiction in pivotal release moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure (mirror revelation reweights soul-truth with shaken-core cost on page); orientation anchored early in vortex entry; redundant walking beats dilute tightening before figure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (flowers/decay scent, spongy ground, writhing branches) pressures cautious steps and mirrors internal chaos; trees as micro-setting recur to charge path-reveal image without constraining choice directly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (soul-truth discovery) signaled early, deepens via agency in ice-touch to mirror crack; Accumulative escalation reweights via perception expansion, but cost (shaken core) abstract and lacks tactical alteration post-revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of soul-truth beyond mirrors emerges via cracking mirror image, but direct statements ("truth was both beautiful and terrifying") in climax reduce resonance; final path image offers non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias toward mystical signs (pulsating seed, watching trees); rhythmic modulation in revelation beat, but repetitive syntax ("As they...") erodes distinct texture under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("expanding perception/circles" x4, "warlike serenity" x3, path clears/unwinds) and template cadence in walking beats obscure momentum; revelation image dulled by redundant wonder summaries.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes (druid quest, cursed vortex, soul-mirror) transformed modestly via attribute-led discovery; mirror crack offers fresh inflection on reflection theme, but seed and figure feel templated without bold risk.</comment>
