<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Protectiveness embodied in "combative tenderness" and fervent annotations drives consistent motivation; confidence growth feels earned via easing tension. Trait "walking backwards" remains label-only without on-page constraint or trade-off, limiting specificity of flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup in tea-leaf discoveries tightening stake toward Charged Poise closure (triumphant smile, lingering gaze reconfiguring exile). Orientation anchored early; one meaningful deepening via hidden pattern suffices. Cost legible in subsiding anxiety, though subtle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Playground swing recurs to punctuate hush, charging final image; tea cup constrains precise work. Sensory details (dust motes, tea tang, creaks) selective via protective POV, mirroring internal easing. No white-room; lived-in choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reverse exile via annotation) signaled early, escalates texturally via pattern discovery narrowing options to quiet triumph. Agency in persistent work; felt cost in prior nervous tension foreclosed by subsiding habit. Coherent pressure under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Reversible exile and resilience emerge organically from annotation struggle and final reconfiguration, avoiding morals. Combative tenderness in movements layers theme of mentoring without sentiment. Final tea-leaf gaze reweights loss/longing non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature of sorrowful precision (eyes "hold a world of sorrow"); rhythmic modulation builds intensity. Poetic diction purposeful and consistent, no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("hush" thrice, "archivist's eyes/hands" repetitive stems) and minor synonym churn dull propulsion in mid-beats; template cadence in discovery runs (−0.6). Rhythm varies read-aloud, density high otherwise; no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shard-mirror archivist annotating soul-shadow via tea geometry transforms exile trope organically. Risky poetic conceit commits fully, heightening quiet stakes without gimmick.</comment>
