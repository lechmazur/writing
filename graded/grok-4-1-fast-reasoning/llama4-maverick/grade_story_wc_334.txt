<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; interiority relies on abstract summaries like "felt a sense of crisp nostalgia wash over her" without embodied micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred but no density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift; closure lacks legible cost in final resolve line ("She was ready to see it through"), failing cost proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration like "air heavy with damp earth and decaying fruit" mirrors internal states purposefully, though setting constrains path minimally in wading beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Stake to recover memories declared early but no tightening or agency-driven narrowing of options under Accumulative lens; static pressure with no on-page reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges from particulars like pulsing mushroom, but overt statements like "essential to be adaptable" dilute subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward folklore/astral details; rhythmic modulation supports introspection but lacks distinction under low pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops like repeated "felt a sense of" (3x) and "she knew that" across reflective beats dull propulsion; template cadence in final paragraphs with redundant determination phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sunken orchard folklore with astral patterns transforms tropes organically, though prose leans toward familiar literary introspection.</comment>
