<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via chalk reminder and statue affinity reveals character under pressure, but contradictory impulses feel summarized rather than simultaneous in scene; precognitive forgetfulness constrains mildly without strong tradeoffs; earned shift to peace via pattern completion shows motivation rooted in traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to pulsing pattern and fog's held breath; on-page CR closure as she feels the sound deeply with emotional cost of acceptance; orientation anchored early in garden; one tightening via completed arrangement suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog and gravel constrain path and charge final erasure image; sensory hierarchy (mist touch, crunch) reflects meditative urgency; statue reveal mirrors internal clinging; recurring fog evolves causally from swirling to closing, biasing POV toward echoes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture sound) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via pattern pulse forcing realization; agency in arranging forecloses physical search with felt emotional cost; fog complicates but coheres pressure to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of felt aging emerges via particulars like videotape hush shifting from oppressive to peaceful; final image reweights clinging echoes without moral; subtext in fog erasure invites ambiguity on loss; protagonist arc inextricable from tidal realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in chalk's smoothness and fog tendrils; rhythmic prose modulates from eerie calm to swelling heart; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in charged final stillness; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in ending ("found what searching for," peace repetitions) dull closure image by −0.8; fog "swirled" x3 creates template cadence; rhythm varies but overwriting metaphors (ethereal fingers) reduce density in peak; high info density otherwise propels.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of prophet seeking abstract sound via driftwood in fog garden feels inevitable; transforms memory tropes through textural aging; bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmick; fresh premise commits fully to implications.</comment>
