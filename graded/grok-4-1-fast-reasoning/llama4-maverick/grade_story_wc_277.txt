<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Motivation told via labels like "driven to discover hidden truths" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; no internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene. Epiphanies like "solemn playfulness gave way to a sense of purpose" feel unearned and abstract. Change to determination lacks prior causal buildup with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands as Charged Poise/CR via final image of dissipating "orbits of regret" with conceptual legacy cost legible in "one step closer to freeing her family." No Orientation Test penalty as anchors clear by paragraph 2. Lacks density increase or pattern break; static reflection without meaningful tightening weakens drive to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Observatory and clouds provide selective sensory swirl mirroring mind ("clouds outside seemed to swirl in tandem"), guiding descent choice subtly. Rosewood nib as micro-setting charges final glow image. Generic mystical veil clichés and visual overreliance limit vividness; no professional publishing details constrain despite heiress role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover scandal to save empire) signaled early but remains abstract without on-page test or reversal; no agency-driven tightening under lens narrows options. Pressure static, no felt loss alters tactics. "Proof by contradiction" mention too late for escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. regret emerges via repetitive "orbits of regret" shifting to purpose in final image, but overt statements like "the power of truth and the unyielding spirit" moralize. No subtext in gesture; ambiguity absent. Resonance from particulars weak due to abstract philosophizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward "devotedly observant eyes," but elevated diction repetitive ("sense of... wash over her" thrice). Voice texture poetic yet uniform; no dialogue. Perceptual signature selective but lacks modulation under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("orbits of regret" x6, "solemn playfulness" x2, "devotedly observant" x2) and synonym churn ("sense of calm/purpose/determination wash over" variations) pervade, dulling closure image; template cadence in repetitive sentence stems across final third. Density low with redundant telling; artifacts obscure propulsion. Read-aloud rhythm drumbeat-like.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Math proof in mystical observatory offers fresh inflection on heiress trope, with nib-pen heirloom tying publishing legacy. But trope transformation shallow; repetitive mysticism feels templated. Risk in "proof by contradiction" underused.</comment>
