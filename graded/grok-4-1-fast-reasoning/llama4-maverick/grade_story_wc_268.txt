<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Motivation told via summary ("patient work," "unwavering commitment") without on-page micro-choices or contradictory impulses; diminutive titan label ornamental, no embodied conflict. Interiority generic ("quiet confidence," "quiet excitement"). Final vanishing unearned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: accumulation of messages/patterns told over summarized months, not dramatized; closure as CR (pretender revealed, library changed) lands with conceptual cost in final image, but causality weakens via off-page work. Orientation anchored early. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory (parchment scent, candle shadows) integrated into action; library shelves constrain message-weaving. Atmosphere builds via "heavy with anticipation." Recurring ink pellet charges final discard image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmask pretender) signaled early under Accumulative lens, but no on-page tightening/reversal; pressure coherent via celestial pause but remains abstract, told via summaries. Cost felt in pretender's exposure, but lacks agency-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth's power emerges via message accumulation and revelation, resonant in changed library/CR ending without moralizing. Particulars (ink marks, rune) shift meaning subtly. Minor drift to platitude ("power of truth").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (focus on books/constellations); voice texture poetic yet consistent. Brief dialogue natural/subtextual ("gentle rebuke"). No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("cryptic messages," "woven narrative," "patient work" repeated 4+ times); template cadence in summary beats ("As the [time], Kael [action]"). Purple strains ("graceful collapse," mixed shadows/reality). Artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of titan in library intrigue with rune/ink, transforming tropes via textual conspiracy. Final vanishing reweights premise organically. Derivative elements (pretender unmasked) lack bold risk.</comment>
