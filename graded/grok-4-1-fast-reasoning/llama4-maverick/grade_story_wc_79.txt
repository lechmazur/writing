<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and rooted in curiosity despite unease, with embodied shiver at crack moment compelling higher-stakes step out; weakness in repetitive "quietly driven" labels reducing trait specificity without deeper contradictory impulses shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern deciphering causes crack revealing map, tightening to journey's Charged Poise closure when she blows whistle and steps toward looming watchers with dread cost legible; orientation anchored early in city on turtles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Shell patterns as micro-setting constrain cartographer's deciphering choice and charge crack discovery; sun and worn shells selectively mirror rising dread, evolving from city nooks to horizon edge without spatial drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncover expedition truth escalates accumulatively from shell crack to dread message and whistle defiance narrowing options to step into unknown; cost felt in oppressive watchers' gaze and heart pounding, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of defiant curiosity amid unknown's cost emerges organically from watchers motif shifting oppressive; final image of pressing on reweights premise without statement, though some repetition dilutes resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward shell patterns and unease; voice texture distinct in rhythmic dread buildup, though minor repetition of "felt" constructions slightly erodes under sustained pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops in journey beats ("Lyra walked... felt... watchers looming" repeated across final third) and synonym churn for dread dull closure propulsion; template cadence in sun/weight descriptions creates drumbeat rhythm obscuring final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of turtle-shell city and pattern-deciphering cartographer transforms exploration trope; risk in sunwashed dread tone heightens inevitability of defiant step without gimmickry.</comment>
