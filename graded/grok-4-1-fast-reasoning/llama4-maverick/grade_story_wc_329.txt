<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Direct telling of Luna's motivation ("Her motivation was...") undermines concrete interiority; lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene, with Luna's choices feeling declarative rather than pressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with music's progressive effects building to RR closure in statues' full awakening and Luna's departure; cost legible in "task was far from over" foreclosing easy stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Enchanted orchard and statues constrain choices by responding selectively to music, charging final glow image; sensory details (stardust flowers, sweet air) vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of awakening beauty tightens once via statues' stirring/cracking/uprooting under Accumulative lens; agency in Luna's melody choice clear, but lacks option-narrowing trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of reawakened beauty emerges from music's accumulative effects on particulars; explicit "mechanical grip loosened" slightly undercuts non-literal resonance in final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual bias toward fragile beauty stable in third-person focalization; rhythmic modulation supports magical buildup without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on music's effects ("music drifted... weaving," "music was a balm," repeated awakening descriptors) dull mid-section propulsion; figurative density overwrites without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes transformed via locust shell fragility and music-heart rhythms synthesis; non-obvious mechanical world contrast heightens stakes organically.</comment>
