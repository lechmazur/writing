<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation to map empathy onto action tugs consistently but remains abstract without embodied contradiction or micro-choices revealing flaws under pressure; no internal conflict acts simultaneously in pivotal reconstitution beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase from crystal discovery through mirror glimpses to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "weight of her task, the burden of her role" reconfiguring guardianship; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vintage store mirrors constrain reconstitution method and charge final image as sentinels of wholeness; lighthouse orchard and ice floes evolve tactilely, mirroring internal balance with sensory selectivity (frost-rimed grass, scent of old wood).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fragile balance tightens texturally via meditative deepening in mirrors, narrowing to earned resolve; agency in piecing crystal forecloses imbalance path, but stakes feel abstract without visceral external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of healing fractures via empathy emerges organically from crystal/mirror particulars, resonating in final landscape sigh without moralizing; subtext in fragments-as-soul-map reweights prior whispers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with intuitive perceptual signature (sensing patterns/tensions); lyrical voice modulates rhythmically from crisp observation to meditative awe, consistent diction/texture under low stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some paraphrase loops ("peacekeeper's" repetition, glinting synonyms) and minor overwriting in stacked facets images dull density in reconstitution beat; rhythm varies read-aloud but template cadence in reflective phrases drags propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse orchard/crystal/mirrors transforms guardian trope into lyric empathy-mapping; risk in meditative pace heightens introspective stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
