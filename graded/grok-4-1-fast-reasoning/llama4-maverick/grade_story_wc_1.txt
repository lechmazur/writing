<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Unearned epiphanies dominate, e.g., "sense of clarity emerging" summarizes without contradictory impulses acting in scene; micro-choices absent, traits like "steadily adaptive" label-only.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening via frost-ledger convergence; Charged Poise closure lands on-page in "patterns...converged, revealing a new path forward" with fragility cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frost patterns as micro-setting constrain search and charge final image, mirroring internal states selectively; sensory hierarchy (crisp air, inky shadows) reflects artistic bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Abstract stakes (purpose in pauses) signaled early lack on-page tightening or reversal under Accumulative lens; no agency forecloses path with visible cost beyond summary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Frost-scorched convergence reweights legacy theme non-literally; resonance emerges organically from particulars, avoiding moralizing, with lingering ambiguity in "pauses...source of inspiration."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (pattern-noticing) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates to dawn peace, but minor repetition erodes distinction under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("felt a sense of" x5; "patterns" churn across para) and template cadence in reflections dull propulsion; artifacts pervade final third, obscuring closure image density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Frost-ledger synthesis transforms meditative trope via glass artist legacy; fresh inflection in pattern convergence feels earned, though canyon epiphany hedges boldness.</comment>
