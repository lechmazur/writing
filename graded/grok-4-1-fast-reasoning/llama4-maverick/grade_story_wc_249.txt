<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Aria's interiority relies on abstract labels like "auroral sorrow" and unearned epiphanies rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene; drumming reveals mild rebellion but lacks embodied conflict or micro-choices under pressure. Final peace feels summarized, not earned by prior causality with visible cost on pivotal vision beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drumming builds density to vortex vision as RR/Charged Poise with cost (fleeting connection, "memories fragile") legible in lagoon dimming and lingering light. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (vibrations, glow, drumming resonance) reflects POV priorities; garden/lagoon constrain choices (drumming/perch respond) and charge final image (soft glow on horizon). No white-room; details evolve causally without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nurture dream amid fragile memories) signaled early, tightens texturally via insistent drumming to vision; agency in drumming/perch forecloses isolation with felt cost (sorrow, fade). Escalation mild, lacks deeper option-narrowing under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragile connection emerges organically from particulars (drumming response, vortex dissolution); final image (lagoon glow, beacon) offers resonant CR reweighting entanglement's cost without moralizing. No overt statements; ambiguity lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (sound/light attunement); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, distinct texture in syntax/word choice suits lyric mode. No head-hopping; elision purposeful, paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("auric lagoon" x10+, paraphrase churn on connection/sorrow) and synonym redundancy dull momentum, especially mid-build; figurative density overwrites without payoff in vision beat. Read-aloud rhythmic but dragged by scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh sci-fi lyric synthesis of sound/memory entanglement transforms tropes via specific garden mechanics; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
