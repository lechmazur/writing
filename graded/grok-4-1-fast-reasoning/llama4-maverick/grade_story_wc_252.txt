<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract epiphanies like "understood that the disappearing island was not a place, but a state of being," lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; motivation intensifies but feels told over embodied under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building via whale song and swim to CR closure ("weight of her past begin to detach"); orientation anchored early; cost legible in shedding past burdens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sea, dock, and scrimshaw constrain swim and charge final image (glow illuminates path, clutched at return); sensory details selective and purposeful, filtered through Kael's sea-pull.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom via true nature) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as song pulls her deeper with agency in swim; cost felt in detaching past, charging final poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of inner freedom emerges organically from scrimshaw, swim, and realization; final image ("returns...spirit at peace") offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting island as state of being.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (sea-obsessed noticing); lyrical voice modulates rhythm purposefully, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Repetitive "felt" stems and paraphrase loops in realization beat ("felt her heart unlock...felt a deep sense") dull peak density; strong rhythmic propulsion otherwise, no major artifacts at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh mythic synthesis of scrimshaw lore and whale transformation elevates sea-discovery trope; risk in lyrical CR pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
