<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; interiority remains serene summary without embodied conflict or micro-choices under pressure. Motivation to "forgive the unfinished" is declared but not tested via struggle. Final accomplishment feels unearned, lacking visible cost on prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and holds: density builds to Charged Poise closure in final steps back/pride, reconfiguring task with felt peace cost. Orientation anchored early in sanctuary/aurora. Thin causality—no meaningful tightening narrows options; process unfolds without reversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Recurring objects (rose thorn, key) charge final image, constraining reflective mood. Sensory details (dripping stalactites, rose scent, pearl twilight) selectively mirror internal states through action. Vivid integration avoids white-room; for 9+ gate met via object in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>No dominant stake tightening under lens; subtle treason lacks on-page reversal or deepening that forecloses options. Pressure static—serene work without opposition, cost, or agency test. Climax completion unpressured, abstract stakes unmaterialized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of subversive creation emerges organically from forging acts/images, resonating in final "new narrative" without moralizing. Returning thorn/text hue reweights particulars. Avoids binaries; ambiguity lingers in treason's ethics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (light/scent biases craft focus). Voice texture consistent, modulating rhythm for introspection. No head-hopping; compression purposeful for accumulative build. Q7 debt caps higher.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("heritage rose thorn" x5 verbatim, "forgive the unfinished" x3, "marble sanctuary" variations) create paraphrase churn across final third, dulling closure image (−1.7 artifact pack). Template cadence in descriptive runs (e.g., "seemed to" x4). Overwriting muddles with stacked metaphors every high-density beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh lyrical forgery premise transforms historical subversion via textural build. Poetic elements (aurora/petal hues) synthesize organically. Risks bold compression but repetition dilutes risk heightening.</comment>
