<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Collector motivation clear but generic; lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene, with confession beat summarized rather than dramatized through micro-choices. Spirit one-note, tooth curiosity feels unearned without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: mist/whispers build density to soul release as Charged Poise with burden cost legible in "weight of her task." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent, closure on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (mist ankles, harp distortion, damp earth) mirrors internal states purposefully; recurring mist constrains movement and charges final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide soul) tightens via louder notes and confession deepening knowledge; release forecloses unrest with felt purpose burden. Agency in humming counterpoint under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of joy in sorrow emerges organically via confession-to-hum arc; "luminous ache" bookends reweight premise without moralizing, inviting ambiguity in collector's burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (accustomed to whispers/dead); poetic diction/rhythm modulates consistently, biased noticing sharpens urgency without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("mist swirled," "footsteps quiet/damp earth") and synonym churn (peace/solace/healing) dull density across beats, with minor overwriting in poetic flourishes; closure image clear despite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh supernatural collector premise transformed via harp/tooth particulars and accumulative release; risks poetic tone without gimmick, synthesis feels organic to closure poise.</comment>
