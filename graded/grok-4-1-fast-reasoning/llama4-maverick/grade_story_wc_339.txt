<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Quietly analytic trait shown effectively in untangling the net for clarity, with embodied melancholy in red-rimmed eyes; motivation intensifies through discoveries. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—progression feels rationally tidy without mid-crisis ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (globe, logbook, net, lectures) build density to CR closure in final ascent image, where perspective shifts with felt cost of impermanence. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via net message suffices. No causality breaks touch ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sunken library vividly selective—luminescent fish, salt/decay, wading debris constrain exploration; snow globe as micro-setting charges final image reprise. Sensory hierarchy fits analytic POV; spatial choreography coherent. Environment subtly mirrors transience without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding letting go) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through artifact insights narrowing to personal reframing; agency in micro-choices like transcribing yields cost in melancholy weight. Escalation coherent under lens; visible price in "sophisticated sorrow" charges poise at end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of letting go as reframing emerges from particulars (net message, lectures, globe), with resonant CR in final snow settling. Net's explicit "To let go is not to release, but to reframe" articulates thesis directly, flattening subtext in pivotal revelation beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>First-person POV stable, perceptual signature quietly analytic in cryptic knot-noticing; rhythm modulates reflectively without head-hopping. Voice texture distinct in syntax like "fingers began to move with a life of their own." No dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm; snow globe returns build without loops. Minor paraphrase in melancholy/reprise phrasing ("weight... settle") slightly dulls propulsion, but no artifacts obscure closure image. Varied openings support read-aloud flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh underwater library synthesizing Earhart loss, physics metaphors, and analytic release transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric ascent closure feels inevitable; no derivative hedging—particulars like knot-message anchor vision.</comment>
