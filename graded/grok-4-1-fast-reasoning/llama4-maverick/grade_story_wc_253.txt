<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Abstract labels like "cultivating lightness in grief" and "moral ambiguity" replace embodied contradictions or micro-choices; no pivotal on-page action reveals values hierarchy with cost, as in bouquet placement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density build from foraging to final image; conceptual repricing in "darkness deepened... whisper of Echo's narrative" lands legible cost of transience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Wind turbines' "whirred and creaked" and farmhouse details anchor post-Mandate desolation, mirroring void; bouquet as recurring object charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bouquet deepens grief stake under accumulative lens, infusing narrations with longing; cost felt in "emotional void" persistence at ending eyes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bouquet's "once-vibrant petals now faded" motif reweights transience theme; final "glimmer of hope" in blank eyes offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited voice stable with perceptual signature in dramatic mundane imbueing; rhythmic modulation supports hush tone without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in narration descriptions ("voice would rise and fall... words wove a spell... weaving a narrative"); repetitive "remade hush" and figurative density dull reflection beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh post-Mandate void transformed via blank performer's art; turbines-farmhouse synthesis risks lyric hush payoff inevitably from particulars.</comment>
