<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>No internal conflict or contradictory impulses act in scene; passive observation yields unearned epiphany of "deep understanding" without micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with closure as Charged Poise in final image of poet walking away, reconfiguring transience (kite loss) as beauty; cost legible in feather's symbol of impermanence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (lapping water, swirling mist) mirror internal harmony and charge final lagoon reflection; recurring wet sand/feather constrain perception and image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>No dominant stake tightening or agency foreclosing path; kite snap fails as meaningful reversal, leaving static meditation without on-page cost or narrowed options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in incompleteness emerges via feather/kite but verges on overt statement in poem; resonant end reweights prior images without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature (noticing iridescence, tendrils); rhythmic lyricism modulates effectively, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("gentle lapping," repeated "beauty"/"peace"/smiles across beats) and synonym churn dull density; figurative density overwrites without payoff in meditative stretches.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Mystic poet epiphany on beach transforms trope minimally; familiar transcendental arc lacks fresh synthesis or risk.</comment>
