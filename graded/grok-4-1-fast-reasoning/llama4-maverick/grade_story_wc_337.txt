<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Limited interior contradiction or embodied emotion; abstract labels like "lucid unrest" substitute for particular micro-choices under pressure, flattening the restorer into a stock mystic figure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with silence density building to closure at "the last knot fell away," where spirits dissipate in Charged Poise reconfiguration; felt cost legible in her ensuing unrest, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prismatic walls and starlight kaleidoscope vividly constrain and charge her hands/net work; selective sensory hush and glow integrate purposefully, mirroring internal flow without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to ground spirits escalates accumulatively via stirring spirits/whispers to decisive last-knot tightening; agency in unraveling forecloses turmoil with unrest cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of craft-induced peace emerges from silence accumulation and spirit release without statement; resonant in final purposeful return, though repetition slightly mutes subtextual ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature attuned to whispers/past; poetic diction consistent but marred by minor repetitive stems in emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("interlaced hush," "accumulated silence") and synonym churn across adjacent lines dull density; template cadence in closing returns (needle glints twice) creates scaffold without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of net-restorer grounding spirits transforms trope via textured silence-build; risk in abstract mysticism pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
