<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Claustrophobia introduced but lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene, melting away without micro-choice struggle; epiphany at crystal touch feels unearned via stock phrasing rather than embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from music guide to crystal vision; clear CR closure in realization of insight as key, with wistful pang as felt cost on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tunnels and organ music constrain path and charge climax; sensory details like "damp earth" and "rusted hinges" filter through explorer bias, evolving with events to mirror freedom shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of key-hunt tightens via crystal deepening under Accumulative lens, narrowing to insight with agency in touch; cost legible in "pang of wistful rebellion."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of discovery as transformation emerges organically from fallow-to-vitality arc; final starlit image offers resonant CR answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in history/music focus; rhythmic prose modulates intensity, though some filter verbs dull crystal pulse immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Repetitive "echoing"/"reverberations" loops and purple flourishes like "spatial mutiny" create artifact drag in climax beat; overwriting obscures propulsion without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Organ-crystal guide transforms explorer trope into textural quest; fresh insight repricing feels earned in hindsight, though fantasy frame hedges boldness.</comment>
