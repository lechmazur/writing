<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to preserve heritage is consistent but lacks intensification through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; no internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene. Group remains passive backdrop without applying pressure. Final purpose feels declared rather than earned via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of revelations builds to thawing chamber as tightening, yielding Charged Poise closure in Elena's guardian realization with felt weight of responsibility. Orientation anchored early via tour in grotto. Single scene fits scope; cost legible in "weight of their discovery settling upon them."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (scent of damp earth, luminescent fungi, rushing water) filters through Elena's cultural lens, guiding tour progression. Setting evolves causally with thawing ice mirroring history's surfacing. No constraint on pivotal choices, capping high band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cultural revelation signaled early but escalates minimally via passive thawing; no agency-driven narrowing of options or trade-off under Accumulative lens. Tension atmospheric ("rosewater dread") but lacks coherent pressure forcing stance. Revelation lacks visible price altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of preservation emerges organically from particulars like bread sculptures and opera glass, reweighting city's refuge as remembrance. Final beekeeper analogy offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Some overt parallels (noblewoman to city) border statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature tied to historical appreciation; diction textured but modulates unevenly. No dialogue to judge. Prose rhythm supports accumulative build without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops dull momentum (e.g., repeated "stories...beneath the surface" and "weight" motifs across paragraphs). Redundancies in lingering gazes and emerald lens descriptions create synonym churn. Density varies but artifacts pervade final third, touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Unique synthesis of grotto revelations (thawing initial-bread, opera glass, beekeeper echo) transforms heritage trope into textured remembrance. Fresh particulars like rosewater dread add inflection. No close template echoes; risk in surreal elements heightens without gimmick.</comment>
