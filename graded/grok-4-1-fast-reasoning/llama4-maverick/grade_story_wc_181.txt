<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Curator's curiosity drives micro-choices like picking up the object and following the hum, but interiority relies on stock phrases like "mind expanding" and the bathroom epiphany feels unearned without prior contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from scents and humming to realization; closure as Conceptual Repricing lands via "understanding of the universe shift" with felt cost in brightened disquiet; continuous scene fits scope, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "sweet, intoxicating scent" and "swirling patterns on the walls" integrate with action; astral orchard and bathroom subtly mirror internal expansion, charging the final blooming image without constraining choices tightly enough for 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of curiosity vs. disquiet signaled early with textural accumulation to breakthrough, but escalation lacks agency-driven tightening or visible trade-off; surrounding by figures complicates mildly but pressure stays low, cost legible only obliquely in ending disquiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear knowledge emerges organically from realization and book; final image of "blossoms shone like stars" offers resonant non-literal reweighting, but direct statement "knowledge was not a linear progression" borders on overt without full complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with consistent surreal perceptual signature in noticing "shimmering like stardust"; rhythmic prose modulates mildly with intensity, no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive "seemed to" (four uses) and "disquiet" loops create paraphrase churn, dulling density in middle; overwriting in "very fabric of reality was being stretched" mixes metaphors without payoff, but rhythm varies enough for propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astral orchard, pistachio cameo, and bathroom epiphany transforms surreal discovery trope; risk in nonlinear forbidden knowledge frame feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
