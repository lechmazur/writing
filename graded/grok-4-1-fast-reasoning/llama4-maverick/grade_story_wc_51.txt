<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Weaver's motivation is told abstractly without contradictory impulses or embodied micro-choices under pressure; contemplative process lacks internal conflict or specific flaws revealed through action. No character-particular interiority beyond generic serenity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and holds: density builds from entry to weaving to CR closure in tapestry/legend as soul reflection, with felt cost of ephemeral vanishing into mist ("weaver vanished into the morning mist"). Single scene oriented early; one meaningful cadence shift suffices but lacks tightening constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (damp earth, gravel crunch, luminescent fungi) filters through weaver's priorities, subtly mirroring internal states without overt symbolism; grotto constrains weaving space. Charges final image without pivotal choice constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect burdens) signaled early but remains abstract/static under Accumulative lens; no on-page reversal, deepening, or agency test narrowing options—pure endurance without felt trade-off or pressure coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of burdens as hidden patterns emerges organically from weaving/tapestry; final image ("glimpses of the weaver's tapestry") offers resonant CR reweighting inner landscapes without moralizing. Complexity lingers in ambiguity of enduring chaos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in poetic noticing (e.g., "threads... shimmering with a light that was both fragile and resilient"); rhythmic texture modulates but elevated diction borders opacity in peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Heavy overwrite with stacked metaphors (e.g., "whalebone reverie" reprise), paraphrase loops ("shingled hush" echoed without progression), and template cadence in descriptive runs dull momentum; density high but artifacts obscure propulsion in closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractal weaving burdens in poetic fable transforms mystic trope via specific images (tapestry as soul landscape); risk in lyric accumulation heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
