<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Interiority relies on repetitive abstract summaries like "felt a sense of" without embodied contradiction acting in scene; "strangely honest" label acknowledges turmoil but lacks micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values under pressure. No pivotal flaw at closure, but declarative epiphanies undermine individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase as clearing deepens and wisdom resonates; Charged Poise closure in final readiness with felt cost of ongoing turmoil legible ("turmoil that still lay beneath"). Orientation anchored early; one tightening via prophet's speech suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sensory details like "scent of sandalwood and myrrh" and "kinetic parapet pulsed with soft blue light" selectively mirror inner calm, constraining consecration via dunes/parapet; pavilion and dunes evolve coherently without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve wisdom signaled early, deepens accumulatively as clearing forms and absorbs words; agency in weaving via peripheral awareness forecloses turmoil with minimal cost legibility at "surveyed the clearing," charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of nurturing wisdom amid inner turmoil emerges organically from particulars like prophet's whispers and parapet's hum; final image of tending clearing offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in mystical noticing ("peripheral awareness"); rhythmic modulation supports whisperfield tone, but minor repetition dulls under low pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn on "sense of calm/peace" (e.g., repeated "felt a sense of" across paragraphs) create template cadence, dulling propulsion; artifacts pervade final third, obscuring closure image density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes transformed via line walker's peripheral weaving, but meditative stasis feels familiar without bold risk; fresh details like half-mask glint personalize mildly.</comment>
