<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak dominates pivotal realizations ("blessing and curse," "fractured grace") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; truthful trait told without complicating on-page actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via discovery density leading to CR closure (resolve amid storm with glass eye cost felt in psyche mirror); orientation clear early, but no meaningful tightening or pattern break narrows options decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Battered orchard ravine vividly anchors and pressures navigation/search ("treacherous terrain," "twisted trees"), mirroring psyche and charging final storm image; sensory selection purposeful and POV-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (temper truthfulness for safety) signaled but remains abstract with no agency-driven reversal or visible cost altering tactics; discoveries deepen obliquely without coherent pressure under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of rational-emotional balance post-virus emerges organically from relic history and orchard mirror; final image offers resonant CR without moralizing, though some direct statements dilute subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with reflective perceptual signature suits rational forager; rhythmic prose modulates tone effectively, though minor syntactic repetition dulls peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in realization beats ("realized," "felt") and template cadence ("As they," "the forager's") create redundancy; overwriting with repeated motifs dulls density in reflective stretches.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empathy virus, truffle foraging, and relic transforms tropes into organic world; glass eye reprise feels inevitable, heightening fractured psyche stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
