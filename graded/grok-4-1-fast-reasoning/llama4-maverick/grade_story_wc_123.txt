<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak dominates ("credibly curious nature," "meticulous nature," "nurture integrity in solitude"), replacing embodied emotion and micro-choices with abstract summaries; no contradictory impulses act in scene to earn final resolve. Interiority relies on stock phrasing like "heart quickened" and "shiver run down her spine" without particularity. Final determination feels unearned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from message discovery to realization, landing Charged Poise closure in final lines ("She walked away... stars shining brightly") where resolve reconfigures caution with felt cost of isolation. Orientation anchored early (courtyard, dusk, storm recorder). Weak linkage: inciting pigeon lacks causal pressure test, leading to static reflection without tightening options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (rustle of leaves, scent of flowers, crickets, stars) mirrors internal solace effectively. Courtyard fountain enables pigeon/message interaction, subtly guiding choice. Repetition of shadows and tranquility slightly dilutes; no constraint on pivotal intuition beat pulls from 8+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose lab truth cautiously) signaled via message, but no on-page reversal or agency-driven deepening under Accumulative lens; "shiver" and "watched" feeling add texture but remain abstract without foreclosing options. Cost legible in caution but not viscerally tested. Stakes declared more than dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of solitary integrity amid lurking danger emerges organically from particulars like clutched tube and stars, offering resonant non-literal close via reconfigured tranquility. Subtext in shadows/trees tensioning peace works quietly. Direct phrases ("layered tranquility") verge on assertion, muting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with consistent perceptual signature (nature-attuned, contemplative noticing). Prose texture modulates from descriptive to resolute cadence at end. Minor repetition in syntax ("she... seemed," "she felt") erodes distinction under reflection peaks; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound (multiple "pondered," "thoughts," "contemplative silence/lost in thought/sit in quiet" restatements without pressure advance); synonym churn on tranquility/shadows triggers −1.0. Template cadence in sequential "As... she" sentences dulls propulsion. Closure image intact but artifacts pervade final third, disallowing high bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm recorder occupation with pigeon-quarantine mystery, transformed via tranquil tone on sinister hint. No bold risks; generic realization arc ("newfound sense of purpose") lacks hindsight inevitability. Premise echoes standard discovery tropes without deep subversion.</comment>
