<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Solid motivation to preserve hope rooted in stone and footage study, with embodied warmth in stone signaling resolve; minor slip in unearned epiphany of shadow's nature without deeper contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density in footage builds to CR closure via realization of shadow as fears, reweighting premise with felt cost of task's weight; "she rose...began to make her way" crystallizes decisive share with luminous regret.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory anchors (parchment scent, orbs' glow) filter through POV's sharp notice, mirroring internal peace; library's cloud-soft floor and brightening orbs charge final image, constraining reflective deepening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of hope preservation tightens accumulatively via shadow noticing to resilience pattern; agency in footage comparison forces stance crystallization with visible cost in "undauted" determination against encroaching weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of hope vs unbound shadow emerges organically from footage patterns and stone reprise, culminating in non-literal CR where library glow reweights collective fears without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in "sharp eyes scanning"; rhythmic poetic texture modulates effectively, though minor convergence in repetitive phrasing like "luminous regret."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("luminous regret" x2, "softly deliberate" x2, shadow "seep"/"tendrils") and paraphrase churn in reflective blocks dull density; overwriting in "ethereal gardens...sea of clouds" obscures propulsion in peak realization beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shareable dreams, dusk noticer, unbound shadow transforms collective unconscious trope; risk in poetic Accumulative drive feels organic and inevitable in hindsight via stone-library resonance.</comment>
