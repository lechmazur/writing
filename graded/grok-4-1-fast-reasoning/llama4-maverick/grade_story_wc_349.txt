<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels like "profound realization" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; motivation intensifies serenely but lacks internal conflict acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through density buildup to CR closure in final belonging image with felt cost of prior disconnection; orientation anchored early, one scene fits scope, but minimal tightening limits propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Glass orchard and swirling clouds vividly filter through Ember's attunement, subtly guiding choices like bottle handling and charging realizations; sensory selectivity mirrors internal harmony without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering secrets signaled early but escalates minimally under accumulative lens; hesitation forecloses incision as one tightening, but low opposition and abstract cost weaken pressure coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of stories woven into place's essence emerges from particulars like bottle and patterns, resonating in final attunement without moralizing; subtext in hesitation enriches complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with ethereal perceptual signature attuned to library's "ethereal music"; voice rhythm modulates purposefully from curiosity to harmony, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in repeated "felt" realizations and swirling clouds dull closure density; some overwriting with stacked abstractions like "overwhelming desire" creates minor scaffold, but rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass orchard library and bottled moonlight transforms wonder tropes organically; risk in mystical "glimmering parole" heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
