<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Direct trait labels like "I was a grim optimist" and "balancedly daring" dominate over embodied impulses in dice-roll beats, flattening internal contradiction during endurance closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density buildup in air/stairs/self-fragmentation; CR closure lands in "forever bound... content to be bound" with legible conceptual cost of freedom foreclosed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Infinite staircase and chipped die as micro-settings constrain endless ascent and charge final "clutched tightly" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Obsession stake signaled early tightens via fragmenting self under accumulative lens, forcing endurance agency with binding cost crystallized on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Final "perpetual motion of my own curiosity" image resonantly reweights journey-over-destination premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual-proabilistic signature and introspective rhythm control sustained; minor repetition nears experimental tolerance but lacks early pattern-teach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Pervasive template cadence ("As I climbed... seemed to") and paraphrase loops ("endless/never-ending/infinite"; "dice seemed") across beats dull propulsion, touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Surreal dice-perpetual motion fusion on infinite staircase transforms Sisyphus trope through obsession's specificity.</comment>
