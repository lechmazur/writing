<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear and intensifies from boredom to awe via amulet curiosity, with embodied emotion in "heart, long thought to be still, stirred." Internal conflict limited to thoughts rather than simultaneous impulses acting in scene. Change feels earned by prior causality at duplicate meeting, but lacks deeper flaws complicating peak choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: energy density builds to pattern break with duplicate emergence and CR closure ("goodbye was not an end, but a transformation"). Orientation anchored early in escondite during storm. Cost legible in "boredom replaced by awe" and faded presence, reconfiguring options without slips touching ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite and swirling colors constrain action by amplifying fields and charge final image, evolving causally with energy surge. Sensory hierarchy vivid and selective (vibrating air, deepening colors mirroring internal shift). No white-room; spatial coherence in distortion pocket.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover after goodbye) signaled early, escalates via density increase in fields/energy to cadence shift at duplicate ("I am what remains after goodbye"), narrowing to transformation under Accumulative lens. Agency in weaving fields forces trade-off with reality bend. Cost felt in embracing infinite over boredom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of goodbye as transformation emerges organically from duplicate encounter and final step, reweighting premise via CR without statement. Resonance from particulars like hand meeting and pulsing amulet. Invites reflection on multiverse possibilities with ambiguity lingering in "dimensional echo."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in dimensional awareness (tingling senses, swirling paths). Poetic diction and rhythm modulate with intensity, consistent under stress. Brief duplicate dialogue natural, subtext-heavy, advances revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Repetitive "colors swirled/danced" and paraphrase loops (e.g., energy/storm descriptions in opening/middle/end) create template cadence, dulling propulsion (-0.6). Rhythm varies but overwrites high-pressure surge with stacked modifiers. Density high otherwise, closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of immortal boredom, spatial mutiny, and duplicate as "after goodbye" transforms tropes organically. Risk in prismatic lyricism heightens awe without gimmick. Final reconfiguration inevitable from established energy build.</comment>
