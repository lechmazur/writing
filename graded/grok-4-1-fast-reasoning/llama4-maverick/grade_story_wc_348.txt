<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Polymer chemist's professional lens particularizes foam observation effectively; grief motivation rooted consistently but lacks dramatized contradictory impulses acting in scene, especially at insight pivot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from grief density to insight cadence shift; Charged Poise closure legible in "heart felt lighter... ready to face" with past separation as felt cost; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ravine foam patterns and chrysalis constrain insight choice and charge final image as transformation marker; sensory hierarchy (sound primacy) reflects symphonic POV bias purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Internal grief-to-purpose stake signaled early with foam insight as sole deepening under accumulative lens; no foreclosed option or trade-off charges pressure, keeping stakes abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of separation-to-connection emerges organically from foam networks and chrysalis reprise; explicit "perfect metaphor" line tensions subtext without full collapse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable with perceptual signature in symphonic ear-noticing; rhythmic calm fits vignette but minor distance consistency in reflective blocks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on grief states ("lingered... loosen... lift... replaced") and "As [she]" template cadence across openings dull propulsion; artifacts pervade without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Polymer-foam synthesis offers fresh inflection on transformation trope; overall grief-via-nature epiphany arc too familiar without bold risk.</comment>
