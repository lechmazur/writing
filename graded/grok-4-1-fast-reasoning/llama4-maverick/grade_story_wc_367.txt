<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Consistent motivation rooted in tradition but lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; interiority declarative ("believed her actions were Accidentally prophetic") without embodied pressure or micro-choice hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds ritual density to charged poise closure in dawn's rise and perpetual cycle; cost of ongoing duty legible in "her work was just beginning" descent image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lighthouse stairs and lantern constrain ritual ascent/adjustments; starry shadows and beam integrate purposefully, charging final sentinel image without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to steer dawn signaled early but escalation mild via ritual steps without reversal narrowing options; no live trade-off or felt risk in accumulative density to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of enduring traditions vs. digital ephemerality emerges organically from ritual particulars; final legend growth reconfigures premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with light-shadow perceptual bias; rhythmic diction modulates ritual intensity, though minor repetition borders on uniformity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("shaped the dawn," "new reality coalescing") and template cadence ("The [noun], [description]") across descriptions create redundancy; synonym churn on light/shadows dulls propulsion in peak ritual beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of optics ritual ("total internal reflection") and mythic herald in post-newspaper world; premise implications followed boldly to cyclic closure.</comment>
