<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Claustrophobic spelunker trait contradicts appealingly early but remains label-driven without embodied micro-choices under pressure; motivation to "stand by the unremembered" arrives late via summary, flattening internal conflict. No simultaneous contradictory impulses act in pivotal logbook or escape beats. Final change feels told rather than earned through scene causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Oriented clearly by ~50 words; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density buildup to "deafening roar" reconfiguration at emergence (Charged Poise CR with felt transformation cost). Single continuous scene fits defaults; one tightening via tide shift narrows options. Lacks causal opposition, making plot summary-like before closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: "steel walls covered in anemones and coral," "faint hum of the cables... reverberate through every cell" mirrors internal shift and constrains escape timing. Facility micro-setting guides choices via cramped corridors and pressure shifts. Recurring cables charge final "crashing hush" image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (codex retrieval/escape) signaled early, one tightening via "tidal currents... changing" forces haste, but under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres texturally without narrowing options via agency. Tide window cost felt but resolved without trade-off or reversal. Low opposition yields abstract tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of honoring unremembered via invisible connections emerges organically from logbook realization and cable travel, reweighted in final "connection... stronger than ever" without moralizing. Closing image offers non-literal answer to beneath-surface mysteries. Minor told epiphany ("sense of peace wash over her") dilutes resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single third-person limited POV with perceptual bias toward tight spaces and hums; voice texture modulates via rhythmic sensory buildup. No dialogue. Clean free indirect in "mind racing with the implications," though occasional filter verbs soften immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Solid propulsion with varied rhythm, but paraphrase loops in ending ("sense of peace... changed... never forget") and repetitive "crashing hush" create minor redundancy. High info density integrates setting/action; no heavy artifacts touch closure. Cliché phrasing ("gasping with the sudden change") dulls peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spelunking, phase-travel cables, and codex illuminant transforms undersea tropes via facility's lived decay and sensory hush buildup. Cable emergence turn feels inevitable from logbook setup. Bold risk in quiet CR closure heightens conceptual stakes.</comment>
