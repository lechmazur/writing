<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Coachman's interiority concrete in meditative sewing and pondering but lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; final satisfaction feels unearned without prior micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values under pressure. Woman underdeveloped as pale archetype with no pressure interaction. Patience as endurance credible but passive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from fog/mist to clearing and arrival as Charged Poise RR; orientation anchored early (coachman on ferry); one tightening via figure emerging narrows wait to revelation with felt cost of eroded patience. Closure cost legible in "patience worn smooth" echoing to serenity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (lapping water, damp earth, needle glint) filters through coachman's attuned perception, mirroring internal simmer; fog constrains visibility/waiting, charges final clearing image. Evolving details (mist clears, gutters stop) causal with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of waiting for traveler signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ambient cues to figure's emergence; one deepening (stillness post-gutters) reweights patience cost visibly. Low agency but endurance forecloses uncertainty with relational serenity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Palimpsest promise/distillation theme emerges organically from sewing/pondering to shared understanding; final image reconfigures complexity-to-essence without moralizing, resonant via fog reveal. Ambiguity in traveler lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in ambient attunement; rhythmic modulation meditative to serene. Lyrical diction purposeful for texture; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting with figurative density (palimpsest/geological, umbilical thread) in most sentences lacking pattern payoff; paraphrase loops (mist/fog/shroud, slow/deliberate/gentle) and synonym churn (serenity variations) dull propulsion. Template cadence in "felt a sense of" repeats obscures closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ferry revelation transforms foggy crossing trope via needle meditation but relies on gothic serenity archetype without bold risk; yarn needle adds quirky synthesis grounded in coachman but not transformative.</comment>
