<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority concrete but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; wistfully pragmatic trait motivates pruning mildly without higher-stakes micro-choices under pressure, yielding observational rather than pivotal character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as images layer to charged poise closure; rosebush pruning delivers resonant reconfiguration with cycle-end cost legible in final refreshed stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fire escape and harbor moonlight constrain ritualistic pruning; rosebush recurs to charge closure image of resilience, with sensory details (oars rhythm, hush) purposefully filtered through reverent POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of instilling light tightens accumulatively via hush-to-calm cadence and petal-drop pressure, narrowing to endurance with pruning cost; lacks agency-driven reversal to fully foreclose options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Protected vulnerability theme emerges organically from rosebush cycle, tooth depths, and light motif shifting to resilience without statement; final image reweights urban nurturing non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature biased to rhythms/light; voice modulates intensity coherently, though minor register elevation in reflections borders opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Repetitive "sense of" phrasing and paraphrase loops (peace/tranquility/calm restatements across paragraphs) create churn, dulling propulsion; template cadence in descriptive runs pervades without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lockmaster tooth transforms gardener trope with hidden-past inflection, synthesizing urban poetry originally; lyric risk heightens resonance without obscuring closure.</comment>
