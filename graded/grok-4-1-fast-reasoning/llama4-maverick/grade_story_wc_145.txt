<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Emilia's dry wit absent despite prompt; interiority generic with stock turmoil and excitement lacking embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Pivotal deciphering moment shows no internal conflict, just excitement. Solo POV yields no relational crucible, rendering traits label-only.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with atmospheric buildup to Charged Poise closure (stepping on creaking ice signals cost/risk). Orientation anchored early; single scene fits scope. Weak causality: no tightening reversal, just and-then progression from search to lake with declared stakes untested.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Frozen lake and outpost vividly integrated, with ice creaking constraining final step and charging closure image. Sensory details (snow crunch, wood smoke) selective via atlas-editor's pattern-noticing bias. Minor generic winter tropes, but purposeful without stalling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find convergence) signaled early but no agency-driven tightening; deciphering lacks opposition or trade-off. Minimal escalation under accumulative lens; creaking ice hints cost but pressure static, ending in undaunted resolve without foreclosed path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of timeless quest emerges organically via phrasebook bond and pattern decode, resonating in final lake step without moralizing. Repetitive urgency undercuts subtext depth; no ironic gaps or ambiguity lingers beyond mild wonder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern-tracing; voice literary but repetitive syntax dulls under stress. No dialogue; free indirect clean but lacks rhythmic modulation at climax (deciphering).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("sense of urgency/excitement/anticipation," "silence palpable/crunch," "worrying tranquility" x3) and template cadence ("As she [explored/walked], [emotion]"). Snow crunch motif repeats redundantly without payoff; artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Condensation pattern as convergence cipher offers fresh inflection on quest trope, earned via editor's skills. Overall transforms explorer archetype mildly through mystic anomaly, but repetitive beats feel template-derived.</comment>
