<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Steadily curious trait labeled repeatedly without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; internal awe abstract, lacking flaws complicating discovery; transcendence at "Zephyr's odyssey came full circle" feels summarily unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via discoveries to CR closure ("resonated through the workshop"); orientation anchored early in workshop/sea; loose and-then sequencing softens linkages, but pattern pays off without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration of churning acid sea, pulsing gears, and glinting arrow tip mirrors decay-to-harmony arc; final image tempers corrosiveness, charging reconfiguration without constraining pivotal choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ring unheard bell) signaled early with one accumulative deepening (hidden pattern unlocked); pressure abstract, lacking trade-off or legible cost in transliteration; agency observational over decisive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Curiosity's power emerges organically via arrow tip reprise and kaleidoscope symmetries; final harmony offers resonant answer to yearning without statement, reweighting decay's menace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable with mechanical perceptual bias (whirred, pulsed); rhythmic texture suits accumulative mode; no dialogue, minor repetition erodes distinction under extended description.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("acid sea churned," "evolution," "irreverent awe" repeated across sentences); template cadence in descriptive runs dulls propulsion; low density with redundant restatements obscures momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical glider decoding algorithm in acid-sea workshop transforms steampunk tropes; kaleidoscope transliteration and unheard bell pursuit feel inevitable and risk-heightening.</comment>
