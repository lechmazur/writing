<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Eli's motivation as normality noticer drives observation but lacks embodied contradictory impulses during ritual; realizations like "forever changed" feel unearned and abstract without micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with CR closure in final realization reweighting house perception with humbling cost; orientation anchored early, but and-then sequencing from shop to ritual softens tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory selectivity like "sweet scent of blooming flowers" and "lapping of waves" filters through Eli's noticing bias; orris shard as recurring micro-setting constrains ritual and charges final perceptual shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to understand alive houses signaled early but escalates abstractly via ritual without reversal narrowing options or visible trade-off; density increases mildly under accumulative lens, lacking agency-driven cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of spaces' latent aliveness emerges implicitly through ritual images without moralizing; final "living, breathing entity" offers resonant CR reweighting prior pondering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in subtle shifts like "vibrated with an expectant hush"; lyrical diction modulates rhythmically for accumulative texture without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in "sense of" repetitions (e.g., "sense of reverence," "sense of gratitude") dull density; overwrought "streetlights flickered to life, daydreaming" strains but rhythm varies overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of perfumery shard ritualizing house aliveness transforms perception tropes; "shard of hush" premise risks quiet mysticism coherently toward CR without gimmickry.</comment>
