<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Consistent curiosity drives observation, but interiority relies on labels like "diligently curious nature kicked in" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; no visible cost in final readiness moment weakens earning of change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from luminance to decoded map; charged poise closure legible in "ready to set course for the unknown" with isolation cost felt, though convenient discoveries lack tightening opposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hopscotch board constrains decoding choice centrally; starlings and cabin details filter through Eli's map-attuned perception, evolving with glow and murmurs to charge final image without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant discovery stake deepens accumulatively through noting to charting, but lacks agency-driven reversal or visible trade-off; isolation cost felt subtly in crew return but doesn't narrow options sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sociable isolation theme emerges organically from solo work amid crew return, reweighted in final "grateful to be a part of it" without statement; luminance shift mirrors connection-through-discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with map-biased perception; rhythmic repetition of "scratch of pen" and "starlings" taught early supports accumulative texture, though minor uniformity in sentence cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in work beats ("pored over their charts... bent back to their work"; "scratch of their pen" twice) dull propulsion; repetitive Eli-stems and starlings mentions create template cadence without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Hopscotch-code for star-map transforms relic into discovery tool organically; luminance-phrasebook synthesis fresh, committing to fantasy logic without hedging.</comment>
