<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Artist's curiosity and reverence compel discovery of safe and coin, aligning actions with motivation to mirror the infinite, but lacks embodied contradictory impulses under pressure, relying on steady competence without visible flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as painting, safe discovery, and coin pattern build density to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "a fleeting instant of beauty that would soon be lost forever" as artist departs with secrets amid demolition rumble.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "scent of aged parchment" and dappled light filter through branches constrain the urgent craft before demolition, charging the final indigo sky mirror in the portrait and walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture essence tightens accumulatively via coin's limit-revealing pattern deepening brushstrokes; agency in persisting and securing secrets forecloses library's loss with felt transience cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of finite capturing infinite emerges organically from coin message and portrait glow, offering resonant non-literal answer in final image of carried essence versus demolished transience without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with fractal-perceptual signature in noticing "subtle topography"; lyrical rhythm modulates to charged hush, no elision or head-hopping obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dense, propulsive prose with varied rhythm supports accumulative build, but mild loops in "stillness"/"hush" phrasing slightly dull late momentum without touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blind fractal artist, coin topography message, and tree-library demolition transforms impermanence tropes; risk in poetic conceit heightens stakes inevitably toward carried-t essence close.</comment>
