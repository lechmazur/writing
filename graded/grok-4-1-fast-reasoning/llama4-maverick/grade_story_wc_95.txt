<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mechanical arm's precision in the duel climax effectively embodies skill under pressure; motivation to turn questions into destinations drives interiority but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, yielding competent but unlayered traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from waiting to duel climax then CR closure in realization that victory is the journey; lingering questions provide legible conceptual cost in final image, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sundial's coded angles constrain arguments and charge duel tactics; sensory integration like sword whoosh and metal scent evolves with action, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
