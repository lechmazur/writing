<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Motivation inconsistent—shifts abruptly from watch fob for family secrets to thwarting Shadow without causal anchor; interiority stock ("heart quickened") lacks contradiction or embodiment, especially in climax standoff where no micro-choices reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Oriented early in pirate market; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via rising atmospheric density to Charged Poise closure (fragile understanding at sunrise) with oblique cost (mystery endures), but loose linkages (fob buy to confrontation) prevent tightening, no persistent constraint on tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selection ("saltwater and desperation," clinking, pier slats filtering sunrise) reflects Lena's urgency and anchors spatial choreography; subtly pressures navigation through stalls and lurking, charging final light shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thwart Shadow) signaled via whispers building tension under Accumulative lens; one deepening (eyes meet, fob glimpse sparks recognition) narrows to whisper confrontation, but agency passive—standoff dissipates via time/sunrise without protagonist-driven cost or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Fragile trust/peace emerges organically from standoff to understanding, but "capture the sound of trust breaking" feels stated thesis; tidy resolution lacks ambiguity, final pride image non-resonant without reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with clean focalization on Lena's biased perceptions (furtive glances); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("I know what you're trying to do"), but prose rhythm generic, no distinct perceptual signature under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("heart quickened" x2, tension/anticipation redundancy) and synonym churn (hush/peace, unease) dull density in high-pressure standoff; template cadence in descriptions ("air was heavy/thick") drags momentum, obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pirate market/moonshine fusion offers fresh underworld angle, transformed via atmospheric whispers to fragile truce; but hooded Shadow trope unearned, "sound of trust breaking" gimmicky without hindsight inevitability.</comment>
