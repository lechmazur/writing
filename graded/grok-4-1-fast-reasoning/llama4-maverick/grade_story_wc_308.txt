<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent (learn navigation via stillness), but lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; interiority poetic yet abstract without embodied micro-choices under pressure. Change in understanding feels earned via endurance, but no character-particular flaws or blind spots complicate path. Anthropomorphic traits suit but verge on one-note competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: perceptual density builds from arrowhead gaze to birds' patterns to universal secrets, yielding Conceptual Repricing closure where final image reconfigures reality ("navigate the labyrinthine canyons of the past"). Cost legible in centuries-long stillness felt on-page. Single contemplative scene fits scope; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid multisensory integration (vibrations, wing rushes, shadows) filters through skimmer's harmonic bias; dust accumulation and canyon echoes evolve causally, mirroring internal attunement. Recurring arrowhead charges closure image. Purposeful selectivity avoids catalog; towers/bone constrain timeless essence without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appraise arrowhead to master navigation) signaled early; textural deepening via birds narrows from relic to cosmic key, forcing endurance with felt cost of isolation in dust/time. Agency in sustained attention forecloses physical movement; pressure coheres accumulatively to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of stillness-as-movement emerges organically from perceptual buildup and arrowhead's repricing; final image ("new kind of movement... free to roam") resonates non-literally without moralizing. Complexity in harmony vs. chaos lingers via canyon echoes; earned from particulars, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (vibrational patterns, unhurried intensity); lyrical voice modulates subtly from observation to deepened resonance. Rhythmic prose suits lyric mode, taught early; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("dust continued to fall," "skimmer remained steadfast") and repetitive stems ("The skimmer's," "As the") create template cadence across multiple paragraphs, dulling propulsion; synonym churn for resolve/stillness adds redundancy. Figurative density overwrites without payoff in peak perceptual beats. Clarity holds but momentum drags.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh anthropomorphic stone perspective transforms lyric nature trope via harmonic vibrations and bird-pattern epistemology; arrowhead's evolution to "key to unlocking secrets" feels inevitable. Bold stillness premise risks stasis but heightens thematic ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
