<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority relies on labels like "serene anger simmered" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices revealing flaws; final connection feels epiphanic rather than earned through struggle. No deep internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern buildup (ink traces to aura) tightening to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "time seemed to slow...sea of uncertainty" reconfiguring Kael's quest. Orientation anchored early; one meaningful deepening at ridge crest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rocky outcroppings and wind constrain tracking choices; recurring landscape blends with ink patterns, charging final image. Sensory selection purposeful but slightly generic "fading light" without full POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (track disappearance, probe time mystery) signaled early, escalates texturally via ink density to connection; agency in following remnants narrows options with serene anger cost. No reversal but sufficient deepening under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral patterns governing time emerges organically from ink trail to shared "glimpse into the mystery"; final "map etched in disappearing ink" resonates non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing; voice texture poetic and consistent, modulating to charged rhythm at "time seemed to slow." No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "faint" (smudge, hint, remnants, aura) and "patterns" create redundancy dulling propulsion; overwriting in "wove a tale of patterns and time, of mystery and revelation" adds artifacts in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tracker quest with ink-time physics and drone yields inevitable connection; transforms tropes via specific "disappearing ink" mechanics without gimmickry.</comment>
