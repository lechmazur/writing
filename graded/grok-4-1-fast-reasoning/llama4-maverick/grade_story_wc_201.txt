<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to confront trauma is clear and intensifies, but interior conflict is summarized ("memories came flooding back") rather than shown through simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene; epiphany in clearing feels unearned without prior micro-choices revealing value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from clinic release to forest deepening; on-page CR closure ("ultraviolet penance lifting") lands with legible cost (tears); orientation anchored early, one tightening via brighter pulsing light narrowing to realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest pulses purposefully, constraining choices (calls her, responds by brightening) and charging final clearing image; proprioceptively enhanced body as micro-setting limits mobility ("stiff from prolonged immobility"); sensory hierarchy POV-specific without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confront trauma for mercy) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via memory density and forest response forcing endurance to clearing; agency in entering despite stiffness, cost felt in tears, but no live option foreclosure beyond realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through reckoning emerges organically from trauma confrontation and forest journey, resonant CR in "grasped the truth" reweighting prior memories without moralizing; subtext in displaced rooted-ness lingers via final peace amid pulsing forest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in enhanced senses; dialogue natural, goal-driven (Arin intervenes, extracts promise); some register drift to abstract phrasing ("mathematics of mercy") jars slight POV lexicon under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetitive "memories" phrasing and paraphrase loops ("trauma responses guiding... painful, but... confront them") create synonym churn across reflection beats, dulling density; some overwriting in forest descriptions without payoff, but rhythm varies overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of proprioceptive enhancement, UV penance forest, and math of mercy transforms trauma/redemption trope via specific sensory world logic; risk in abstract quest pays off in charged CR without late rules.</comment>
