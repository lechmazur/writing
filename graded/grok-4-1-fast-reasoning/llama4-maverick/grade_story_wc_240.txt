<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Motivation told abstractly ("physics of letting go," "revolutionize") without micro-choices under pressure or embodied contradiction; interiority lapses into diagnostic epiphanies like "new paradigm for connection." No earned change—final realization feels unmotivated without prior causal buildup. Single-POV lacks genuine flaws complicating observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via observational density; single scene oriented by para 1 (Lena, farm, pre-dawn). Closure as Conceptual Repricing ("boundaries... beginning to blur") with mild conceptual cost (separate self foreclosed), but cost faintly legible—no exact sentence ties undeniable price. Minimal tightening; wandering lacks linkage narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (damp earth scent, blue-green glow) reflects spatial POV bias, mirroring internal calm. Mushrooms as micro-setting charge realization subtly. Lacks constraint on choice (e.g., no navigation peril despite "labyrinthine tunnels"); strong but not pivotal for 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>No dominant stake escalation under Accumulative lens—density builds excitement but no cadence shift foreclosing options or visible cost; observation static, no reversal/deepening. "Breakthrough" declared without pressure test. Stakes abstract, unvisceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Interconnectedness theme emerges accumulatively from mushrooms/strangers but veers platitude ("complex, interconnected web"); final image offers non-literal resonance yet undercut by direct statement ("ready to revolutionize"). Lacks charged ambiguity; pseudo-profundity in "physics of letting go."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature (spatial patterns, light/shadow); rhythmic modulation builds to quiet intensity. Prose texture distinct but minor register elevation ("ethereal light," "palpable energy") jars casual observer. No dialogue; elision purposeful in reflections.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("sense of stillness," "sense of excitement"; "new understanding" x3) and template cadence ("As [time], Lena [felt]") dull density across middle; synonym churn in realizations ("understand," "grasp," "comprehend"). Rhythm varies but overwriting muddles peak ("quiet wildfire" strained). Closure image legible despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Bioluminescent farm + abstract physics fresh synthesis, but prompt-echo in "familiar strangers"/revolution feels template-derived without bold transformation. Final reconfiguration ("weaving into the fabric") inevitable yet hedges via vague optimism. Risks middle-ground abstraction over specificity.</comment>
