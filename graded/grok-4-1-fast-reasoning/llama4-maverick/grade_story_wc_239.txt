<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear but abstract and told via summary; lacks interior contradiction or embodied emotion acting in scene, with no micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure via restored balance (final dictionary close), but thin causality—journey unfolds without tightening turn narrowing options; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (aged parchment scent, resounding hush) integrate purposefully, mirroring internal attunement; dictionary as micro-setting charges final image without constraining choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel illusions) signaled early but remains abstract/viscerally unfelt; no agency-driven deepening or visible cost under lens—hiccup resolves without trade-off foreclosing path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of inward/outward unity emerges from images, but platitude-heavy ("power of the human spirit") abstracts resonance; final image offers non-literal answer yet lacks reweighting prior material with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (mystical noticing of cosmic whispers); rhythmic prose modulates effectively, no head-hopping or withholdings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Repetitive synonym loops ("hush," "silence," "stillness" cluster without pattern payoff) and paraphrase redundancy (unifying fragments echoed 4x) dull propulsion; overwriting in peak (journey descriptions) triggers −1.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mystical journey trope untransformed by specifics; cosmic witness premise feels generic spiritual vignette without fresh inflection or bold risk heightening stakes.</comment>
