<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Narrator's obsession drives pursuit but internal conflict is summarized ("wryly earnest sense of purpose") rather than shown in simultaneous impulses during exchange; micro-choices like bartering art reveal values with unease as cost, but epiphanies feel unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: brooch discovery accumulates via rain trails and markings to stranger's revelations, tightening knowledge toward CR closure in artwork where brooch glows with "otherworldly light," costing obsession and self-barter; orientation anchored early in tidal island ruins.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ruins, rain trails, and sand constrain discoveries (brooch half-buried, markings etched in walls), charging final image of island "alive with meaning"; sensory selection POV-biased toward painterly inspiration, though some generic crumbling builds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncover brooch's tie to convergence signaled early, deepens via exchange narrowing options with "unease" cost of bartering "a piece of myself"; agency in tracking forces stance crystallization in art renunciation of prior solace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of thrashing meaning from trauma emerges organically via brooch as "symbol of balance," reweighted in final art titled "Convergence" without moralizing; resonant CR answers quest through charged image of glowing brooch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>First-person POV stable with painterly perceptual signature ("intricate patterns seeming to dance"); brief dialogue natural and goal-driven during negotiation; rhythm modulates but minor register repetition ("sense of...").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("sense of... unease/awe/closure/purpose") and repeated phrasing ("haggard awe," "threshed meaning") create template cadence in reflective blocks, dulling density without obscuring closure; strong propulsion elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mystic artifact in post-apoc ruins transformed via painter's accumulative art process, but core premise echoes familiar relic quests without bold subversion; fresh in rain-trail method tying to water wars.</comment>
