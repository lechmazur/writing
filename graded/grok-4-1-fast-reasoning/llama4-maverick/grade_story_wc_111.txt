<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation to prove gardens know gardeners is consistent but lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; interiority summarizes devotion via labels like "wisely pragmatic" rather than particular impulses acting simultaneously. No on-page higher-stakes test compels endurance with felt cost. Closing pride survey feels unearned amid abstract traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of garden growth and ritual builds to Charged Poise RR at sunset vanishing, reconfiguring dresser from decay to guardian with bittersweet cycle cost legible in final image. One tightening via seasonal flourishing to night cadence. Orientation anchors early in maze heart.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Garden maze setting selectively sensory (scents of blooms/withering, towering hedges, shadows) filters through dresser's reverent bias, subtly guiding pruning/polishing paths; recurring marbles constrain ritual and charge final beacon image. Micro-setting (hands on vines/marbles) mirrors internal renewal without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nurture to prove reciprocal knowing, optimize measurable luck) signaled early; textural deepening via flourishing/ritual density narrows to endurance of cycle, with visible cost in "withered" origins to guardian reconfiguration. No reversal but cadence shift forces stance crystallization. Pressure coherent yet low-agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of nurturing's silent dialogue emerges organically from tending/marbles/growth images, resisting tidy morals via melancholic cycle ambiguity; final vanishing image resonantly reweights premise without statement. Marble polish reprise shifts from loss to reclaimed life.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with reverent perceptual signature (flora as responsive, nostalgic glow); rhythmic modulation builds poetic texture suited to textural lens, though occasional elevated diction drifts from gnarled hands' lexicon. No head-hopping; compression purposeful in rituals.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("testament" x5, "beauty"/"flourish" synonym churn across paragraphs) and template cadence ("The [noun], [adjective], [action]") dull propulsion, obscuring closure image; overwriting figurative density in peak descriptive beats violates coherence without payoff. Read-aloud rhythm drags from redundancy; scaffold like repeated "as the" stems.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of measurable luck/garden reciprocity transforms nurturing trope via marbles' chipped nostalgia and mended deception hint; risk in lyric devotion payoff feels organic, though familiar cycle-of-life echoes limit boldness. Final maze-as-narrative inflects hindsight inevitably.</comment>
