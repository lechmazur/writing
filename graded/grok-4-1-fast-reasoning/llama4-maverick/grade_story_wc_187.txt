<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Abstract interiority relies on labels like "preemptively nostalgic" without contradictory impulses acting in scene; final identity shift lacks micro-choices under pressure, feeling unearned despite embodied shiver.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via sensory density building to Charged Poise closure—identity reconfiguration with felt cost of enduring collective weight; orientation anchors early, single-shard flow legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory and rain-slick forecourt constrain descent and crystal touch, mirroring internal anticipation to peace; selective sensory hierarchy (ozone, wet stone) charges final fade without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of identity-sculpting signaled early and deepens via memory surge narrowing to guardian realization; introspective pressure coherent under accumulative lens but lacks sharp trade-off or live option foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Collective memory theme emerges implicitly from conjecture and echoes, reweighted in final belonging without moralizing; resonant hush image answers preservation question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases toward shadows/scents, with stable close-third POV and rhythmic modulation; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in closure hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("collective memory" churn, "settle over her" twice) and repetitive shadow phrasing dull late momentum; overwriting in memory flood mixes metaphors without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh archivist premise with crystal-memory synthesis transforms preservation trope; specific terms like "summer-quill" and shadow conjecture feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
