<question>1</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>No concrete interiority or contradictory impulses in scene; visionary's motivation told via summaries without micro-choices or embodied costs under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and holds to CR closure in final legacy image, but lacks density increase or cadence shift tightening stake; orientation anchors early, cost felt obliquely in steadfast isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cobalt glass portico recurs as micro-setting constraining perception and charging final beacon image; storm sensory details selective and mirror internal shift effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of allegiance shift signaled early but no on-page reversal, agency, or deepening under lens; abstract pressures lack visceral test or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme of vision shaping history emerges from radio mosaic and shadows-to-dawn images; final CR reweights allegiance without overt moralizing, though some abstract assertions dilute subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with lyrical perceptual signature fitting prophetic stance; purposeful compression legible, but minor syntactic repetition dulls rhythm under sustained reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("visionary knew... realized... felt") and template cadence ("As [time], the visionary...") across middle; repetitive motifs like "unfold" and "new dawn" create redundancy dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fresh inflection in radio frequencies piecing prophet's rise transforms oracle trope; synthesis organic but risks conservative without bold structural risks.</comment>
