<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation to uncover truth clear and consistent, intensifying via letters' revelations; embodied shiver and pounding heart ground emotions, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—no micro-choices reveal value hierarchy under peak storm pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with because/therefore chain (paper trail → reassembly → location); Charged Poise closure at pulsating glow reconfigures options with felt cost (being watched, storms); one tightening via letters suffices, orientation anchored early in orchard intro.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (howling storms buffeting, sickly yellow glow) integrated into action pressure choices; recurring dust storms constrain navigation, final pulsating glow charges closure image purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover stillpoint truth) signaled early, tightens causally via reassembled letters narrowing to heart-location; agency in pushing through storms shows endurance with legible cost (shiver, ominous trees) at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of excavating complex truth from lies emerges organically via letters' deceit layers and final awe; stillpoint image offers resonant non-literal reweighting of skepticism without statement, inviting ambiguity on reality's veil.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with consistent observant perceptual signature (scanning ground, intuiting fragments); diction purposeful for post-apoc texture, but lacks rhythmic peaks under stress—no dialogue to test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Repetitive stems ("Aria began," "she [pushed/followed]") and paraphrase loops on motivation ("driven by desire to uncover truth") create template cadence across middle beats, dulling propulsion; minor synonym churn on "truth/lies."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh post-apoc orchard thriving amid radiation synthesizes conspiracy tropes with reality-thin stillpoint; diamond-as-anchor transforms curse legend organically through causal anchor role.</comment>
