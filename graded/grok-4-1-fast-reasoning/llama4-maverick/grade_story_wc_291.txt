<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Earnest interiority in artist's kinship and numbness, but unearned epiphanies like "lance the boil" use diagnostic label-speak without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to on-page CR closure ("they understood... about understanding themselves") via charged final image of emerging from mist; felt emotional cost legible in thawing numbness; orientation anchored immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mist and quarry vividly constrain perception and charge final image (emerging "brighter"); sensory details (dripping water, damp earth) selective and POV-filtered through artist's attuned brushstrokes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncovering hidden truths deepens accumulatively via talk and painting, forcing internal stance crystallization; cost felt in confronting numbness, but lacks sharp option-narrowing under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of empathy unifying opposites emerges organically from ribbon, cases, and portrait; final image resonates non-literally without moralizing, though detective's speech borders thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in textural details (mist interplay, brush scratches); sparse dialogue natural and subtextual, distinguishing detective's hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive mist swirls and paraphrase loops (multiple "sense of connection" variants) create template cadence, dulling propulsion in final third; overwriting in stacked descriptors obscures density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh parallel between face-blind essence-capture and detective's intuitive cases transformed via ribbon motif; familiar epiphany tropes limit boldness.</comment>
