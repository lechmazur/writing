<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear in Lena's role but lacks intensifying pressure or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; interiority concrete yet leans on summary labels like "inexplicable connection" without embodied conflict. Low-stakes endurance in scattering feels unearned amid pondering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in ash-scattering image reweighting transience; orientation anchored early in gallery. One tightening via Eli's arrival and explanation narrows interpretive options, but minimal causal linkages limit propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Gallery and mask details selective and purposeful, mirroring fragility; powder-coated frame integrates tactilely. Body anchors via rocking chair open, subtly constraining reverent stance, charging final gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (connection vs. duty) signaled early but remains abstract with no live opposition or narrowing; mild deepening in Eli dialogue, but no agency-driven reversal or visible cost beyond felt reverence. Pressure static under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Impermanence theme emerges organically from scattering but undermined by Eli's overt statements like "truth is not always what it seems," echoing thesis (penalty); final image resonant yet borders moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with art-biased perception; dialogue natural and goal-pursuing (Eli explains inspiration). Mild uniformity in syntax and "sense of" phrasing dulls texture under reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("sense of longing/sadness/marvel" x4+), synonym churn (somber/melancholy), and template cadence in descriptions ("Lena's [noun]..., [emotion]") dull density, especially repetitive lingering gazes; artifacts pervade final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ash scatterer role offers fresh angle on transience via art disposal; mask and powder synthesize uniquely. Risks vignette familiarity without bold turns, but transforms reflection trope through occupation.</comment>
