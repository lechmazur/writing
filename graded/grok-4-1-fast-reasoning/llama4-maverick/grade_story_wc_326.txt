<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority concrete in heartbeats but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; epiphanic shift to "fetching wisdom from the failure" feels unearned without prior micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase via ink patterns and ghost coalescence; CR lands on-page in shard-dropping image reweighting transience with felt acceptance cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Snow-shrouded observatory and porcelain shard constrain mood and charge final image; sensory details (ink swirls, shard glow) mirror internal unraveling without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand ghost) deepens accumulatively through ink study and ghost shaping; agency in pouring ink narrows knowledge, but stakes remain abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of transience emerges organically from ink/snow/shard motifs shifting to wisdom-from-failure; final shard "falling like snowflakes" offers resonant non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with biased perceptual signature (heartbeats, glows); rhythmic texture fits accumulative mode, though minor repetition edges toward uniformity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Template cadence from repeated "As [temporal], [description]" openings across night-wearing paragraphs dulls propulsion; paraphrase loops on "sense of [peace/solace]" create redundancy in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital ghost with analog ink/porcelain in observatory frame transforms afterlife trope; shard's inevitable drop feels earned through poetic particulars.</comment>
