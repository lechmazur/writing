<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>No micro-choices or embodied contradictions under pressure; abstract traits like "scarred" and "hard softness" told without actions revealing hierarchy of values or flaws complicating stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with CR closure in final messenger realization and box reprise (felt cost of fractured soul); orientation anchors early, but lacks tightening or pattern break beyond repetitive density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Moonlit path and gravel crunch provide selective sensory grounding mirroring internal shift, charging final harmony image; celestial repetition selective but tips overt without constraining choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Abstract stakes like pain translation never escalate via reversal, trade-off, or agency under Accumulative lens; no on-page test narrows options or shows cost beyond declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of pain-to-enlightenment emerges via box/moon images, but direct statements like repeated "universal language" and final moralizing ("messenger... vital message") replace resonant subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with lyrical perceptual signature biased toward nature/celestial; rhythmic modulation fits reflection, though minor elevated diction drift in epiphanies.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in "cracked porcelain box" (7+ repeats) and "universal language" (4+), plus template "As he... seemed" cadence dull momentum; overwrites closure beat with redundant figuratives.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Firefighter-with-mystic-box premise mildly transforms trauma trope via reflection, but enlightenment arc relies on stock symbolic journey without fresh synthesis or risk.</comment>
