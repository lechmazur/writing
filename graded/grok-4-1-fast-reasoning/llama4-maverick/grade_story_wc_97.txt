<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in lost love intensifies through refuge-seeking choices, embodied in fingers on keys and heart beating faster during film entry; meaningful endurance earned as she returns changed. Internal conflict shows in gazing at compasses vs. frozen clock, but resolves tidily without sustained contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the encore beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from piano lament to film entry deepening sorrow's reweighting, culminating in Charged Poise RR via final smile and mist swirl reconfiguring heart from heavy to light. One tightening via unplanned encore suffices; cost legible in "hold on to this moment" against horizon's night, forgoing eternal refuge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (wet stone/ozone, cool damp air) filters through POV urgency, with arbor mist constraining returns and charging final image. Film world's grey skies/still trees contrast arbor to mirror internal shift; recurring mist evolves causally from encircling to post-return embrace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape sorrow) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via film refuge deepening then encore cadence shift narrowing options to defiant return. Agency in threading reel/entering/encore forecloses stasis with felt cost of leaving peace, as horizon pressures crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of journey over destination emerges organically from clock/compasses/film particulars, reweighted in final compasses pointing to "new horizon" without moralizing. Resonance in non-literal answer to fate's binding: new melody echoes refuge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (music as vortex/tide, mist as swirling guide) modulates rhythmically from melancholy to defiant. Diction purposeful, syntax varies with intensity peaking in encore pour of "heart and soul."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm propulsive with varied openings, but minor paraphrase loops ("music faded away" x2, mist "swirled" x3) and dense figuration (vortex/fireflies) slightly dull high-pressure film entry without obscuring closure. High density in sensory images advances atmosphere without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal arbor-film refuge transforms loss tropes via projector manipulation and encore defiance; risk in nonlinear entry/return heightens emotional stakes organically.</comment>
