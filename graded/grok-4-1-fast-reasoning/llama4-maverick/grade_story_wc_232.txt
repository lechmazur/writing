<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear from father's promise but lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; interiority generic with stock epiphanies like "heart swelled" and "tears mingled." No genuine flaws complicate decisions, reducing change to unearned realization at note reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building images (chip, ants, cavern map) to CR closure in chamber reveal and receding creek, with emotional cost legible in tears and foreclosed paths ("path behind disappeared"). Causality thin—ants' lead whimsical without opposition; one tightening via trials suffices but lacks density payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Blooming cavern sensory details (scent, dripping, flowers retreating) selectively constrain choices and mirror internal surge; creek evolution pressures cavern edges, charging final peace image. Vivid integration into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfill promise) signaled early, deepens via trials/doorway with narrowing paths, but pressure abstract—rising creek complicates without visceral test of resolve. Agency in following/choosing lacks trade-off; cost emotional but not tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of guided discovery emerges via nature motifs reweighting legacy, resonant in chip's final glimmer without moralizing. Complexity lingers in joy/sadness mix, but recurrences feel insistent rather than emergent from conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with consistent perceptual bias toward symbols/relics; rhythmic prose modulates mildly with intensity. No dialogue; diction purposeful but lacks peak compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("glimmer" x6, "promise fulfilled" variants, "creek" receding repetitions) and synonym churn dull closure image; template cadence in descriptive runs ("As [element]..., [Emilia]..."). Density low with redundant motifs overwriting pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Ants-to-cavern map path fresh inflects treasure trope via whimsy/intuition, but arc derivative (journey-discovery-epiphany) with templated reiterations limiting boldness.</comment>
