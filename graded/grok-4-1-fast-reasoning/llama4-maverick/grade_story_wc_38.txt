<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to escape via code-breaking is consistent but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; epiphanies like "encrypt vulnerability as strength" feel told without embodied conflict. Internal change to liberation reads unearned amid competent puzzle-solving without genuine struggle or micro-choices revealing value hierarchy. No safety-hedging flaws complicate peak decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with motif density (dice, dance, web, journal) building to Charged Poise closure as Aria exits with talisman dice, reconfiguring entrapment to empowerment; cost felt in transformative defiance. Orientation anchors early (Aria trapped in sunken lab deciphering records). Single continuous scene fits scope; no causal breaks, but lacks one decisive tightening beyond pattern cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sensory details (saltwater/decay scent, echoing footsteps, dim light) integrate purposefully, mirroring internal patterns via spider web; lab constrains via isolation but charges final image indirectly through web's completion paralleling journal. Micro-setting (dice as handled object) reweights meaning at exit. Selective POV filter on symbols avoids catalog; coherent choreography in single room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape via decoding) signaled early with accumulative pressure from "eternity" trapped and spider timeframe narrowing options to final encoding; one deepening via surge of determination forces stance crystallization. Agency in journaling/dancing shows endurance, but external conflict abstract, lacking live trade-off or visible price beyond felt resolve. Coheres under textural lens without reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of patterning chaos into strength emerges organically from motifs (dance as code, web/journal parallels), resonating in final image of shimmering web and liberated exit reweighting vulnerability. Subtext in symbolic kinship (spider) avoids direct statement until late; ambiguity lingers in "mysterious familiarity." Repeated "calm defiance" borders overt but ties to arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature on patterns/symbols; voice modulates slightly via swaying rhythm but risks monotony in syntax. No dialogue or head-hopping; purposeful compression in repetitive motifs taught early, legible at closure. Diction fits code-breaker's symbolic lens without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("calm defiance" x3, "mysterious familiarity" x2, dice significance restated across paragraphs) and synonym churn ("intricate patterns" variants) dull momentum; template cadence in "As she [action], [reflection]" runs obscure cause/effect. Figurative density overwrites without payoff in peak encoding beat. Read-aloud rhythm drags from syntactic similarity; info density low amid redundancies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh lyric synthesis of code-breaking as dance/pattern-weaving in surreal sunken lab transforms trapped-genius trope via spider/dice motifs risking bold accumulative structure. Final reconfiguration feels earned from particulars; no close famous echoes. Voice commits to idiosyncratic symbolic stance without hedging.</comment>
