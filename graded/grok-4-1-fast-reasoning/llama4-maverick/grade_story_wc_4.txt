<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; traits like "perceptively calm" are labeled without testing via conflict; motivation remains declarative, unearned by causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens inferred and holds, with serenity building via sensory density; but no meaningful tightening, cadence shift, or legible cost at closure—"as she disappeared into the distance" lacks reconfiguration or price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (lavender scent, bee hum, light dance) integrate purposefully, mirroring internal peace; factory ruins/lavender contrast charges thematic images without constraining choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>No dominant stake escalation under accumulative lens; abstract "collective healing" faces zero opposition or deepening; no on-page reversal, trade-off, or cost narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Beauty-in-decay theme emerges via images (vines on ruins) but undermined by direct statement—"transmute pain into a masterpiece"—replacing implication; lacks resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with calm, detail-oriented perceptual signature suits archivist; rhythmic modulation falters in repetitive phrasing, but no head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("sense of peace" x2, lavender scent x3, vines climbing x4) and synonym churn (serenity/tranquility) across paragraphs dull propulsion; template cadence in descriptive runs obscures closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Fresh lavender/factory juxtaposition transforms decay trope organically; vignette limits bold reconfiguration, feeling more meditative template than risky synthesis.</comment>
