<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Minimal internal conflict or contradictory impulses; success at dust swirl feels unearned without embodied struggle or micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. Obsession told via summary ("driven her for years") rather than shown in pivotal transcription beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from static to crescendo swirl; on-page Charged Poise closure in dust storyform and lingering glow, cost felt in years' dedication. Lacks reversal; magic activates without opposition tightening options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dust motes and radio glow recur to constrain perception and charge final image, evolving from dancing to swirling narrative vortex. Sensory integration vivid and POV-filtered through copyist's focus on melody amid mist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher broadcast for dust stories) signaled early with one accumulative tightening at lyrics crescendo, but no live opposition or foreclosed option; success too frictionless.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of narrative rebirth emerges organically from dust/music interplay, resonant in final alcove portal image reweighting solitude to sanctuary. Minor sentimentality in "unwavering dedication" softens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in musical/misty noticing; rhythmic modulation supports thistled calm texture. No dialogue; minor repetition borders uniformity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in "mist-shrouded," "dust motes dancing/swirling," and "thistled calm" repeats dull closure image; overwriting with metaphors in every crescendo sentence obscures propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh magical realism synthesis of dust narratives, pirate radio, and copyist obsession transforms tropes organically. Risky mist/dust lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
