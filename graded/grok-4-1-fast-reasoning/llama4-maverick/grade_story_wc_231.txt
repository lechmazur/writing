<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Characterization relies on passive observation without embodied contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; Kael's interiority tells curiosity and realization ("Kael realized, the boutonnière was a key") rather than showing through specific actions. No higher-stakes decisions emerge to compel change. Flaws like skepticism don't complicate pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of observations building to Conceptual Repricing closure: Kael clutching boutonnière reconfigures borrowed memories with felt cost ("weight of the memories, a cumulative burden"). Orientation anchored early. One tightening via stranger's gaze suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist, opal dock, and lighthouse constrain isolation and charge final image (Kael bending to retrieve boutonnière amid swirling mist). Sensory details (salt, damp earth) selective via Kael's priorities. Atmosphere mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode gesture) signaled early but escalates mildly via accumulative observations without agency-driven narrowing of options or visible trade-off; realization feels observational, not forced by coherent pressure. Cost legible in final burden but undercharges due to passivity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed memories and isolation emerges organically from particulars like stranger's inhalation and Kael's retrieval, reweighting lighthouse legend in final image without moralizing. Subtext in gazes and gaps invites ambiguity. Resonance ties to central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (noticing scuffed shoes, drifting eyes). Voice texture consistent in rhythmic, poetic diction ("mist swirled around them, a softly persistent presence"). No dialogue; compression purposeful and legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive loops ("mist swirled" x3, "Kael stood there" x2, "softly persistent" echoed) and paraphrase redundancy ("lost in thought," "gaze seemed drawn") dull propulsion in middle beats; −1.1 total for spread. Some overwriting in descriptive runs, but closure image clear.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystic lighthouse lore with specific Edelweiss and gap-observation method transforms tropes organically. Risk in accumulative quiet ending heightens isolation stakes. No close famous echoes.</comment>
