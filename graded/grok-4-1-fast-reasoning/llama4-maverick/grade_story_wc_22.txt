<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Motivation to reclaim land consistent and intensifies mildly through action, but interiority generic with stock phrasing like "deep understanding"; no contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from journey to planting; closure as Charged Poise in survey of "garden reborn from the ashes," reconfiguring desolation with felt dedication cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sensory details like "sweet scent of blooming flowers" and bird calls filter through coachman's attuned perception, evolving with action; twilight and jetty subtly guide halt and planting, charging final glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of garden reclamation signaled early but lacks reversal or deepening under lens; serene completion without narrowed options or visible trade-off flattens pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of subsurface harmony emerges via shifting images from dying reef to blooming promise; final survey offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting battlefield scars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with nature-biased perceptual signature; lyrical diction and rhythm modulate consistently, fitting accumulative texture without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Repetitive loops like "sweet scent of blooming flowers" (twice) and bird calls create paraphrase churn dulling propulsion; abstract phrases like "narrow vastness" add overwriting without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coachman as nature-healer transforming battlefield via seeds and bird lore; avoids tropes through specific vision but hedges on bold risks.</comment>
