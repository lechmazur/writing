<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Motivation told abstractly without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; pivotal realization ("Elian felt an inexplicable connection") lacks internal conflict or prior causality. Interiority defaults to stock epiphanies and diagnostic labels like "retrocognitively trapped." No genuine flaws complicate choices, yielding passive endurance without visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure ("weave its secrets into their next hedge maze design"), cost felt in blurred boundaries. Orientation anchored early. But outline-like sequencing of perceptions lacks tightening; fading photo pays off weakly without narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Garden details vivid and selective (scent, chirping, dappled shadows), evolving causally into "dreamscape" mirroring internal shift. Sensory hierarchy fits designer's attuned eye; paths subtly guide navigation to clearing. No constraint on pivotal fragment touch caps at strong band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stake ("discover the texture of time") signaled but abstract; textural deepening via fragment glow reweights awareness once. No agency-driven reversal or visible trade-off; passive realizations like "boundaries began to blur" lack opposition or cost legibility under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of time's texture emerges via fragment/photo images, resonant in final weave. But platitudes ("gentle unfolding of a lotus flower") and abstract philosophizing dilute emergence. No non-literal answer reweights prior material cleanly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature of pattern/time attunement. Voice texture poetic but drifts to academic register ("hyperbolic geometry") mismatched to earth-toned hedge designer. Rhythmic control supports wonder without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting with figurative density in peak beats ("dissolving into a quaking reverie," "rhythm of the universe"); mixed metaphors strain coherence. Paraphrase loops restate awe ("disorienting, yet exhilarating" echoes "exhilarating and terrifying"). Template cadence in sequential perceptions dulls propulsion through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hedge mazes, halo fragment, and hyperbolic geometry transforms time trope organically. Metaphysical odyssey risks bold but avoids gimmickry. Transformation test passes: specifics anchor premise uniquely.</comment>
