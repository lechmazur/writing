<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Unearned epiphanies like "truly become the voice of the unknown" in the vast cavern undermine closure; interiority relies on stock phrasing ("driven by a desire," "deep sense of connection") without contradictory impulses acting in scene. No micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values. Flaws like diagnostic self-awareness flatten emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with sensory density building to Charged Poise closure ("found her voice... ready to share"), cost felt in endurance of darkness. But no meaningful tightening/deepening narrows options; exploration wanders without reversal, orientation clear early. Meandering structure dilutes drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Bioluminescent fungi, salt/seaweed scents, and dripping water vividly constrain navigation and charge heat-maps; cave's narrow passage and vast cavern mirror internal states through action. Sensory hierarchy reflects Aria's priorities. Recurring cave pressures subtle choices effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early but static; no on-page reversal, deepening, or agency foreclosing a path under accumulative lens—density rises but doesn't reweight with visible cost. Mysteries declared but never tested concretely. No trade-off charges final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme of bridging past/present via objects emerges but via direct statements ("transitional objects... bridge the past and present"); final paragraphs moralize ("found her voice... at peace") replacing image resonance. Lacks non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with sensory-biased perceptual signature; voice modulates poetically through exploration. Rhythmic control supports texture without head-hopping. Minor register elevation in epiphanies fits lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("deep connection/sense," "full of secrets/mysteries," "undeterred/undaunted") and repetitive stems ("As she... felt") create template cadence across descriptions, dulling propulsion (−0.8 artifacts). Low density with redundant telling in peak cavern beat. Rhythm varies but overwriting obscures closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions and factually mystical fossil transform explorer trope into fresh sensory premise. Post-hibernation cave yields original synthesis. No close echoes; risk in abstract mapping pays off organically.</comment>
