<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete in tactile wood handling but relies on summary labels like "sense of rust-hued peace" without embodied contradictions acting simultaneously; motivation to process grief clear and consistent but lacks micro-choices revealing value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with carving density building to Charged Poise closure in final carving completion and sad smile; cost legible in "pain of her loss slowly begin to contain"; orientation anchored early in loft and widow's grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory details like rain sounds, wood grain, tea aroma integrate purposefully, mirroring internal states; loft as micro-setting grounds meditative process, with ash wood constraining craft choices and charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of containing grief signaled early via carving; accumulative tightening through carving progress and thought deepening narrows to managed endurance; cost felt in ongoing pain acknowledgment but lacks sharper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of loss as "here and gone" emerges organically from carving and kettle image; final reconfiguration reweights grief via completed form without moralizing, inviting ambiguity in hope amid pain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias to wood textures and rain; voice rhythmic and selective in noticing craft details; purposeful poetic compression taught early suits accumulative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive "sense of" phrasing and paraphrase loops like multiple "peace settle" instances create synonym churn dulling density; figurative "rust-hued peace" overwrites without pattern payoff in peak reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Grief-via-craft familiar but lion tamer widow and ash wood add specific flavor; lacks bold risk or non-obvious synthesis, reading as solid but untransformed template arc.</comment>
