<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and alchemist-specific, but diagnostic label-speak like "luminous regret" dominates realizations without embodied contradiction; no micro-choices under pressure test motives, flattening pivotal epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Conceptual Repricing closure in final image of peace; cost felt in tempered regret, but minimal tightening beyond reflective progression weakens drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rain-washed foundry vividly anchors and mirrors internal rebirth through sensory details like wet earth and molten scents; zodiac coin as micro-setting charges final glow, constraining her talisman-driven experiments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant redemption stake signaled early with one deepening via experiments, but escalation abstract and told rather than agent-driven under accumulative lens; cost legible in foreclosed perfection path but lacks visceral narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of brokenness beauty emerges via kintsugi and coin images, resonating in final reconfiguration; overt statements like "true beauty lay not in perfection" verge on thematic echo, diluting subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature in mystical-alchemical noticing; rhythmic prose modulates effectively, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("rain-washed," "luminous regret," "stories that the flaws told") create paraphrase churn across realizations, dulling closure image; overwriting metaphors in peak reflective beats obscure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Synthesizes alchemist tropes with kintsugi for fresh redemption angle, but prompt-like elements (zodiac coin, weight of names) feel stitched without bold transformation.</comment>
