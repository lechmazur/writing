<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to reclaim the throne is consistent but lacks internal contradiction or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; no embodied flaws complicate choices at pivotal discovery of murals or throne climb, rendering her archetypal rather than particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore progression from flake to murals to path reveal to throne claim; on-page DC closure as she sits with binding cost felt in "forever bound to this place"; orientation anchored early, one tightening via cryptic message suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (scents, chirping, shimmering leaves) filters through Aria's priorities, with orchard trees parting to constrain/reveal path and charge final ascent; recurring waterfall/trees subtly mirror nostalgic restoration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find stairway to throne before sunrise) signaled early with causal tightening via murals/message narrowing options; time pressure escalates agency in peeling and following light, but low opposition limits reversal depth at climax; cost legible in binding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of hubris-fallen civilization reclaimed emerges organically from murals' history and final throne image reweighting past whispers to future promise; resonant CR in sunlit ruins without moralizing, though murals' tale borders direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward lore-seeking details; distinct rhythmic texture modulates from anticipatory to triumphant, with purposeful poetic compression legible under causal lens; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but minor paraphrase loops ("weight... settling" repeated twice) and repetitive "knew that" stems dull momentum in mid-murals beat; figurative language coherent without muddle, rhythm varies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sci-fi quest tropes (magical guide object, hidden path to throne) transformed via futuristic nostalgia and cybernetic orchard details, but core hero's journey arc feels familiar without bold risk or non-obvious synthesis at closure.</comment>
