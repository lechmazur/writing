<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Label-speak dominates ("desperately jocular demeanor faltered," "deep-seated pain"); interiority summarized rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. Motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Final change feels told, not earned via on-page causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rumor density builds to RR closure (Raven slips away with lifted loneliness, cost in revealed pain). Single scene oriented early (station, Raven, crowd by para 1). Tell-heavy summary weakens beat propulsion, but legible cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ivy tendrils as "skeletal fingers" anchors and mirrors Raven's loneliness, constraining navigation through crowd. Atmosphere shifts purposefully from despair to community via selective sensory buildup. Environment charges opening and subtly guides connection-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cure loneliness via catalyzed community) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as crowd animates. Agency in whispering rumors narrows options, but pressure remains low-textured without on-page trade-off or opposition testing commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of connection as incremental cure emerges organically from rumor spread to reciprocity. Final image (Raven smiling into night) offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor telling ("cure for loneliness was not a single event") dilutes subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (eyes scanning desperate crowd). Prose texture distinct in rhythmic similes, modulating with intensity. No dialogue; compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound ("sense of possibility," "sense of community," "sense of purpose" cluster); simile stacks overload ("ivy... skeletal fingers," "gentle virus"). Template cadence in repeated "as [they] [action]" stems drags momentum. Rewrites needed for density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of logistician using moon rock rumors as "gentle virus" for kindness transforms tropes. Closing reconfiguration (rock forgotten, community endures) feels inevitable. Risks polite anarchy tone amid summary.</comment>
