<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Generic leader traits told via summary ("gently persistent nature") without contradictory impulses or embodied micro-choices during pivotal speech; interior pride and purpose labeled, not dramatized under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of communal resolve; single scene anchors early (arbor, night gathering); Charged Poise closure in final cottage image reconfigures resilience with felt cost of ongoing sanctions, but lacks tightening reversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Specifics like lanterns on pillars, terra-cotta arbor, and blooming flowers integrate tactilely into action; arbor as recurring site charges symbolic strength without overtness; sensory hierarchy fits calm communal focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sanctions endurance) signaled but abstract, no on-page reversal or agency narrowing options; speech declares resolve without testing trade-offs under lens, keeping pressure declarative over visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Solidarity theme emerges from gathering images but leans on direct statements ("we will not be broken"); final bell echo offers quiet resonance without moralizing overload.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with consistent perceptual bias toward communal warmth; dialogue sparse but natural/subtext-light; rhythmic warmth fits tone without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops restate unity/pride ("sense of pride," "quiet confidence," "heart full of hope") across paragraphs; repetitive soft/gentle stems create template cadence, dulling propulsion in speech peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Uplifting exile-community speech treads familiar resilience tropes without fresh angle or transformed particulars; bell motif adds mild distinction but premise feels template-derived.</comment>
