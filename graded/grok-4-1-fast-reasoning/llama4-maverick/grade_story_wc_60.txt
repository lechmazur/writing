<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Traits like "luminous skeptic" and "sidereal patience" are labeled early but not embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; solo Aria lacks internal conflict beyond declarative determination, yielding archetypal feel without earned change at vow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with breadcrumb progression tightening to CR closure in memory release and fountain stir; orientation anchored early in city/fountains; smooth journey fits defaults but lacks persistent constraint shaping tactics beyond pathfinding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Forgotten fountains frame and evolve causally to revival, constraining path via alleys/waterways; sensory whispers/rustle/gurgle selective via Aria's bias; final stirring charges image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to liberate memories signaled early with accumulative deepening via shards/door/box, but low opposition yields static pressure; responsibility cost felt at end but lacks live option foreclosure mid-journey.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of patient rediscovery emerges organically from quest particulars and goose/fountain reprise reweighting history's loss; resonant CR in city's rebirth avoids moralizing; ambiguity in ongoing task lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in clue-attuned noticing; lyrical diction/rhythm modulates journey's hush to triumphant close; purposeful compression legible without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in "forgotten" repetitions and "as she" stems dull density slightly; rhythm varies but overwriting in descriptive runs (e.g., sun-set glow) risks scaffold without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fable-quest via glass shards as breadcrumb evolution and fountain rebirth; transforms tropes through textural imagery without gimmickry; voice/setting cohere memorably.</comment>
