<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during climax confrontation; motivation to uncover letters' truth remains abstract without micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density rising to entity formation and dissipation; closure as Charged Poise/CR in final reflection ("she had been changed") with legible cost of carrying unspoken essence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (damp earth scent, luminescent fungi) constrain navigation and charge final healing/reflection image; mangrove paths and moonlight subtly guide evocation choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evoke letters' truth) signaled early, escalates via spirits' crescendo and entity solidification under accumulative lens; agency in raising shard/speaking forecloses uncertainty with felt emotional unraveling cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken regret emerges organically from letters/manifestation/dissipation; final image of clutched shard and carried essence offers resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice consistent with perceptual signature (primordial aromas resonating deeply); stable single POV, purposeful rhythm modulates intensity, though minor compression in peak lacks extreme stress degradation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on spirits' voices ("grew louder... crescendo... fever pitch") and repetitive "Aria's presence"/"began to" stems dull climax propulsion; some overwriting reduces density in revelation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ingenious suspended windowpane and shard ritual in spirit-haunted mangroves synthesize fresh evocation frame; transforms medium trope through specific, grounded sorrow release without gimmickry.</comment>
