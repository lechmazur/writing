<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria's pacifism is told via summary ("preferring instead to sheathe it") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; motivation feels declarative rather than intensifying through scene actions. No internal conflict acts simultaneously; traits like "senselessly perceptive" are labeled without particularized perception driving struggle. Stock serenity dominates without flaws complicating choices or visible cost on pivotal endurance beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and holds, with closure as Charged Poise in final sleep image reconfiguring chaos/peace with felt opportunity cost (sword relic). But no meaningful tightening or cadence shift; beats are and-then summaries without pressure narrowing options. Orientation anchors early (Aria in glass-domed farm post-tower), but vignette stasis lacks plot drive testing stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glass-domed enclosure vividly filters light and hums with scents, constraining Aria's sanctuary against outer ruins; repurposed wreckage planter charges final rose image. Sensory selection (rustle, filtering light) reflects serene POV bias, integrated into tending actions. Recurring stone subtly mirrors internal quiet without overt symbolism; strong micro-setting specificity elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>No dominant stake tightening under Accumulative lens; "weave continuity through chaos" declared early but never faces on-page test or reversal, remaining abstract. No agency foreclosing path with cost—pacifism endures statically without pressure or trade-off. World chaos externalized off-page, undercutting visceral stakes in serene scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of nurturing peace vs. violence emerges via rose/sword contrast and final "tranquil blaze" image, offering non-literal resonance without full moralizing. But overt statements ("embody the principles of peace") border on thesis articulation; subtext diluted by direct "engraved quiet" echoes. Complexity lacks via unchallenged harmony, no counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in plant responsiveness; voice lyrical, modulating rhythm in descriptions. Elevated diction ("senselessly perceptive") fits but drifts slightly poetic without peak stress test. No dialogue or head-hopping; compression purposeful for accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("sense of tranquility," "reminder of") and synonym churn ("serene," "peaceful," "quiet") across paragraphs dull momentum, with template cadence in repetitive sentence stems ("As she worked..."). Overwriting stacks adjectives in high-density beats without payoff; final image softened by redundancy. Read-aloud rhythm monotones despite varied lengths.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Ingenuity in "inculcating plants with values" transforms post-apoc oasis trope via quirky method, feeling organic to pacifist arc. But core pacifist-chooses-peace frame hedges bold risks, with elements like "engraved quiet" stone feeling stitched rather than inevitable synthesis. Fresh angle on wreckage-as-planter recharges mildly.</comment>
