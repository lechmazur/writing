<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in quest for secrets, intensifying via doodle realization, but lacks contradictory impulses or embodied flaws acting in scene; interiority tells "latent blaze" without micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of glimpses and patterns builds to CR closure in tomes' revelation with responsibility cost legible in "weight of her discovery"; orientation anchored early in manuscript scene; one tightening via doodle-as-map.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details (crackled parchment, damp earth scent, swirling mist) selectively guide navigation and mirror internal attunement; grotto constrains choices during inversion, charging final emergence image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover seeds/combinations) signaled early, tightens via threshold glimpses narrowing to alcove; agency in reentering and following mental map forecloses doubt with reluctance cost, but abstract vigilance lacks visceral test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of nurturing vigilance emerges organically from serpent/seed motif shifting to tangible force; final smile reconfigures journey as ongoing without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of endless secrets.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with prism-minded perceptual bias (hidden patterns, connections); rhythmic prose modulates from study calm to grotto intensity; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("mist swirled" reprise, "felt" in attunement/weight) and synonym churn (glow/shimmer/luminous) dull density slightly; vivid propulsion overall, but elevated diction ("clandestinely luminous") clashes mildly in action beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inversion physics and symbolic doodle transforms quest trope; gravity flip and threshold effects offer non-obvious angle, but familiar archivist arc limits bold risk.</comment>
