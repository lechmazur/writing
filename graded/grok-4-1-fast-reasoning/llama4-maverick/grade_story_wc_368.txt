<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete in precise movements but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; epiphany feels summarized without micro-choices revealing flaws under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with early orientation and CR closure in realization of wing's link to human allure; conceptual cost legible in "deepening understanding... iridescent caution" reconfiguring premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wing and light constrain choices, charge final image mirroring insight; sensory details filtered through dye master's color bias integrate purposefully without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlocking wing's secrets tightens accumulatively via sun descent but remains abstract; no sharp option-narrowing or visible trade-off in serene progression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of refractive allure emerges organically from observation to CR realization without moralizing; final image reweights wing-human parallel resonantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with dye master perceptual signature on light/colors; rhythmic, mystical prose modulates serenely without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("iridescent caution," "valley-mist wonder") creates minor loops and paraphrase in descriptive beats, dulling density without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of morpho wing iridescence as charisma metaphor transforms contemplative trope organically; sun-trail tracking adds specific ingenuity.</comment>
