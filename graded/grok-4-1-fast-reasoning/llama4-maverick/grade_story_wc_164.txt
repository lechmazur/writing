<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via hum and glass-touching shows particular traits, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during pivotal chamber discovery; emotional labels like "cheerful gloom" feel diagnostic without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from seeds trail to chamber CR closure ("grasp the truth... flux and transformation"); cost legible in "carry this understanding... even as memory fades"; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Geode's crystalline paths and light shafts constrain movement and charge final emergence image; sensory details (echoing footsteps, shimmering pools) selectively mirror emotional flux without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (paths disappearing) signaled early and tightens via seeds trail forcing deeper delve; agency in deciphering yields CR, but lacks opposition or trade-off to raise visible cost under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory's flux emerges implicitly from symbols' narrative and glass reprise without moralizing; final image reconfiguration ("cheerful gloom... forever") offers non-literal resonance to pursuit-of-knowledge question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in transliterated hums and glowing-glass notices; stable single POV with rhythmic modulation suits lyric aims, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetitive "felt [emotion/state]" (joy, wonder, gratitude, weight) and "As she [moved], [perceived]" stems create template cadence across reflective beats, dulling propulsion; minor paraphrase loops in geode glow descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sea-foam recollectionist, geode-paths-as-memory, and bird-seeds trail transforms introspection trope; risk-taking in lyric conceit heightens stakes organically.</comment>
