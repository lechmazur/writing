<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Label-heavy interiority like "trembling certainty" and "analytically artistic" lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices revealing values; change feels unearned without prior causal pressure on impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via deepening mist density and arrow guidance to RR closure ("mind transformed...changed her forever"); legible conceptual cost in foreclosed old worldview.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mist and ethereal glow constrain path choices and charge final cleared-mist image; sensory selection reflects artistic POV priorities without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmospheric density escalation under Accumulative lens tightens discovery stake via punch vibration and light dare; protagonist agency in following forecloses uncertainty with transformation cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Final glowing punch and cleared mist offer non-literal resonant answer to mystery stakes, reweighting uncertainty into possibility through journey particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases toward patterns suits Accumulative lens; stable close-third distance with purposeful rhythmic modulation, no slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive "felt" stems (12+ instances) and "seemed/as if" qualifiers form template cadence and paraphrase loops in progression beats, dulling propulsion despite vivid density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Phantom punch and pavement arrows synthesize surreal ingenuity into discovery trope, with risk-taking in accumulative surrealism heightening transformation stakes.</comment>
