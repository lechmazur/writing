<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Aria's traits like "insatiably creative spirit" are labeled without contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; no internal conflict or earned change, just serene affirmation. Pruning and planting align superficially with motives but reveal no flaws or blind spots. Single-POV interiority defaults to poetic telling over embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to transformation, single scene anchored early ("verdant parapet beside a roaring waterfall"). Closure as Charged Poise in final image ("radiant hush, a reminder of the magic") reconfigures wonder with felt fulfillment cost, but lacks persistent constraint shaping tactics. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sensory details like "sweet scent of blooming flowers" and "gentle roar of the falls" integrate purposefully, mirroring internal peace; waterfall evolves to "shimmering veil, a gateway." Setting guides spell-weaving subtly but does not constrain pivotal choices. POV-filtered hierarchy favors natural wonder over occupational specifics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("preserve the color of wonder") signaled early but no tightening or reversal under Accumulative lens; serene progression lacks narrowing options or visible cost beyond vague "energy flowing." No agency-tested pressure or trade-off charges closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of renewal emerges organically from seed-planting and weaving images, resisting tidy morals via blurred world boundaries. Final image ("stars shone brightly overhead, a celestial map") offers non-literal resonance reweighting creativity's legacy. Repetition risks overtness without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in nature-infused diction ("weave a subtle spell"); rhythmic modulation suits lyric Accumulative mode. No dialogue or head-hopping; purposeful poetic compression legible at closure. Minor syntactic uniformity under peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound ("world... a more wondrous place, full of vibrant colors"; repeated "weave," "wonder," "radiant hush" across paragraphs), triggering −1.2 for redundancy dulling propulsion. Overwriting with stacked metaphors ("fabric of reality, thread... strong and resilient") muddles in descriptive beats. Rhythms vary but template cadence in transformations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes (magical seed restores land) lack fresh synthesis; poetic orchard pruner feels derivative without bold risks. Transformation via "weaving between worlds" organic but not inevitable hindsight. Voice coheres as singular stance amid familiarity.</comment>
