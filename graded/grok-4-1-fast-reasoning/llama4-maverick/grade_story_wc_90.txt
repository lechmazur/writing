<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Pacifism is consistent but ornamental, with no contradictory impulses tested under pressure; interiority concrete in stitching but lapses into label-speak like "shadow work" without embodied crisis depth, diluting closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Oriented early in corridors to bay; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as stitching density deepens memories to CR closure—"the locked dimension creaked open"—with fading presence as legible conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Recycled spaceship and storage bay selective/sensory (aged paper scent, dried tears shimmer); recurring Tear and photos constrain stitching choice and charge closure glow/stillness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (open dimension) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via memory immersion to final stitch reversal; agency in confronting psyche shows cost in emotional weight, charging Aurora's fade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of shadow work/compassion emerges organically from stitching/images, resonates in final Tear stillness reweighting transformation without moralizing; minor abstraction in "indomitable will" platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with ethereal perceptual signature (soothing metal, pulsing light); rhythmic prose modulates to charged poise at end, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("felt the weight... settling upon her" twice; "faint shimmer of long-dried tears" exact repeat) and "As she" template stems dull mid-section density; figurative density overwrites without peak restraint.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-human pacifist stitching tears/shadow work to unlock dimension transforms sci-fi tropes organically; Tear's evolution feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
