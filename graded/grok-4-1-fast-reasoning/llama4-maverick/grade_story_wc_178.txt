<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Astronomer's empirically ironic nature is labeled but never shown through contradictory impulses in micro-choices; abstract summaries of wonder ("inner fire", "overwhelming urge") replace embodied conflict, diluting motivation at the pivotal deciphering beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure ("astronomer's essence merging"), cost legible in submersion of irony; orientation anchored early in palace/tile setup, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tile as recurring micro-setting charges final image ("pulsed with a soft, ethereal glow"); selective sensory details (shimmering symbols, fading light) filter through POV wonder, though palace remains atmospheric without constraining choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decipher/seal covenant) deepens accumulatively to harmony resonance, but abstract stakes lack visceral test or trade-off; no opposition narrows options, weakening escalation before tile-raising climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of celestial-terrestrial unity emerges via tile images, final transcendence reweights premise without literal moral; repetitive "dusky harmony" borders on overt statement, reducing subtext in closing paragraphs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with mystical perceptual signature ("whispered tales", "vibrating in resonance"); rhythmic modulation suits accumulative tone, though elevated diction occasionally drifts from grounded astronomer lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound ("astronomer's connection... deepened", next line restates essence flow; "dusky harmony" repeats 3x without pattern payoff); figurative overload ("moonlight on a midnight lake", "wings of a dusky harmony") muddles peak beats, eroding density and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Babylonian palace + magic square synthesis offers fresh mystic angle on transcendence; however, trope-heavy epiphany arc lacks bold risk, feeling like transformed but familiar spiritual quest template.</comment>
