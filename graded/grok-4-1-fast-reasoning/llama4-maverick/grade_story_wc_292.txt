<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent but static, lacking micro-choices under pressure or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. "Nervously confident demeanor" label repeated without embodied tradeoffs or visible cost. No earned change or internal conflict in pivotal research beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>No on-page closure under Accumulative/Textural lens; lacks density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift reweighting stake with cost. Repetitive journal-deciphering beats without tightening or reversal. Ending blurs identity but forecloses no path with legible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong atmosphere via "air inside the dome grew thick with an eerie, spongey dread" mirroring internal state selectively. Sensory hierarchy fits urgency (humming systems, storm rage). No environment/body/tool constraining choice or charging final image, limiting 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth) signaled early but no meaningful tightening or deepening under Accumulative lens; dread accumulates statically without narrowing options. No agency-driven reversal or visible cost altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of reversible exile and hidden patterns emerges implicitly from journals/nail but lacks resonant non-literal answer reweighting prior material. Final image questions identity without charged reconfiguration or counter-reading complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward maps/journals; syntax modulates slightly with dread. Repetitive phrasing erodes distinct texture under stress, but no head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops (e.g., "Emilia's [trait] drove her" variants across paragraphs) and template cadence ("As the [time] wore on") dull propulsion. Redundant stems obscure cause/effect in dread-building beats; low density in peak summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coffin nail, coded sailor journals, and weather dome creates memorable frame. Tropes like "blurring reality" untransformed; no bold risk heightening stakes beyond buildup.</comment>
