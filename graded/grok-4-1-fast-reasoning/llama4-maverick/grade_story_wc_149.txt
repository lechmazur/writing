<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Alchemist remains passive observer without contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; ghost bride's motivation told repetitively ("debt she sought to repay") rather than embodied in pivotal interaction at bead grasp.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with bead grasp tightening to resonant reconfiguration; Charged Poise closure legible in ghost's fade and alchemist's understanding, cost felt in "sense of loss" amid enduring connection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Luminescent orbs and "scent of sandalwood and myrrh" selectively constrain ghost's cameo and charge final humming energy; sensory hierarchy mirrors alchemist's awakening without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlocking resonant awakenings signaled early, bead moment deepens via surge, but agency low—ghost guides passively; cost in ghost's dissipation visible but pressure atmospheric over agentic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of bittersweet guidance emerges organically from bead transformation and final "mournful elation" smile; reweights debt as lingering gift without moralizing, resonant non-literal close.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited stable with perceptual bias to ethereal ("dark pools of water" eyes); rhythmic modulation suits tone, no head-hopping, but occasional elevated diction borders register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in "ghost bride's presence" and repetitive "resonant awakenings" across final third dull propulsion (−0.8); synonym churn (ethereal light/glow) obscures closure image density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ghost bride trope transformed via "lovingly venomous intent" and bead as debt symbol; fresh alchemical resonance synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, risks poetic density effectively.</comment>
