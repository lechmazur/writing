<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dweller's interiority shines in the tape fragment sniff triggering vivid sense memory of childhood, rooting kindness and method in embodied nostalgia. Lacks contradictory impulses or pressured micro-choices, keeping changes serene rather than earned through conflict. No safety-hedging flaws complicate the gentle arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensory density builds from routine to memory flood to urgent caching, culminating in Charged Poise CR where patrons sense clues, reweighting invisibility with hopeful cost. Orientation anchors immediately in library/dawn/dweller. One tightening via tape discovery narrows to visibility drive without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pipe chases and flickering lights constrain uncovering actions, charging final image of hidden shelf as beacon. Sensory hierarchy (scents of dust/ink/metal over visuals) reflects dweller's tactile priorities. Details evolve causally from outage hum to sapphire lights awakening library.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (visibility via treasures) signaled early, tightens accumulatively post-memory with urgent caching. Cost legible in melting back into shadows despite clues left. No reversal, but endurance forecloses isolation path under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden hope emerges organically from tape-triggered memory and cached treasures becoming rumors. Final image reconfigures invisibility as gentle promise without moralizing. Sense memory particulars avoid platitudes, inviting ambiguity of being "seen" yet hidden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, with perceptual signature of grimy fingers/scents modulating serenely to urgent shine. Rhythmic compression suits accumulative hush-to-roar cadence. No dialogue or head-hopping; diction sensory-biased without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sensory propulsion vivid, but minor paraphrase loops ("hidden" x5, "shadows" motifs) and repetitive stems ("the dweller's [noun]") dull mid-density. No closure artifacts; rhythm varies with scene hush. Minor overwriting in "sapphire hush" reuse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh urban myth of methodical dweller caching memories transforms hermit trope via tape sense memory. Non-obvious synthesis of library labyrinth and visibility stakes feels organic. Risky lyric poise heightens quiet resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
