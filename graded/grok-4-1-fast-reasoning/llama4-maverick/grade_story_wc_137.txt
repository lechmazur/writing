<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Emilia's skepticism is named early but fades without contradictory impulses acting in scene; 'courageously kind determination' labels a surge without embodied micro-choices or visible internal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via deepening transcription density to conceptual repricing; closure lands on-page with perceptual reconfiguration cost in 'newfound appreciation' and tile's stillness foreclosing prior isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tower's latticework and sea anchor orientation while constraining solitary reflection; recurrent whale songs mirror attunement, charging final 'eternal symphony' image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of unlocking memories signaled early via tile; accumulation tightens through atmospheric shift and narrative reveal, reweighting isolation with peace as legible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of hidden interconnections emerges from tile transcription and whale harmony; final image resonantly reconfigures mundane reality without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with selective perceptual signature on symbols and rhythms; voice texture consistent but elevated diction occasionally drifts from grounded skepticism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on 'hidden patterns,' 'entangled memories,' and 'unheard symphony' across paragraphs dull propulsion; overwriting like 'alchemy of memory and imagination' muddles peak density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Synthesizes skeptic-mystic trope with whale-tile patterns for fresh resonance; lacks bold risk as revelation arc feels conventional despite specific sea-tower fusion.</comment>
