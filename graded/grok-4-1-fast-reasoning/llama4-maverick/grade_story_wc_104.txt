<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Traits like "patiently strategic mind" and "staggering grace" are labeled early without embodied contradiction or micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values; liberator reads archetypal with no flaws complicating decisions under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through linear journey from piano code to vault distribution, with CR closure in legacy image carrying conceptual cost of ongoing oppression; lacks pivotal reversal, as guards are slipped without tested opposition narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sensory details like "faint scent of sugar and smoke" and "yellowed keys" integrate purposefully into discovery action; carnival piano constrains decoding choice, charging early drive to vault.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seed access/distribution signaled via code reveal, with one causal tightening at arrow signal renewing resolve; escalation remains abstract as vault guards evade without agency-driven cost or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Resilience theme emerges accumulatively from wall/seeds/fields motif, with final lush fields reweighting premise non-literally; diluted by repetitive phrases like "testament to the power" bordering on echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with hopeful perceptual filter consistent through action; rhythmic texture supports accumulative build but lacks peaks modulating under peak stress like vault entry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in closing ("reminder," "testament," legacy restatements) and template cadence ("The liberator...") across multiple sentences dull propulsion; synonym churn on purpose/impact pervades final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Piano code to seed vault inflects liberation trope with agricultural ingenuity, feeling organic; arrow signal reprise adds fresh ally layer synthesizing chaos-to-hope arc.</comment>
