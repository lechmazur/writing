<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation to give rest a permanent address drives the arc credibly, but interiority defaults to summaries like "felt a sense of peace settle over him" without embodied contradiction; stubborn trait is labeled once without complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via building stillness holds to Charged Poise closure in final image of smiling contentment amid pulsing signal; one tightening at lens reassembly forecloses prior weariness with felt personal cost; orientation anchored swiftly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eerie stillness and icy waters constrain descent and exploration, with library's labyrinth charging climax; sensory details like flickering shadows integrate purposefully without catalog; recurring lens as micro-setting enables key choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of revitalizing signal for personal peace signaled early tightens accumulatively through descent and repair, narrowing to endurance as guardian; cost legible in remaining forever, but lacks deeper agency-driven reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of chased stillness emerging rest via purpose resonates through particulars like signal's tone shift from mournful to inviting; final image reconfigures premise without moralizing; ambiguity in eternal commitment lingers effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with consistent perceptual bias toward stillness; prose texture modulates rhythmically, but minor syntactic repetition under stress converges voice slightly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Repetitive paraphrase loops on "stillness," "peace," and "permanent address" (e.g., multiple "sense of peace" variants) create synonym churn dulling propulsion; template cadence in reflective beats like "as he pondered" runs; density suffers in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker guarding underwater library transforms death/rest tropes organically; risky beacon-of-stillness premise commits fully, with signal reprise heightening ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
