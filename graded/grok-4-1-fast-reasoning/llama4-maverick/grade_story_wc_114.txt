<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to uncover truth drives actions consistently, with fault-tolerant traits enabling persistence, but interior conflict remains summarized rather than shown through simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal note-taking beats; fever recovery provides embodied start, yet epiphanies border on unearned via abstract labels like "auroral sorrow."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from logbook scribbles to collaborative insights, culminating in on-page Conceptual Repricing ("truth was not a fixed... fluid, context-dependent construct") with legible cost in "auroral sorrow"; orientation anchored early at observation deck; single scene with time progression fits scope, one tightening via emerging picture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mountain weather station grounds action tactilely (metal grating, data streams, mists), with botanical illustration recurring to constrain perception and charge final image as "symbol of her journey"; sensory details selective (ozone, damp earth) mirror internal clarity post-fever; no spatial incoherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover swallowed truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via anomalies/outliers to fluid-truth realization under Textural lens, narrowing fixed-certainties option with felt sorrow cost; agency in probing/smudging yields one meaningful deepening without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of swaying certainties emerges organically from margins/logbook palimpsest and illustration reprise, reweighting truth as provisional in resonant final image without moralizing; subtext in fragile balance avoids binaries, lingering ambiguity charges closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (patterns in mist/data) biased toward oracle's intuitive lens; lyrical diction ("faint aurora," "palimpsest") modulates rhythm purposefully, consistent under pressure; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose propels with varied rhythm and density, but minor paraphrase loops ("hidden truth/patterns," "certainties swayed/balance") and repetitive abstract stems ("Aria felt...") dull peak realization beats without obscuring closure; metaphors coherent, no heavy artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle at weather station transforms truth-seeking trope via margins/palimpsest mechanics and fluid certainties, with risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightening resonance; no template echoes, organic particulars inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
