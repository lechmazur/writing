<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fisher's calm traits motivate consistent actions like zigzag walking and signing, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; renewal feels earned yet without a pivotal micro-choice revealing values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup (whispers to vibrations) yielding Charged Poise closure; final departing image reconfigures connection with felt cost of subtle changes and deepened bond.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Garden's sonic elements constrain voicing silence and charge final whisper-caress; constellations' mirroring shifts constrain perception and settle in ending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stake to catch echo escalates via textural intensification to vibration/hearing; endurance in voicing forecloses disconnection with cost in irrevocable renewal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of voiced silences blurring reality emerges via particulars; final trail of changes non-literally reweights magic's presence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with sonic-biased perceptual signature; rhythmic prose modulates attunement without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Repetitive "patterns break themselves" and sound-synonym loops (whispers/hum/vibrations) create paraphrase drag across beats, touching final echoes; rhythm otherwise propels.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sonic mysticism and pattern-breaking synthesize fresh angle on attunement; lyric risks heighten closure without gimmickry.</comment>
