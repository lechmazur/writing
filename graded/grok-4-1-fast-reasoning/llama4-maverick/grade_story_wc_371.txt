<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Noticer shows consistent traits via observations and returns to tea house, but lacks contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; gardener remains peripheral without status dynamics or crucible. Interiority concrete yet reflective without embodied conflict. Passive endurance yields low-stakes change, unearned for elite publication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: orientation anchored early in courtyard/tea house; progression via repeated visits builds to CR closure in final smile and bread realization with oblique seasonal cost. No shards or transitions overload; vignette coherence intact. Lacks tightening beyond gardener arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (scents, vines, fog) filter through noticer's priorities, subtly mirroring internal peace; tea house constrains returns and nurtures connection. Palace courtyard evolves minimally with gardener's tending. Purposeful over tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (absolution/sacred ordinary) signaled early but static; gardener introduces minor deepening via shared tending, yet no option-narrowing reversal or visible cost under Accumulative lens. Pressure remains gentle, untested on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of sacred ordinary emerges organically from tea/bread/gardening particulars, resonating in final image repricing bread as "key to unlocking deeper understanding." Avoids moralizing; ambiguity in renewal lingers. On-nose phrasing like "beacon of hope" slightly undermines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in noticing changes/foliage; rhythmic prose modulates reflective calm effectively. No dialogue or head-hopping. Diction purposeful, voice distinct without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies, vivid specificity replaces generics. Minor paraphrase loops in tea house descriptions ("vines and weathered wood") and repetitive stems ("she felt") drag momentum slightly, but no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "creeping normality noticer," guerrilla gardener, and vanished bakery transforms quiet reflection into quirky renewal arc; risk in vignette accumulation pays off in bread reprise. Avoids templates, feels organic vision.</comment>
