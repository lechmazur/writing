<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Uearned epiphanies dominate, like "she understood that she had to reconstruct her approach," with no contradictory impulses or micro-choices acting in scene; motivation told via summaries rather than embodied pressure. Interiority relies on diagnostic labels without concrete, character-particular actions. Final "sense of determination" feels rationalized, not compelled by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and holds, with closure as Conceptual Repricing via final linden leaf image reweighting her journey; cost legible in "releasing her grip on the familiar." However, no meaningful tightening or deepening; static observations lack beat progression. Orientation anchored early at trellis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mossy trellis and linden leaf constrain reflection and charge final image, meeting 9+ test; sensory details (raindrops, emerald moss) selective and POV-filtered. Weather subtly mirrors internal renewal. Minor cliché in "storm season raged on" but integrated purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restlessness to transform) signaled early but remains abstract, with no on-page reversal, agency, or tightening under Accumulative lens; no live option foreclosed. Pressure static, lacking cadence shift or felt price beyond declaration. "Growing sense of restlessness" never tests concretely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Theme of embracing change emerges from trellis/leaf images but undermined by direct statements like "transformation was not just a destination, but a continuous process," triggering thematic echo penalty. Final image offers non-literal resonance but overlaid with moralizing summaries. Lacks complexity; tidy platitudes replace earned insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single POV stable with plant-attuned perceptual signature; diction lyrical and consistent. Rhythm modulates slightly but repetition dulls under stress. No dialogue; free indirect clean but drifts to expository telling in realizations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervasive (e.g., "growth/renewal/evolve/metamorphosis/transform" in final third across ≥10 instances), with template cadence in repetitive stems like "As [she/Emilia] [realized/felt/knew]..."; artifacts dull closure image. Heavy overwriting in high-pressure realizations; −1.7 applied for final-third spread, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Familiar trope of nature-inspired epiphany lacks fresh angle; reflective nursery owner observing symbols feels templated without specific transformation. No bold risks; middle-ground universality without memorable particulars.</comment>
