<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Abstract phrasing like "withered heart they hoped to revive" and "teach withering to bloom again" delivers diagnostic labels over embodied contradictions; final renewal summarizes without micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building via origami alignment to curtain peak; CR closure in "heart, once withered and dry, now felt a sense of hope" reweights grief premise with legible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Observatory, workbench tools, and rippling curtains constrain crafting choices and charge final image; sensory details like "sandalwood and myrrh" selectively mirror internal renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Internal renewal stake signaled early escalates accumulatively through illumination deepening, but lacks protagonist agency narrowing options; cost felt in transmuted grief but abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief-to-bloom emerges organically from flower stencil and curtains without moralizing; resonant final image reconfigures prior motifs, capped by pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with poetic perceptual signature biased toward celestial craft; rhythmic modulation fits subdued tone, though minor repetition dulls peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Repetitive loops like "shimmered/glow/rippled" in curtain descriptions and template cadence ("As they worked, [element] [flowery action]") create paraphrase churn; density sags in overwrought abstractions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami-star mechanics and "curtains of intention" transforms mourning artisan trope into celestial renewal; risk in genuinely artificial conceit heightens ingenuity.</comment>
