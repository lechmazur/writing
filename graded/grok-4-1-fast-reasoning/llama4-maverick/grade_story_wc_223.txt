<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Crisis actor's cold smile and proposal reveal pragmatism, but traits like "benevolently ruthless" remain labels without contradictory impulses or embodied trade-offs in micro-choices; survivor mostly passive observer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via symbolic density to Charged Poise closure ("suspended in a moment of luminous absence"), with felt void cost; loose causality in historian's sudden emergence and instant alliance lacks tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Whispering gallery's acoustics amplify historian's words as prophecy and floor enables walking pattern, constraining gaze and action; chessboard mirrors internal void purposefully.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of walking words and nomadic penumbra transforms interregnum tropes; historian's emergence from shadows feels earned in symbolic frame.</comment>
