<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Solid interiority via dust motes ritual revealing contradictory secrecy/connection impulses; embodied bittersweet emotions peak in "joy and sorrow" contemplation. Micro-choices sparse, with endurance over decisive turn limiting peak pressure. Final peace earned via prior reflection anchors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pigeon tending to reflective deepening, landing Charged Poise closure in final dust motes gaze with bittersweet cost legible in "beauty and the pain." Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early. No causality breaks despite reflective mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dust motes under skylight recur as micro-setting constraining ritual choice and charging final image of swirling equilibrium. Sensory details (musty paper, cooing) filter through POV priorities, evolving with emotional tone. Attic sanctuary subtly guides balance-seeking without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secrecy vs. connection balance) signaled via paper trails/history; textural escalation deepens through dust ritual untangling thoughts, foreclosing disconnection with felt bittersweet cost. Mild pressure via internal endurance, no external reversal, but coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of fragile balance amid blurred past emerges organically from dust/paper trails/songs; final image reconfigures "delicate balance" non-literally with lingering ambiguity. Resonance from particulars avoids moralizing, though reflection-heavy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature biased to rituals (dust motes, pigeons); rhythmic modulation suits reflective calm. Cross-cap from Q7 line debt applied. No head-hopping; voice distinct via sensory idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Repetitive loops in "dust motes swirled," "paper trails," and attic scents create paraphrase churn across reflections, dulling momentum. Template cadence in sequential ritual descriptions; density suffers from redundancies, though closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pigeon trainer, dust mapping, mars chip in attic transforms reinvention trope via textural buildup to charged peace. Risky lyric reflection heightens emotional specificity without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
