<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; Elian's motivation remains abstract and untested, with success at chisel strike feeling unearned rather than compelled by internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via sensory buildup to chisel strike RR (Charged Poise in resonant release); orientation anchored by para 1; closure cost legible in lingering memory, but thin opposition limits tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (crystalline hum, aurora seep) mirrors synesthetic perception and charges chisel burst; cavern subtly guides song response without overt constraint on pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unfetter hush) signaled early but remains abstract without on-page reversal, opposition, or agency test; buildup lacks coherent pressure narrowing options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder emerges via particulars but weakens with final-para telling ("certifying wonder as essential," "testament to the power of art"); lacks non-literal resonant answer reweighting prior images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with synesthetic perceptual signature; lyrical diction modulates rhythmically, but elevated register occasionally drifts from embodied immediacy in peak song.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("unfetter the sculpted hush" thrice, repetitive "sense of" peace/wonder); overwriting in abstract summaries dulls chisel climax propulsion and density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, aurora, and "sculpted hush" transforms abstract mysticism into textured ritual; chisel crescendo turn feels earned from established pattern.</comment>
