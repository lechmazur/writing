<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Abstract interiority dominates with unearned epiphanies like "thawing heart" summary, lacking contradictory impulses or embodied conflict in the crafting scene; micro-choices align superficially but reveal no hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from crafting to orb completion; Charged Poise closure in holding orb aloft reconfigures thawing metaphor with felt cost of abandoning frozen shell, oriented clearly early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Selective sensory details like "damp earth and faint tang of decay" integrate purposefully; cracked panes' light constrains and charges final orb image, mirroring internal thaw without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of crafting safe zones signaled but remains abstract/internal with no on-page test or reversal narrowing options; minimal tightening in nearing completion lacks visceral price under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Thawing/renewal theme emerges organically from glass orb and melting ice images, resonating in final glow without overt moralizing; avoids binaries but counter-readings limited by declarative purpose statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with contemplative perceptual bias; rhythmic prose modulates effectively, though self-narration borders expository; no head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing loops ("thawing heart," "safe zones") and paraphrase redundancy across paragraphs create template cadence, dulling propulsion; overwriting with stacked metaphors in most sentences obscures density in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Glassblower in control room synthesizing thaw metaphors offers fresh angle on renewal; tropes transformed modestly but symbolic elements feel prompted rather than inevitable.</comment>
