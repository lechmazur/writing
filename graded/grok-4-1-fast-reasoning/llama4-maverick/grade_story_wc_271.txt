<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Diagnostic labels like "somatic markers" and therapy-speak ("anchor optimism in realism") replace embodied contradiction, flattening internal conflict to summary; drone strike backstory motivates but lacks micro-choices revealing flaws under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in pearl of stillness and photo smoothing; legible cost in emotional endurance of trauma reconfigures stance, one tightening at cliff edge sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Trees evolve from "withered fingers" to "gentle fingers," mirroring internal shift and charging final image; sensory details (wind, waves, salty air) selectively integrated, constraining path to cliff-edge solace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Internal stake of healing escalates accumulatively via environmental immersion, one deepening at cliff crystallizes stance; cost legible in tension release but lacks sharper trade-off narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of solace in desolation emerges organically from tree/sea/photo images reweighted at end; resonant final gaze offers non-literal answer without moralizing, though direct "anchor optimism" edges overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward nature; rhythmic prose modulates to calmer cadence at closure, but minor register drift into abstract diction ("nucleus of calm") dilutes immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "stillness"/"peace" (e.g., repeated "sense of peace settle over her") and "seemed to be" template cadence (5+ uses) dull propulsion in reflective beats; density drags mid-story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone-trauma healing via windswept arboretum transforms nature-solace trope; photo's metaphorical smoothing adds ingenuity, though arc risks generic epiphany familiarity.</comment>
