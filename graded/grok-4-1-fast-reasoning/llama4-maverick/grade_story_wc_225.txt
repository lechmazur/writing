<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in guilt over student's loss drives decoding, but interior conflict remains summary ("haunted him, a constant reminder") without embodied contradictory impulses acting in the decoding scene; tidy forgiveness at emergence lacks visible cost on pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from tapestry decoding to labyrinth emergence as RR (Charged Poise in rebirth image); one tightening via revealed map narrows to confrontation; orientation anchored early, cost felt in guilt-lifting shore image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hush (wet earth, ozone) and stillness constrain solitary decoding choice; recurring threads and labyrinth portal charge final emergence image; POV-filtered details evolve purposefully without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) signaled early tightens accumulatively through decoding urgency to labyrinth entry; agency in unraveling forecloses deception path with felt guilt cost legible at "weight...lifting like ebbing tide."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Forgiveness theme emerges organically from threads/labyrinth particulars shifting to redemption; final "threads of time weaving back" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting past failure without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in thread/intensity focus; lyrical voice modulates from urgency ("fingers...urgency") to repose; purposeful repetition of hush/repose taught early enhances texture without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in hush/repose motifs and synonym churn ("sense of peace settle...weight lifting") dull decoding momentum; purposeful rhythm varies but overwriting metaphors in emergence beat reduce density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess tutor decoding literal soul-maze transforms redemption trope; platinum labyrinth irreplaceably ties threads to time-weave premise without hedging.</comment>
