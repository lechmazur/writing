<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strength in Lyra's embodied reluctance during ritual ("shiver run down her spine," "exhilarating and terrifying") and steady core amid merge; motivation clear but lacks micro-choices under pressure showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Aria applies secondary pressure effectively. Final endurance earned by prior gift and decision to help.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid Accumulative/Causal lens holds: Aria's arrival because fortune/spices leads to ritual therefore transformation; one tightening in essence shaping narrows to merge. Closure as RR (Charged Poise in expansion with "terrifying" cost legible in final image). Orientation anchored early; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orchard and moonlight constrain ritual (beasts gather, silvery glow builds apparition); spices as recurring object draw Aria and carry whispers, charging climax. Sensory hierarchy fits Lyra's priorities (scents alien/familiar). Details evolve causally without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Aria's bond, Lyra's metamorphosis) signaled early via fortune; ritual chant deepens pressure under hybrid lens, forcing merge with agency in conjuring. Cost visible in "blurring into kaleidoscope" and "terrifying" intimacy at peak. One tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of transformation as expansion emerges organically from ritual merge and steady anchor; final image ("bathed in the moonlight, ... sense of wonder") reweights fortune's "change" non-literally without moralizing. Subtext in cosmic bond transcends death via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person on Lyra; perceptual signature mystical/selective (beast thoughts as own). Lyrical rhythm modulates to intensity in ritual ("voices blending ... cosmic harmony"). No dialogue; voice coherent, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., spices integrate sensory/causal); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor loops in "felt" sensations (-0.3) and "paradoxically steady" motif paraphrase, but not obscuring closure. No filter stacks or artifacts in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune cookie in fairy orchard sparks ritual; beasts' harmony and merge transform tropes organically. Risk in cookie's anachronism heightens cosmic intimacy without gimmick. Final reconfiguration inevitable from particulars.</comment>
