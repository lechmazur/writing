<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure; Lyra remains static observer with told motivation lacking embodied conflict or earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred but no density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift yields closure; lacks DC/RR/CR with legible cost, as repetitive motifs fail to reconfigure stakes on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vivid "eternal, eerie twilight" and silt-buried anchor provide selective detail, but benthic stars create unresolved inconsistency; setting doesn't constrain choices or charge final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>No dominant stake or tightening under Accumulative lens; abstract "great adventure" lacks on-page pressure, agency, or cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Expansion theme emerges from motifs but via overt repetition like "unfolded horizons" rather than earned images; tidy final "beacon of hope" moralizes without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward wonder, but repetitive diction erodes texture; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops (e.g., "benthic city, once a place of darkness" variants across paragraphs) and template cadence in reflections create redundancy; artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Benthic post-alien premise offers fresh angle on exploration tropes, but generic execution via repetitive symbolism lacks bold transformation.</comment>
