<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Interiority leans on abstract summaries like "questioning the convictions that had driven her" rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene; diagnostic phrasing such as "balanced self-respect and compassion" feels unearned mid-reflection. Micro-choices like grasping the tail reveal mild connection but lack visible cost or hierarchy of values. Change in purpose emerges but without embodied struggle or prior causality building to it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via layered reflections on shedding; orientation anchors early in workshop under stars post-con. Closure as Conceptual Repricing in final smile and river image reweights convictions with conceptual cost of dogma shed. Lacks one tightening reversal, but single deepening via chameleon pang suffices for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory details like "night air clung... damp veil" and "scent of damp earth" selectively mirror internal flux; mist and stars evolve, charging images without overt symbolism. Workshop/chameleon constrain gentle handling choices subtly. No object charges final image enough for 9+, but purposeful integration fits scope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconstructing purpose post-con signaled early, deepens accumulatively via chameleon connection narrowing dogmatic options. Pressure coherent but abstract, no live trade-off or felt price beyond vague pang; agency in tending lacks opposition test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of fragile convictions emerges organically from chameleon/shedding particulars, final river image offers non-literal resonance reweighting balance without moral. Repetitive assertions like "balance self-respect and compassion" border on direct statement, diluting subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward vivid stillness; rhythmic texture in syntax suits lyric mode, but occasional register drift to abstract philosophizing. No dialogue; elision of con backstory taught implicitly without friction payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "shedding layers," "reconstructing... purpose/understanding" across paragraphs) and template cadence ("As she worked," "Lena's thoughts turned") dull propulsion, pervading final third including closure river image. Synonym churn in mist/shimmering descriptors creates artifact muddle; density low despite overwrought metaphors every line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Chameleon-change metaphor transforms introspection trope mildly via tail grasp, but post-con wildlife handler reflection feels template-derived without bold synthesis or fresh angle. Final river reconfiguration grows from particulars but risks generic epiphany.</comment>
