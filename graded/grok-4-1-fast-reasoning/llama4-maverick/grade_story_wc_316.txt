<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract summaries like "emotional numbness" and "identity crisis" without embodied micro-choices under pressure; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. Final change feels told via epiphany ("sense of clarity and purpose") rather than earned through specific struggle. Diagnostic phrasing dominates pivotal meditation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup in meditation warping reality, leading to RR closure (peace transcending crisis) with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchored early (Kaito in dojo post-ego death). Lacks tightening beat; static reflection flattens causality before final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Floating dojo's hum, vibration, and isolation selectively mirror internal tension, constraining focus amid history flux. Brain jar as micro-setting charges identity motif without overt symbolism. Sensory hierarchy fits introspective urgency; no pivotal flaws touch closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeat numbness) signaled early with accumulative deepening via opposites reconciliation, narrowing to Charged Poise at end. Agency via meditative endurance, but pressure remains abstract without on-page reversal testing commitment. Cost felt in turmoil but lacks visible trade-off in climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of self beyond duplicate emerges organically from brain image and opposites embrace, reweighting identity in final step-out image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes. Minor direct statements like "vivify his true self" dilute subtext slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with consistent introspective perceptual signature; diction modulates philosophically but coherently. No head-hopping or elision issues. Voice converges to generic reflection under stress, lacking rhythmic distinction in peak reconciliation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("sense of" x8, "reminder" repeats, journey summaries churn synonyms like turmoil/struggle/crisis). Template cadence in meditation beats ("Kaito felt," "seemed to"); artifacts dull closure image and pervade final third, disallowing high bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sci-fi synthesis of clones, floating dojo, history flux transforms spiritual journey trope via identity stakes. Brain reprise offers fresh inflection on custody battle. Premise commits to implications without retreat, but risks middle-ground introspection.</comment>
