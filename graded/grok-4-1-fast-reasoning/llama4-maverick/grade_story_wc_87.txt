<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Consistent motivation to realign drives paddling choice with embodied calm, but repetitive diagnostic labels like "backlash of regrets" weaken contradictory impulses in pivotal reflection beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with early orientation at launch; resonant reconfiguration in sunset resolve clutching compass delivers legible cost of endured regrets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Utility poles recur to constrain navigation and charge final symbol of resilience; sensory paddle rhythm and golden sunset selectively mirror internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of realignment tightens accumulatively through rhythmic paddling deepening turmoil to peace; cost legible in persisted regrets shaping resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically from poles/compass progression; final image reconfigures regrets non-literally without overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with melancholic perceptual bias; rhythmic syntax modulates effectively during paddling but drifts repetitive in reflections.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "regrets," "align," and "utility poles" across final third create synonym churn dulling closure; template cadence in repetitive stems hampers propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Utility poles as navigation aid transforms divorce-recovery trope into fresh, grounded synthesis; risk in symbolic reuse heightens stakes organically.</comment>
