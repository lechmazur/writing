<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Conjurer's motivation told abstractly as "mathematics of emotion" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; "spark of understanding" epiphany feels unearned and diagnostic rather than dramatized through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure via ritual realization reweighting emotion as "fluid landscape"; orientation anchored early in cavern orchard; cost legible in "weight of ambiguous loss" shifting to optimism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration of cavern orchard, fungi glow, and stalactite drips mirrors internal states and charges final image; mosaic stone and glass eyes constrain ritual choices purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quantify emotion) signaled but escalates minimally via ritual cadence shift under accumulative lens; internal pressure from ambiguous loss tightens once but lacks agency-driven trade-off or narrowing options with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of emotion's fluidity emerges organically from ritual but borders pseudo-profundity in repeated "mathematics of emotion"; resonant final image of buried optimism reweights loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward inventive mysticism; rhythmic prose modulates effectively, though occasional elevated diction drifts from conjurer's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in descriptions ("silent orchard," "glass eyes gleam" repeated without progression) and template cadence ("As she..." openings) dull momentum; overwriting in ritual peak with mixed metaphors obscures propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxidermy eyes scrying emotion math in cavern orchard transforms mystical tropes; risk in abstract conceptual frame pays off in CR without gimmickry.</comment>
