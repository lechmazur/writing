<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent via obsessive work, but interiority relies on abstract labels like "intensity that bordered on obsession" without embodied contradiction or simultaneous impulses acting in pivotal integration moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to Charged Poise closure ("sense of clarity wash over them"); cost legible in vanished stars and urgency, though closure phrasing told rather than imaged; orientation anchored early, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vanishing stars as recurring environmental constraint tightens timeframe choices and charges final darkness image; sensory details (musty scent, whirring press) selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock emotion's math) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via star-by-star vanishing that narrows time options with felt urgency into closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of transposed empathy emerges organically through print's ambiguity and final realization reweighting premise without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in "darkness...filled with possibility."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct poetic texture (shimmering text, writhing emotions); perceptual bias toward otherworldly patterns consistent under rising intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Overwriting in peak beat with stacked metaphors ("swirling vortex of meaning, a kaleidoscope of emotions") dulls propulsion; minor repetitive stems ("eyes gleamed," "fingers...") create template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress mysticism and emotion's math transforms tropes organically; risk in abstract-concept premise pays off in charged, inevitable closure image.</comment>
