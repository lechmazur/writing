<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Motivation to defy conformity drives untangling but lacks concrete interior contradictions acting simultaneously during pivotal unraveling; chaste courtesan trait remains label-only without complicating choices or embodied stress; epiphanic change feels abstractly told rather than earned through micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from threads/echoes to prism glow as Charged Poise RR; orientation anchored early in courtyard; closure cost legible in "bittersweet" harvest and "exhilarating and terrifying" surge reconfiguring her reality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Recurring snowfall motif evolves from heavy silence to crunching melody, mirroring internal shift and charging final image of departure; sensory selectivity (flakes dancing, prism glinting) filters through her poetic bias without clichés overwhelming pivotal glow moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-liberation tightens texturally via echoes' release deepening to prism pulse; agency in untangling forecloses conformity path with bittersweet cost; pressure coheres accumulatively without reversal but culminates in stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of defiant self-discovery emerges from threads-to-prism progression without overt statement; final image of walking away with prism as beacon offers resonant reconfiguration of conformity's hold; minor platitude slip in "beauty of being true to oneself" but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with poetic perceptual signature ("bodily poetic form," starlight facets); rhythmic modulation builds to closure without leakage; purposeful compression suits accumulative lens, perceptual bias consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Heavy metaphorical overwriting pervades climax ("cascade of echoes," "seismic shift") with low density and paraphrase loops on freeing/lighter motifs dulling propulsion; template cadence in sequential "as she [action]" beats; artifacts obscure untangling's cause/effect clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Oxymoronic chaste courtesan and "harvest of echoes" transform self-discovery allegory into fresh symbolic synthesis; prism unlocking via threads feels inevitable from early pull; risks bold lyricism without obscuring closure.</comment>
