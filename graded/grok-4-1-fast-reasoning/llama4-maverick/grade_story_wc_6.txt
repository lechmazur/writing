<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear but told via summaries like "surge of determination to prove that scars can sing"; lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene, reducing character depth under single-POV scrutiny.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with reflective buildup to Charged Poise closure in final lagoon vigil; orientation anchored early at shore, but minimal tightening beyond grafting beat weakens drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "sweet scent of wet earth and new life" integrate with action; recurring lagoon and sand pouch ground POV bias effectively without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>No coherent pressure or on-page reversal under Accumulative lens; abstract "scars" stake lacks escalation, narrowing of options, or visible cost in pivotal grafting moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Healing-through-scars theme emerges from tree graft and reflections but undermined by overt statements like old wise woman's words and repeated "scars can sing"; lacks resonant subtext ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with nature-infused perceptual signature; rhythmic modulation suits lyric tone, though occasional filter verbs like "felt" slightly dull immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in repetitive "felt a sense of" phrasing across final third and template stems like "As [time element]... Aria [felt/knew]" create scaffold drag, obscuring propulsion in closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Familiar reflective healing arc with nature symbols lacks fresh synthesis; coin and sand motifs feel ornamental rather than transformative.</comment>
