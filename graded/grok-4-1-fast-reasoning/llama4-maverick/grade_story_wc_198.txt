<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Limited interiority and no contradictory impulses shown on-page; saxophonist's motivation clear but lacks embodied conflict or micro-choices under pressure, reading archetypal rather than particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build via mist response and music permeation; Charged Poise closure as prophecy hushed in final stillness with felt cost of lingering hush, oriented clearly early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration (mist tendrils curling like fingers, prism refraction amplifying sound) mirrors internal states and charges final image; recurring mist/prism constrain atmospheric pressure without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early with textural escalation via insistent whispering and mist clearing/returning cadence shift narrowing to earned peace; cost legible in "vested hush that has settled."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of music's power over fear emerges organically from music-mist interplay; final radiant grotto image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting prophecy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stable POV with lyrical perceptual signature (music weaving like breeze); rhythmic modulation fits intensity, though some repetition borders opacity; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops ("mist begins to," "haunting" variants across para 8-12) and template cadence in descriptive runs dull propulsion; overwriting with metaphors in every high-density beat obscures closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lyrical fantasy musician countering prophecy transforms tropes via mist-music texture; risk-taking in accumulative poetic structure heightens eerie resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
