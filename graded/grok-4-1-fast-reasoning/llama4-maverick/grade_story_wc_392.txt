<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Diagnostic labels like "fortified vulnerability" and "watchfully calm" dominate interiority, flattening embodied emotion and contradictory impulses into therapy-speak during the reflective walk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to Conceptual Repricing closure—Maya emerges changed, past grip released—at the rain-washed exit; inscription moment deepens stake with felt cost of vulnerability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lantern as micro-setting constrains perception and charges final image, clutched dimmed as freedom symbol; sensory details (damp decay, dripping) integrate purposefully, mirroring internal untangling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth for victim/self) escalates texturally via memory density to realization, narrowing past's control; agency in persistent walk-through yields visible cost of exposed vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of renewal emerges organically from inscription "Free at last," lantern history, and tunnel-to-rain arc; final image reconfigures entrapment premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual bias toward residual emotions; lyrical rhythm modulates from shadowed flicker to brighter shine, consistent under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "memories" (entangled/surfacing/untangling) and template stems ("Maya felt a sense") across final third dull closure image; repetitive "reverberate" (3x) creates patterned artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Underground railroad lantern ties historical freedom to personal epiphany ingeniously; transforms haunted-tunnel trope through empirical investigator's psychic sensitivity.</comment>
