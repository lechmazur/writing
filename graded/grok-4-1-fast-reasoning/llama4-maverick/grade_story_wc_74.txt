<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority concrete but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; "heart swelled with a sense of hope" feels unearned epiphany without embodied cost or flaws complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from reflection to creation; charged poise closure in dawn image reconfigures urban despair vs. hope with felt cost of smog's return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse and smog constrain solace, charging final contrast of pulsing languages against seeping pollution; selective sensory details (moon glow, rustling leaves) integrated purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reviving languages signaled but remains abstract without on-page reversal or trade-off; daydream-to-painting tightening lacks narrowing of live options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of kindness transcending noise emerges from brush/painting images but weakens with near-explicit "strangers who remembered kindness" in penultimate paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with poetic perceptual signature biased toward beauty; rhythmic modulation supports accumulative texture without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "city's smog/din/noise/pollution" and repetitive "saffron quiet" create synonym churn dulling propulsion; overwrites creation beat with stacked descriptors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of painting lost languages with moon-tipped brush transforms urban despair trope; sentimental hope feels familiar despite organic buildup.</comment>
