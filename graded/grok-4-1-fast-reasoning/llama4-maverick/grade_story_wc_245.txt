<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Unique traits like skin-absorbing languages and blind navigation compel sensory-driven choices effectively; tattoos shifting with plant language reveals character under pressure. Internal conflict subdued, with emotions more declarative than contradictory impulses in pivotal approach to stillpoint. Earned realization at convergence ties to prior motivation without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from faint notes to converging energies, reweighting emotional stake at stillpoint CR with felt cost of internalized secrets. Orientation anchored early in forest and night sky. Continuous journey with one tightening (notes growing louder) suffices; closure image of pulsing ring and shimmering tattoos makes before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details (ultrasonic trees, skin-tingling languages, blooming scents) selectively filter through blind POV, constraining path via sound and touch. Compass ring as micro-setting charges final pulse at stillpoint. Atmosphere evolves causally with nearing convergence, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emotional navigation via stillpoint) signaled early, tightens via accumulating sensory pressure (air thickens, single piercing note) under Accumulative lens, forcing reverent pause and heart-sync. Cost felt in soul-illumination and carrying secrets forward. One deepening at convergence narrows to introspection; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden harmonies emerges organically from sensory absorption and stillpoint realization, reweighting self-understanding without statement. Final image of footsteps echoing musical trail offers non-literal resonance to heart's labyrinth. Complexity lingers in ongoing journey post-insight, avoiding tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature: blind attunement to sound/scent/skin biases noticing (e.g., "tattoos shifting to reflect the language of the plants"). Lyrical rhythm modulates with intensity, compressing at "piercing note." No dialogue; voice texture consistent and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("quiet blaze" x3, "mapmaker's [body part]" stems) creates template cadence in mid-section, dulling propulsion without pattern payoff. Sensory density high but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., multiple "heart" reactions). Closure prose clean; rhythm varies overall, read-aloud ear holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fantasy synthesis (skin languages, ultrasonic whispers, tattoo cartography) transforms navigation trope into emotional dowse, feeling inevitable via sensory buildup. Risky lyric journey heightens introspection stakes organically. No close template echoes; fresh premise commits fully.</comment>
