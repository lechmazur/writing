<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Solid baseline motivation from confusion to exploration, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; family memory anchors reflection without deep micro-choices under pressure; final step feels smooth rather than earned through embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from observation to sketching to alignment; Charged Poise closure legible in final step with felt cost of disconnection; orientation anchored immediately, one tightening via compass-light sync suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Deck details (compass applique, railing, void) selectively constrain and guide final image; sensory echo and visual stars mirror internal shift; coherent choreography in solo wandering; recurring compass charges ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confusion to exploration) signaled early with accumulative deepening via memory-sketching; light glimpse tightens options toward journey; cost of temporal stretch felt but pressure remains internal/low-opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of stillness-to-movement emerges organically via deck relic to guided step; final image reconfigures disconnection into promise without moralizing; compass reprise shifts meaning non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual bias toward wonder/decay; voice texture consistent in poetic rhythm; no dialogue; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("stars twinkling like diamonds" x2, wonder repetitions) and synonym churn on silence/light dull density in final third; minor template cadence in descriptions; propulsion solid but artifacts cap high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time dilation solitude with compass guidance transforms isolation trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens emotional specificity; non-obvious alignment payoff feels earned.</comment>
