<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete in cloth-handling moment but devolves into label-speak like "confidently uncertain" without embodied contradiction; final resolve feels summarized rather than earned through simultaneous impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with memory density building to Charged Poise RR at "spark of determination ignite within him"; orientation anchored early, but minimal tightening—phone call adds little causal change before closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Quarry trailer vividly anchors with dust smell, golden light, and stone walls echoing memories; recurring valley view charges final image without constraining choices strongly enough for 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restlessness vs. quiet life) signaled early with accumulative deepening via memories; mild escalation in phone distraction, but no on-page reversal or trade-off foreclosing live options before resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of purpose amid loss emerges from cloth and quarry images, resonating in final starry walkout; weakened by platitude repetition like "in the quiet moments that we find our true voice."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in appraiser/roadie lens on objects; minimal dialogue natural and professional, but some filter-verb stacks dull immediacy in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound ("echo valley longing" x4, repeated doubt/resolve summaries); template cadence in ending ("As the [time] [verb], Jack [felt]") dulls closure image; heavy redundancy kills density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Ex-roadie appraiser premise offers fresh angle on thrill-vs-quiet trope; arc remains standard internal pivot without bold risks transforming stakes.</comment>
