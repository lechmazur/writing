<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses act in scene; interiority relies on abstract labels like "jaded wonder" without embodied micro-choices; unearned epiphany at box find flattens motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred; orientation anchors early, but no closure with cost—ending image of "weight slowly beginning to lift" lacks legible before/after reconfiguration or price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bioluminescent glow and mist selectively constrain path (reveals hidden way) and charge final image; sensory hierarchy fits introspective POV, though some generic phrasing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Stake to kindle empathy signaled but static—no on-page tightening, reversal, or agency test; abstract internal pressure never materializes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Empathy-in-darkness theme emerges via images but overt statements ("guiding principle, a reminder...") replace implication; final image offers partial resonance without reweighting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with consistent perceptual bias toward wonder; diction purposeful but drifts abstract in reflections, lacking rhythmic peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in epiphanies ("felt an inexplicable connection... felt the weight... felt a sense"); template "As she [action], she felt" cadence across walks dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Time-traveler baseball adds quirky synthesis to empathy quest, transforming tropes organically; lacks bold risk to elevate beyond solid.</comment>
