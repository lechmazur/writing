<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lena's traits are consistent and shown through actions like humming the mundane, but lack contradictory impulses or genuine flaws complicating choices; idealized serenity feels archetypal without embodied stress in peak goodbye moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from sensory hum to Emma's passing as Charged Poise RR; orientation anchored early ("radiant haven above the clouds"); closure cost legible in "Emma's eyes drifted closed, a soft smile on her lips."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration like "scent of blooming flowers" and vinyl shard constrain emotional choices and charge final image; haven pressures peaceful tactics without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flawless goodbye) signaled post-blood work with textural tightening via music syncing breath; cost felt in Emma's slowing breath and Lena's lingering vigil, but low external pressure limits agency tests.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of music transcending farewell emerges organically from vinyl reprise and scent shifts; resonant non-literal close in "scent of hope still lingered" reweights particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias toward sounds/scents; lyrical diction modulates rhythmically to match "slow, mournful waltz," no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Recurring "soft" stems and "scent of hope" loops (4x) create paraphrase churn dulling density in final third; purposeful lyric rhythm holds but figurative stacking ("pulsing stillness," "heady mix") borders muddle in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hospice music therapy in cloud haven with vinyl/sensory motifs transforms death trope; "hymning the mundane" turn feels earned from particulars.</comment>
