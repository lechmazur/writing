<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; interiority relies on label-only traits like "gently thorough" without embodied pressure or micro-choices; static motivation lacks visible cost in pivotal documentation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with CR closure via final legacy image reweighting preservation, but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift; cost illegible beyond early "pang of melancholy" uncharged at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "sweet scent of blooming flowers and the soft lapping of waves" anchor and mirror nostalgia effectively; jetty subtly guides reflective choices without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>No dominant stake escalation under Accumulative lens; static reflection lacks reversal, narrowing, or deepening to force trade-off; abstract preservation untested on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme of enduring preservation emerges but through overt telling like repeated "testament to the power"; simplistic resolution lacks ambiguity or counter-reading in final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with consistent lyrical perceptual signature; diction purposeful but lacks rhythmic modulation for nonexistent pressure peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops (e.g., "preserved," "legacy," "testament," "continued to" across final third) create template cadence and dull closure image; synonym churn obscures propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quirky elements like "walnut-ink archivist" and "regenerated covenant" inflects vignette; transforms static reflection without close template echoes.</comment>
