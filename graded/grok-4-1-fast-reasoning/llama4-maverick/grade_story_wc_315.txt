<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interiority relies on diagnostic labels like "watcher's burden" without embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene; micro-choices in revising feel competent but lack visible struggle or cost until vague endurance claim.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with steady density build from revisions to dawn Charged Poise RR; closure reconfiguration legible in "captured their essence... change their mission forever" with burden's cost felt as "settling more firmly."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Arbor's lattice and cloud isolation vividly filter through Lyra's priorities, constraining solitude; starlight and dawn evolution charge final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of precise charting signaled early but lacks any reversal, deepening, or cadence shift under Accumulative lens; pressure remains static, with tiredness as only mild felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of burden vs. curiosity emerges implicitly from revision arc and buckle motif; final clouds image offers resonant non-literal reconfiguration of resolve, capped by Q4 pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with pattern-biased perceptual signature; rhythmic modulation fits inventive mind, capped by Q7 artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "revising," "reminder," and "burden" across mid-section dull propulsion; repetitive stems like "As [she/time]..." create template cadence without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cloud-jumper arbor and celestial mapping transforms vigilance trope; risk in poetic vignette structure heightens isolation stakes coherently.</comment>
