<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and consistent but lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; no internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene, only declarative traits like "charming rogue scholar."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-building in garden, orientation anchored early; closure as CR via seed dispersing reconfigures defiance but lacks one meaningful tightening or cost-legible image, e.g., "seeds dispersing" feels triumphant without undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like "thick with the scent... gentle hum" integrate purposefully, filtering through Lyra's cryptic goals; greenhouse constrains planting and masks code, charging final legacy image without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of defiance signaled but static, no on-page reversal, deepening, or agency foreclosing a path; pressure fails to escalate under Accumulative lens, remaining abstract without materialized test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of coded defiance emerges implicitly from planting patterns and seed dispersal; resonant but undermined by repetitive assertions like repeated "spark of defiance," diluting subtext without complex ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature on insects masking code; rhythmic texture modulates but some register elevation clashes in summary stretches; no dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound, e.g., multiple "art of subtle communication" and "message patterns" restatements across paragraphs; template cadence in repetitive sentence stems dulls propulsion, artifacts pervade final third including closure reprise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh dystopian synthesis of taxable thoughts and garden codes transforms surveillance trope organically; risk in cryptic planting pays off in seed's conceptual spread without gimmickry.</comment>
