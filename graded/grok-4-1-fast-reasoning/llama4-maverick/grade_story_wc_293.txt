<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Character lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; interiority defaults to generic epiphanies like "luminous disbelief wash over them" without embodied conflict or micro-choices under pressure, flattening motivation to passive reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern of lifting fog/secrets building to CR closure (pain as catalyst, fiddler vanishing into legacy), but vignette-like structure lacks motivated tightening beyond convenient discoveries; cost legible in transformed memory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Scaffold wrap and glass flake constrain choices (deciphering, clutching) and charge final image (flake glows); fog/mist mirrors internal lift purposefully without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secrets/redemption) signaled early via amnesty, deepens accumulatively to music/urge, but passive discoveries dilute agency; one tightening via breeze/message narrows to play/recount with felt cost in lingering pain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges but devolves into repetitive moralizing ("sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'" echoed thrice in final paragraphs), triggering thematic echo penalty and replacing resonant CR with direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with consistent poetic perceptual signature (observant gazes, musical flow), but overwrought diction risks opacity; no dialogue or head-hopping issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade final third ("testament... legend... reminder... live on"; "weight... lift" echoes), with template cadence in repetitive endings dulling closure image; heavy artifacts (−1.7) flatten propulsion despite vivid sensory bursts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Assembled elements (fiddler, flake, amnesty) feel checklist-driven rather than organic synthesis; mystical redemption trope lacks fresh inflection beyond "pixelated amnesty."</comment>
