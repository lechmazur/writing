<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in claustrophobia and father's plan intensifies via absorption choice, but interiority abstracts emotions ("excitement and dread") without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; "flavors...sprout" borders unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with hush descent building density to RR closure (doll rests, essence remains) with felt cost in partial overcoming; oriented early via Eli, trellis, inversion hour.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory progression ("soft golden light seeped...atmosphere thicken") mirrors internal expansion; trellis constrains as open refuge charging "gateway to vast inner landscape."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcome claustrophobia) signaled early, deepens via silence absorption narrowing fear; one tightening sufficient, cost legible in "not vanished, but no longer dominant."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of growth via unexpected solace emerges organically from particulars; final doll image offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting "contracted world" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in silence "flavors"; lyrical diction ("intangibly tangible") consistent and voice-motivated, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short sentences in inversion build propulsion), high density; minor synonym churn on "silences" and paraphrase in closing reflections deducts without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of inverted gravity and silence flavors transforms refuge trope; "gilded hush" premise commits fully, inevitable in "sprout within" growth image.</comment>
