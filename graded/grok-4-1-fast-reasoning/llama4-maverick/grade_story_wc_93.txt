<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear but procedural without contradictory impulses or embodied stress; rock placement lacks micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values under curse pressure. Interiority tells reverence via stock phrasing like "sense of reverence and wonder" rather than particular contradiction. Earned change feels declarative, not pressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dust find to rock sequence vibrating into vision CR, reweighting prophecies with felt completion cost in "weight of unfulfilled prophecies had been lifted." Single scene oriented early (bluff, aurora, shore); one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory selection vivid and purposeful (salt/ozone, churning sea, aurora glow narrowing to rock energy shimmer); tidal bluff constrains placement at edge, charging final image of scattered rocks as testament. POV bias filters via curse-tingle response to dust. Environment mirrors internal patterns without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harness dust for patterns) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via sequence buildup to shimmer/vision tightening knowledge; agency in deliberate placements forecloses unfulfilled path with curse-lift cost. Pressure coherent but abstract, lacking visceral trade-off in pivotal rock completion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic patterns revealed emerges organically via rock geometry mirroring stars into vision, final image of vanishing herder reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in curse-stir to peace invites reflection on revelation's cusp. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in precognitive sensing (curse tingle, pattern meditation); rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate slowness to vibrating energy. Diction controlled, mystical texture biased to celestial harmonies.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive stems ("The herder's ... stirred," "sacred patterns") and paraphrase loops (multiple awe/trepidation scans) create template cadence across rock beats, dulling density; figurative density high but coherent without muddle. Propulsion varies but scaffold drags mid-sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eel herder with stardust math-ritual transforms cosmic tropes via frictionless prophecy hook; risk in abstract physics-cusp payoff feels organic to pattern drive. Irreplaceable premise angle on revelation through rocks.</comment>
