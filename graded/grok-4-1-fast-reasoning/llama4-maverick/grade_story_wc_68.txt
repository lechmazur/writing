<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Interiority relies on repetitive trait labels like "rationally rebellious" and "fierce determination" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; final smile feels unearned as no prior impulses act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with reflective density on cog and ruins building to Charged Poise closure (wry smile reconfiguring purpose with isolation cost in final lines); lacks one meaningful tightening as beats redundantly circle without cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sewer stench, damp clinking cog, and watery ruins provide vivid sensory anchors integrated into reflection; cog as micro-setting charges final image but doesn't constrain choices beyond handling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling narratives, preserving past) signaled early but remains abstract with no on-page reversal, deepening, or trade-off under Accumulative lens; smile offers minimal reweighting without felt price escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of humanity's folly via competing narratives emerges implicitly from cog/ruins reflections; final wry smile provides non-literal resonance but repetition dilutes subtext into echo rather than earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with philosophical perceptual signature in noticing cog/history; voice modulates slightly but repetitive syntax ("Kael's [trait]") erodes distinct texture under sustained reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound (e.g., "competing narratives" and "sunken city ruins" churn across 5+ instances); template cadence in repetitive stems like "Kael's [mind/action]" dulls propulsion, with artifacts touching closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Post-plague sewer philosopher with cog offers fresh hermit angle on ruins-seeking; trope transformation limited by static reflection loops lacking bold risk in structure or turns.</comment>
