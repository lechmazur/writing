<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Motivation to outwit tricksters is clear and consistent but lacks internal contradiction or embodied conflict; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, with success feeling unearned. Interiority relies on labels like "cautiously hopeful" without particular degradation under stress. Final pride lacks visible cost tied to prior micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with tuning leading to pattern to counter-signal causing dwindled occurrences (DC closure), oriented early in radio station. One tightening via emerging pattern suffices, but resolution reports are off-page and cost low ("thrill of satisfaction" without legible price in final vigilance). No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Radio station and charts anchor selectively with sensory hum, static, console glow constraining tuning action. Atmosphere electric but generic; colleagues' faces lit by glow underuses for pressure. No object charges closure image beyond recap.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode/outwit signaled early tightens once via pattern to counter-signal under causal lens, with agency in sending. Pressure coheres but lacks visible cost narrowing options; success immediate without trade-off in peak beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of ingenuity vs cosmic disruption emerges implicitly via signals/charts but drifts to overt statements like "outwitting the cosmic tricksters and restoring balance." Final image of vigilance offers no resonant non-literal answer, leaning platitude. Recurring labels prevent complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with consistent perceptual focus on signals/charts, but generic diction lacks distinct texture or bias. No dialogue to judge. Voice modulates minimally with excitement but converges on repetitive hopeful phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "cautiously hopeful," "cosmic tricksters," "outwit/restore balance" across paragraphs) and template cadence ("As [she/action], [emotion]") dull propulsion, obscuring closure image. Redundancies like multiple vigilance/pride restatements fail cut test. Density low with generic modifiers over specifics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Premise of signal interpreter vs cosmic tricksters follows generic sci-fi template without fresh angle via specific detail or moral calculus; tropes like celestial messages untransformed. No bold risks heighten stakes.</comment>
