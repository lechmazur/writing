<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Label-only traits like "gloomy cheerfulness" repeated without contradictory impulses acting in scene; no micro-choices reveal value hierarchy under pressure, e.g., pressing on amid "terrifying" cacophony lacks embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to CR closure ("compass click into place"); orientation anchored early; cost legible in "beautiful and terrifying" cacophony, but no tightening forecloses live option.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Observatory details (crumbling domes, rusting telescopes, echoing halls) constrain mystical immersion and charge final image of infused purpose; sensory hierarchy sharpens urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stake (decode riddle) signaled early with accumulative escalation via hums/whispers crescendo; agency in cello/shell use, but abstract stakes lack visceral trade-off at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of discovery in forsaken places emerges from particulars like shell/cello summoning ghosts; final sea-gaze reweights premise obliquely, but edges platitudes like "promise of discovery".</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias to mysteries; rhythmic texture modulates, but elevated diction drifts in peaks without full compression under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops ("whispers of the past" x4, "resonant hums" x3, "gloomy cheerfulness" x3) and repetitive "felt/she [action]" stems dull propulsion across build; overwrites peak with stacked metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shell/cello in observatory summons compass organically; surreal build transforms mysticism trope without gimmickry.</comment>
