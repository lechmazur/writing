<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Interiority defaults to abstract labels like "deep sense of peace" and "surge of determination" without contradictory impulses acting in the breathing scene; Aria's change feels epiphanic rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to conceptual repricing closure ("memory ... no longer a source of pain"); orientation anchored early, one tightening via breathing suffices, pilgrim motivates without breaking mysticism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration peaks in blossoms "unfurl like tiny stars" mirroring internal connection, charging final image; viaduct as threshold constrains mystical choices without static postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stake of unused love tightens accumulatively through pilgrim's guidance to breathing conduit moment, foreclosing skepticism with felt emotional cost; agency in exercises narrows to internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Internal love theme emerges via Tear and blossoms reprise, resonating in final compassion flow; pilgrim's "love you seek is within" line borders overt statement, softening implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in ethereal sensory diction ("wisteria that seemed to glow"); rhythmic modulation sustains foggy lucidity without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Poetic rhythm varies purposefully, but "felt a deep sense" paraphrase loop across emotional beats dulls density slightly; no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Pilgrim of sparks" with ember eyes and camera obscura's hidden patterns synthesize fresh mystical lens on self-healing, transforming spiritual tropes organically.</comment>
