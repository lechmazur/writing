<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to smooth memories is consistent and drives progression to pavilion absorption, but internal conflict remains mostly summarized rather than shown through contradictory impulses in key beats like the sand touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with memory density building to Charged Poise closure at coral touch ("memories...flood...threatened to overwhelm her"), legible cost in overwhelm threat; orientation anchored early, one tightening via sand-to-pavilion deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (damp sandstone, wet earth ozone, cool sand) mirrors internal smoothing quest and constrains choices like dune walk to tidal pool; recurring dampness recharges final fortress image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of smoothing remorse tightens accumulatively through sand transmission then pavilion flood, with agency in touches and endurance forcing trade-off (overwhelm risk); cost legible but escalation lacks one deeper option-narrowing turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of healing jagged remorse emerges organically via tasting/touching/subsume actions, resonant in final "jagged...no longer" reconfiguration without moralizing; counter-reading of self-sacrifice lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with sensory-biased perceptual signature (memory flavors, touch contagion); rhythmic modulation supports accumulative build, though minor filter-verb stacks dull sand-touch immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops on "memories"/"remorse" (e.g., repeated "sorrow and regret" variants across kitchen-to-dunes) and synonym churn dull density in mid-beats; figurative strain ("tone sturdy and brittle") muddles pavilion peak without payoff.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting chef, desert-ocean coral pavilion, and touch contagion transforms healing trope via sandpaper metaphor grown from particulars; risk in surreal pavilion logic pays off in charged closure.</comment>
