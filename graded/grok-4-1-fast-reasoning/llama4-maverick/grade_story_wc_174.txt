<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>No internal conflict or contradictory impulses; Amaranth's traits remain static without pressure-tested micro-choices, rendering motivation declarative rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds atmospheric serenity, but closure lacks decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost—"sense of satisfaction" feels unearned without foreclosed path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (flickering light, pen scratching, creaks) integrate with action; dome as recurring micro-setting charges final sanctuary image, constraining creative isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>No dominant stake signaled or tightened; abstract mission faces zero opposition or trade-off, with no on-page reversal under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of subversive storytelling emerges organically from crafting but lacks ambiguity or counter-readings; final image of stick jingling offers mild resonance without reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with character-biased perception of hush; rhythmic prose modulates serenity effectively, though minor repetition erodes perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("serene atmosphere," "ideas flowed," dome repetitions across paragraphs) create template cadence and synonym churn, dulling propulsion throughout; artifacts pervade without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dome-to-sanctuary premise offers fresh inflection on surveillance/creativity tension; originality limited by generic epiphany arc and untransformed calligrapher trope.</comment>
