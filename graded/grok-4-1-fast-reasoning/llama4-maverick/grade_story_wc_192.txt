<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Keeper's motivation to preserve and revive sanctuary is consistent and intensifies through gentle actions like grasping the ring and tending the flame, earning the final reconnection. Interiority remains metaphorical rather than deeply embodied with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, as in the "heart ached with a mix of sorrow and longing."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as shadow density and memory weight build to resonant reconfiguration at the flame revival and keeper's forward step, with legible cost of isolation foreclosed. Continuous scene anchors early ("ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight"), one meaningful deepening via scar-linking into descent suffices. Closure Charged Poise lands on-page with ethereal ring glow reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details like "shadows, like dark tentacles, wrapped around the keeper's heart" integrate into action, mirroring internal paradox; doorknocker ring recurs to constrain opening choice and charge final image. Atmosphere tensions isolation with emerging vitality, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of threshold revival signaled early tightens accumulatively through shadow descent and memory navigation, narrowing isolation options with emotional ache as felt cost. Keeper's agency in scar-linking and flame touch drives deepening; no reversals needed under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of isolation-reconnection emerges organically from shadow-wrapping and flame revival, culminating in non-literal final image where keeper steps forward, reweighting "teach suffocating to breathe" without statement. Particulars like loaded emptiness avoid tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature in biased noticing (e.g., shadows as tentacles tied to heart), rhythmic syntax modulates from melancholy to peace. Compression purposeful and pattern-taught early for lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short echoes in descent, longer rebirth), high density in multi-job lines like "The keeper's touch was gentle... yet their actions were always calculated." Minor shadow-synonym churn and metaphor density in peak descent deduct without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow-tending metaphor transforms isolation trope via scar-linking and suffocation motif into inevitable rebirth image. Bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
