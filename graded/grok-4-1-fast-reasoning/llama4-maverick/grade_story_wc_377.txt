<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Aria lacks interior contradiction, embodied emotions, or micro-choices under pressure; traits told via labels like "calling" without conflicting impulses acting in scene. No flaws complicate choices or reveal hierarchy of values. Inhabitants collective and passive, no relationships as crucible. Final "work was done" feels unearned without prior causal buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds via repeating images to Charged Poise/CR in final paragraphs ("sculpture stood firm, a testament"), reweighting words-to-heart shift with conceptual cost of transcendence. Orientation anchored early (Aria on bluff by para 2). Continuous scene fits scope, but no meaningful tightening narrows options; vignette stasis lacks drive cadence shift until vague end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Whispering Bluff, kinetic sculpture, and iceberg fragment vividly sensory (glistening light, gentle hum, winds), integrated into action/perception; bluff above clouds pressures isolation, sculpture/iceberg charge final image. POV bias selective to harmonics/wonder. No white-room; evolves causally with winds/season. Micro-setting (sculpture) constrains craft and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>No dominant stake escalation under Accumulative lens; abstract "symphonies of truth" lacks on-page reversal, narrowing, or agency-driven deepening. Iceberg arrival coincidental, not complicating pressure. No visible cost forecloses path; static harmony without trade-off or moral calculus. Final era shift declared, not earned via coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of art transcending words emerges via sculpture images, iceberg reprise shifts to beacon role. Subtext in "era after words" lingers with ambiguity of heart language. Final image ("sculpture glistens... reminder") non-literal answer reweights particulars. Repetitive assertions like "symphonies of truth" border thematic echo, reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person POV with perceptual signature (vibrations, harmonics); voice texture poetic/rhythmic, modulates to hum at end. No head-hopping or withholding; diction purposeful (glisten, resonate). Experimental lyric compression legible under lens. No dialogue to judge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops ("symphonies of truth" x8, "glistens/glistening" repetitive, "beacon/testament/reminder" synonym churn in final third dulls closure image). Template cadence in descriptive runs ("As the [winds/seasons/clouds]..., the [sculpture/bluff]"). Density low, redundancies stall propulsion. Artifacts pervade, capping high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Fresh mystical synthesis (iceberg on bluff, kinetic sculpture amplifying truth) transforms tropes via harmonics-to-heart era. Bold lyric risk heightens resonance without gimmick. But pseudo-profound abstractions ("color of wonder," "language of the heart") feel templated, not grounded in specific emotional truth.</comment>
