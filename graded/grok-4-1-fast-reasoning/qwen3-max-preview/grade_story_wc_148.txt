<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation rooted in father's legacy drives micro-choices like prying the lattice and sealing the lens, with embodied contradiction in trembling defiance; final renunciation of personal storytelling earns closure via visible exhaustion and spectral witnesses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as actions densify toward CR closure—lattice wedged into lens fractures light, trapping truths with conceptual cost in the final sealing image; orientation anchored early at iron gate, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse prison and jagged reef constrain climb and ghost ascent, with lattice as micro-setting charging the mechanism housing; recurring "copperlight repose" mirrors internal shift in final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—to embed truth before bodies found—tightens accumulatively via ghost summoning, forcing seal with legible cost (boy spent, search party crunching gravel); agency in pressing lattice forecloses hiding path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of disbelieved truths emerges via lattice-enabled voices in light, reweighting premise in non-literal final flare without moralizing; resonant image of whispers riding beam answers central question of belief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with poetic perceptual signature ("brine and candle wax," "salt-stung" hands); single dialogue line raw and goal-driven; rhythmic modulation supports pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative overload ("folding space like origami," "noose of mistrust") in climax slightly dulls propulsion; no loops, closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Boy Who Cried Wolf via spectral witnesses and confessional lattice transforms trope; risk in supernatural lattice sustains impossibility, inevitable in hindsight at lens-sealing.</comment>
