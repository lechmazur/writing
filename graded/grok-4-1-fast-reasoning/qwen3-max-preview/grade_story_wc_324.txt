<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tracer's persistent curiosity and professional competence drive micro-choices like kneeling and broadcasting resonance, earning the closure handshake; girl's fractured grief embodies vulnerability without stereotypes. Internal urgency sharpens embodied ("syncopated ache") without diagnostic labels. Minor deduction for tracer's unflawed competence lacking blind-spot friction in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: photo vibration → hearing aid tuning → pulse-following → girl discovery → resonance broadcast → synchronized exit with thinning mist as RR/Charged Poise. Orientation anchored early (atrium, twilight, photo). Closure cost legible in "echo finally at rest" image foreclosing endless waiting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atrium's mist, condensation, wet stone constrain movement and mirror emotional haze thinning at closure; fountain lilies as "surrendered hands" charge girl encounter. Sensory hierarchy (wet stone/roses over visuals) reflects tracer's pulse-focus. Recurrent glass/dew evolves causally with resolution; micro-setting (hearing aid as tool) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve festering echo) signaled early, tightens causally via panicked pulse-flutter narrowing to broadcast choice; girl's "wait here" forces renunciation. Agency in extending hand forecloses isolation with felt cost (decades' grief). Enters 8+ via trade-off but lacks secondary loss complicating final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of love's enduring frequency emerges via photo/hearing aid pulses reweighting girl's waiting; incidental heroism crystallizes in "choice to kneel in the damp" without moralizing. Final image (calm photo between them) offers non-literal answer. Counter-reading (hauntings fester) lingers via prior "unanswered echoes."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with tracer's perceptual signature (rhythmic pulses over visuals); voice modulates from curious whisper to urgent hush. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("They're not coming back" pursues assurance goal). Rhythmic control heightens climax without head-hopping or elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "vibrated faintly... syncopated ache" advances plot/character/atmosphere); varied syntax propels from hush to surge. Dense figuratives ("wings against glass," "lullaby hummed through cathedral walls") purposeful for tone, no muddle or loops. Minor scaffold in opening backstory summary (−0.3); closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story via emotional frequencies/hearing aid transforms tropes organically; risk in "broadcast counter-pulse" heightens stakes uniquely. Premise commits to rules (pulses in objects) without retreat, inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; bold perceptual frame memorable.</comment>
