<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Relic keeper's motivation to harvest insights from failure roots every micro-choice, from precise driftwood arrangement to notebook transcriptions in the between-place; interiority concrete via trembling fingers and embodied precision. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in weighing Council's "Never again" against hollow eyes of realms. Final renunciation—leaving flute as monument—earned with felt cost of spent resonance, shifting her to keeper of thresholds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup (uncasing flute) through between-place echoes to CR closure in final image of driftwood compass and silent oracle, reweighting failure as necessary collapse. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (relic keeper in Thunder-echo Range). Cost legible in "flute lay cold... resonance spent" and her internalized warnings.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy: ash-colored sand, canyon hush pressing eardrums constrain precision of driftwood markers calibrated to wind's memory. Recurring "canyon hush" evolves, deepening post-return to charge final pilgrims' scene. Micro-setting (cracked amphitheater, ghost delta wood) guides entry to harmonic node and mirrors internal autopsy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest failure insights) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via realm realizations (too loud/timid/perfect), narrowing to renunciation with cost of resonance spent and flute abandoned. Agency in exhales coaxing seam and notebook amid unravelings; pressure coheres without reversal overload. Climax witnessing feels deepening under textural lens, though internal stakes dominate over visceral rupture risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of weaving ethics emerges organically from particulars: Verdantis/Silmara/Khyren failures answer "when to play, when to pause," resonant in codex questions and pilgrims' offerings honoring collapse. Final image reweights premise—flute as monument of quiet avalanche—with non-literal cost of necessary failures, inviting ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature: hushed, poetic noticing ("silence so dense it pressed against eardrums," "time pooled like water in cupped hands"). Rhythmic modulation accelerates in between-place echoes, breathes in return hush; purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens. No elision or head-hopping; diction biased to relic-keeper's autopsy precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "shadows pooled like spilled ink between the driftwood markers" advances atmosphere/action). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent and purposeful ("reed brittle as old vows"). Minor figurative density in between-place holds pattern without muddling closure image of lichen-surrendered flute.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: autopsy of world-weaving failures via echo-not-song transforms relic trope into ethical monument, with risk-taking in quiet CR ending ("some doors stay open by staying closed"). Irreplaceable particulars like driftwood compass heighten stakes organically; hindsight inevitability in harvesting from collapse clears path.</comment>
