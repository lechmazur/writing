<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (old rage untethered, floating in hush) act in scene via patient listening and relic grip; final relic swap earned by prior causality with relational cost legible in shared grief. Interiority concrete via drawer pull grooves as memory talisman. No unearned epiphanies; flaws (past rage) complicate to enable wisdom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of revelations and relic exchange builds to Charged Poise RR closure ("swapping ghosts") with conceptual cost in foreclosed enmity, on-page in descent together. Orientation anchored early (parapet, mist, negotiator). Single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist and windblown parapet constrain vulnerability/exposure, pressuring first currency of reconciliation; drawer pull as micro-setting charges final pocket touch. Sensory hierarchy (mist curling boots, wind moaning stone) reflects thoughtful POV bias. Evolves causally (mist thickens, swallows behind).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prisoner exchange to ghost swap) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via relic revelations narrowing to shared path; cost felt in memorized names and relic weight. Agency in proposing neutral ground and accepting key forecloses division with on-page emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (recycling mistakes into wisdom via silence/vulnerability) emerges organically from relic exchange and hush; final shared path image offers resonant non-literal answer ("seeds neither dared plant alone") reweighting prior loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with lyrical perceptual signature (breaths with moon tides, pauses in bravado); voice modulates rhythmically under pressure. Dialogue subtextual/goal-driven ("Did you bring the names you buried?"), distinct idioms (rasped weary vs. measured). No head-hopping; elision purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "She synchronized her breaths... gibbous"); minor metaphor density in reflections (-0.3) but no muddle or loops touching closure. Rhythm varies read-aloud; no scaffold, clean syntax emphasizes relics ("cold and heavy").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic swap as hinge for reconciliation transforms prisoner trope via moon phases and hush; risk-taking in lyric accumulative frame heightens emotional stakes organically. Final "boots stepping in time" inevitable from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
