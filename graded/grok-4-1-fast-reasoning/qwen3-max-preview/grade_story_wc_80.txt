<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait yields in weeping ("salt mingling with brackish water"), embodying contradiction with cost; ritual micro-choices align with dream-archeologist motivation, earning endurance at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ritual density to letter discovery; Charged Poise RR lands on-page with ink depletion cost ("inkwell empty"), clarifying Elara.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pavilion's "groaning beams" and "silt swirling" constrain descents and charge final "sigh"; inkwell reservoir evolution mirrors stakes, filtering through surveyor's ritual gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake of countering oblivion tightens via letter piercing stoicism; ink emptying and emotional yield foreclose indifferent surveying with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Notes and bride's letter reprice absence as "layered silence" into presence; final refilling answers dream-archeology without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("algal-streaked steps," "barnacle-crowns") sustains single POV; rhythm modulates from hushed ritual to emotional peak without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, propelling accumulation; consistent water/entropy metaphors avoid muddle, though opening density risks slight overwrite before tightening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inkwell-ritual transforms surveyor trope into priestess of memory; poetic immersion risks pay off in pavilion's responsive "sigh."</comment>
