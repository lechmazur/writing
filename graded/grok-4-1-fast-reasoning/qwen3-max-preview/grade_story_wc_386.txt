<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in salvaging echoes, embodied in ritual actions like tracing the globe and sinking into its memory-stream; micro-choices reveal values without contradiction. Minor abstract telling ("weaves truth carefully") dilutes peak embodiment, but no unearned epiphanies or safety-hedging flaws undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dream fragments and cameos builds to memory-stream realization and globe placement as Charged Poise RR with release cost (child's cameos fade). Orientation anchored early (shrine, her role); one tightening via palms-on-altar beat narrows to fulfillment without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glacier shrine, melted globe, and ice window recess constrain ritual choices and charge final image (ripples reform streets). Sensory details (breath curling, unnervingly warm globe) filtered through her priorities, evolve causally (ice "remembering").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve child's echo) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via dream-mapping to on-page memory-sink and placement, foreclosing cameos with felt release cost. Agency in altar communion and recess-setting crystallizes stance under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragile connections emerges organically from cameos, windows, and globe reform; final image (window within window) reweights "protect something" without moralizing. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (icy-watery diction, biased noticing of echoes); stable single-POV distance modulates poetically for ritual intensity, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm, purposeful figuratives (ice remembering) taught early and payoff-charged without muddle or loops; propulsion peaks in "ice around it ripples" image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diving and dream-analysis ghosts transforms tropes; glacier-window climax and ripple-ripples in strangers' dreams feel inevitable, bold lyric risk heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
