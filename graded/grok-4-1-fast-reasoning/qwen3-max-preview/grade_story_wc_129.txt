<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in loneliness shown through reed sculptures as pleas evolving to announcements; contradictory impulses in seeking via hidden clues resolve in earned dedication. Micro-choices like braiding clues and trusting the note reveal values under pressure. Minor abstraction in "luminescent ache" borders label-speak but embodies without therapy overtones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from solitary sculptures to communal offerings via patterned discoveries (tag, note, arbor). Orientation anchored early (crater rim, orchard). Closure as RR (arbor integration) lands on-page with conceptual cost of braided loneliness, reconfiguring belonging.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting vivid and selective (quartz humming starlight, amethyst path, weeping grove dripping light) filters through sculptor's perceptual bias, constraining path (northwest clues, arbor threshold) and charging final arbor flare. Sensory hierarchy matches rising resonance; spatial choreography coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grafting to community) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via notices (glass lily, child) and note to arbor confrontation; agency in following/trusting forecloses isolation with felt relational cost in communal emergence. One deepening suffices; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of resonance-forged kinship emerges organically from particulars (tags, sculptures, glyphs); final arbor pattern and welcoming sculptures offer non-literal answer reweighting loneliness to bridges without moralizing. Subtext in silent communion; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with lyrical perceptual signature (noticing spirals, glyphs pulsing like veins); voice texture modulates rhythmically from ache to hush. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You sculpt absence into presence"); no head-hopping, diction POV-plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric metaphors (reed spirals trembling like breath, glyphs as startled fish) taught early, no loops or scaffolds; rhythm varies for propulsion, syntax supports emotional cadence. Minor overwriting in descriptive runs but coherence intact, no closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic artist-community weaving in crystalline world transforms belonging trope; arbor as memory-loom and sigil integration feel inevitable from reed pleas. Bold poetic risks heighten resonance without gimmickry; no derivative echoes.</comment>
