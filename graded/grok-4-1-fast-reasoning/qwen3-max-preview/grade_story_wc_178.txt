<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (rational mind communing via "magic" as undiscovered physics) act in scene through precise actions like aligning the tile with Sirius; final endurance of wrapping the tile is earned by sacrifices like selling his cloak, with visible cost in knees protesting and frugal vigils. Interiority particular via "empirically ironic" self-reflection tied to micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of schematics builds to breeze-Sirius-tile hum ("vibrating in sympathy"), delivering Charged Poise closure at "Confirmed" with conceptual cost of unseen devotion pulsing beneath empires. Orientation anchored early in ziggurat terrace; single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via crumbling stair climbed alone and obsidian floor for schematics, charging final image of chamber in indigo twilight; sensory hierarchy (chalk dust, low hum) reflects astronomer's priorities, mirroring internal devotion without overt symbolism. Micro-setting like tile dais guides alignment ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seal covenant) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through schematic density to hum confirmation, narrowing to endurance with felt cost of lifelong frugality ("sold his winter cloak"); agency in sketching and noting wavelength forces stance crystallization. Minor abstractness in stakes pre-hum slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic order's quiet endurance emerges organically from frugal rituals amid decaying palace; final image of tile as "dormant god" and devotion pulsing "like a neutron star" offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting rational devotion with ironic profundity, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature in "ratios and angles," "angular momentum"; rhythmic control modulates from weary precision to slowed "syrup under moonlight," heightening dusky texture without elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with lines like "each glyph corresponded to a planetary transit" advancing character/world; varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, coherent metaphors (ripples, chord) purposeful in lyric mode. Minor repetition of "empirically ironic" borders paraphrase but taught as voice tic without obscuring hum closure.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Babylonian ziggurat as math-observatory with magic square summoning resonance transforms tropes; risk of lyric accumulative devotion amid empire-collapse feels inevitable, heightened by "neutron star" reconfiguration without gimmickry.</comment>
