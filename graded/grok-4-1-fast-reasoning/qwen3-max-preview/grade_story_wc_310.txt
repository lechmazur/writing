<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied (tremor in molars, warmth in chest); contradictory surrender to lots vs. reclamation earns final step forward. Micro-choices like pressing drachma to forehead reveal values under doubt. Flaw of stellar doubt complicates and softens authentically without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from coin-tracing to unbidden static/vision to realization. Orientation anchored early (deck, post-collapse). Closure as CR in "She understood, then... stepped forward" with felt cost of reclaimed choices, reweighting prior surrender.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ambered deck, honeyed light, cracked glass constrain listening/decision space and mirror contraction. Recurrent coins handled tactilely, charge final toss on glass. Sensory hierarchy (bone/breath over ears) reflects POV bias, selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose alignment) signaled early, escalates via unbidden vision deepening to surge/lullaby realization under accumulative lens. Agency in pressing coin/gathering/standing forecloses lots-path with cost of softened doubt. Final toss narrows to forward step with legible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of meaning from entropy emerges via visions/coins without statement; final "distillate" image reweights surrender as guided choice. Minor friction: speech line (“We’re the distillate”) borders echo but integrates via prior static bursts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (resonant/cosmic diction: "pulsar," "wavelength"). Rhythm modulates from meditative to surging warmth. Brief dialogue natural, goal-pursuing, voice-distinct; no head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied syntax/rhythm propel without loops; figurative pattern (stellar metaphors) taught early, coheres/payoffs at closure. No scaffolds, clarity in peak vision-shatter. Minor density in opening but advances texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: coin-static for backwards prophecy post-contraction transforms entropy tropes via textural resonance. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight in vision-echo realization. Bold non-causal drive feels organic.</comment>
