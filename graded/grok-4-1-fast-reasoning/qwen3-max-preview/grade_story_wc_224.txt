<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Seer's motivation rooted in sharpened memory pain intensifies through embodied textures like "obsidian wind" and trembling fingers, compelling the seeding choice; contradictory impulses (rebuilding world nightly yet seeking true home) act in scene, earning arrival without tidy epiphany. Final kneeling in recognition forecloses fractured adaptation with felt cost. Interiority particular via synesthetic perception, no stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: textural density builds from stone's hum to feather's tactile glow, stone cracking, and shelves rearranging into archway RR (Charged Poise) with cost in dissolved feather and stilled stone. Orientation anchored early in sub-basement; single scene, no shards. Closure reconfigures belonging with undeniable resonance, constraint of relic shaping final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting of stone, feather, and shifting shelves constrains choices (feather guides fingers, shelves form archway) and charges final room image. Sensory details selective and POV-biased toward textures (mercury slide, dew-slicked tile, raven barb), mirroring internal states without overt symbols. Atmosphere purposeful, mountain groans breathing with her exhale.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seeding home's shape) signaled early, escalates via textural density from exhaled breath to feather's pressure-guidance and chest-tightening recognition, narrowing to reconfiguration under Accumulative lens. Agency in deliberate exhale and following guidance forecloses substitution path; cost felt in "sharpened... slicing" memory and feather's dissolution. One tightening sufficient, charges final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of home as frequency emerges organically from textural particulars (feather barb, stone ripple, shadow angles), reweighting premise in final room without statement. Resonance in "sanctuary returning," countering nightly substitutions with belonging's cost. Subtext in feather's imprint invites ambiguity on memory's pain, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in synesthetic textures ("scent of rain on cedar shingles"); voice modulates rhythmically, compressing under pressure (feather dissolves into vapor). Elevated diction fits seer's lexicon, syntax reflects fractured soul. No head-hopping or withholding; elision purposeful in lost language.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies lyrically, sentence openings diverse, high density in textures advances momentum; purposeful metaphors coherent without muddle. Minor overwriting in peak ("glow... with pressure — a tactile luminescence") risks density dip but supports textural lens payoff at stone cracking. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seer awakening buried talents via relic textures transforms tropes into resonant geometry of home; risk in synesthetic method heightens stakes. Final reconfiguration inevitable from feather-seeding pattern, no derivative echoes. Bold voice commits to premise without retreat.</comment>
