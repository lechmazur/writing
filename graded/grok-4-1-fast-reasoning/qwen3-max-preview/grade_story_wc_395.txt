<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and contradictory impulses shine in lies to self/supervisor/janitor, earning final endurance as anchor; embodied attention to silence pulses throughout. Minor slip in occasional diagnostic phrasing like "descent into something deeper" but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly from patch/numbers buildup to CR closure ("They linger. They wait."), with cost legible in her ongoing role; orientation anchored immediately in archive/terminal. No debt, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Server hums/frosted glass/patch constrain restore choice and charge final image; sensory gaps (flicker/stutter) mirror theme without catalog. Micro-setting (vault, drives) evolves tactilely, POV-biased to absences.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover dereferenced crew) escalates via density (numbers -> resonance flood), agency in restore narrows to endurance; cost felt in "descent" and anchor role. Minor abstractness in early stakes declaration but tightens on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of lingering absences emerges organically from gaps/resonance, final image ("humming back") reweights premise with conceptual cost of eternal vigilance, no moralizing. Resonant without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (silence as scream, ghost pixels) and rhythmic modulation under pressure; stable close-third POV with lyric compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively; purposeful metaphors (resonance chamber, de-referenced) cohere without muddle. Minor density slip in reflective blocks but no loops/artifacts touch peak restore beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital hauntology transforms tropes (ghosts in data gaps); Helios-7 dereferencing feels inevitable, bold lyric risk heightens closure without gimmick. Fully committed premise.</comment>
