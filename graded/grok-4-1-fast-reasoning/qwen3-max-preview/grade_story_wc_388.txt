<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sharply observant trait embodied in "each petal’s tremor, each branch’s lean, whispering data"; internal thrill "fingers trembled—not from fear" conflicts with sorrow at "every orchard like this buried under lies," earning forward march with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from observation to diamond press where "dust storm stuttered"; Charged Poise closure in plaque coordinates and diamond "beat like a second heart" reconfigures truth as portable, with sorrow cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard constrains choice—"pressing the diamond into the soil near the tree’s roots"—repelling storm; recurring roots/bees mirror internal defiance, charging final "roots humming the frequency only the sharply observant could hear."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake to excavate truth tightens via diamond test yielding plaque network, narrowing to "reassembling the world’s broken pieces"; protagonist agency drives, cost in sorrow and "refused to let silence be the last word" felt but slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of rooted truth emerges implicitly via reassembled letters/orchard/diamond uncursed; final "truth didn’t hide. It rooted" non-literal resonant answer reweights lies without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in biased noticing—"growth rings aligned with storm cycles, not seasons"—stable single POV; rhythmic diction modulates from howl to "silence descending like a held breath."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion—"petals drifting like embers"—varied rhythm; minor paraphrase loops in "reassembling" motif purposeful under textural lens, no artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apoc sanctuary via resonant crystals transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight via diamond's "flawed by design" payoff.</comment>
