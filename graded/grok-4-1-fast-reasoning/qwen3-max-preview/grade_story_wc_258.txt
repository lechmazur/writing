<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Steadily curious trait shown concretely in methodical logging and measuring, aligning actions with mapping motive; interiority particular via ink-stained fingers and journal confiding. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal scene for deeper conflict. Visitor interaction reveals values without major relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from journal entry to pattern convergence and visitor's realization as Conceptual Repricing closure, cost felt in worn tape and heavier ledger. Orientation anchored early in loft and post-crash world. One tightening via overlaid trajectories narrows to recognition without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and measuring tape as micro-settings constrain choices and charge final image where tape unspools again. Sensory details (droplets as glyphs, ink bleeding) filtered through cartomancer's perceptual bias, mirroring internal mapping. Post-crash city evolves consistently, pressuring isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping cultural resilience signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern density to visitor crystallization under Textural lens. Agency in endurance/attention forecloses chaos reading with conceptual cost in ongoing work. Tightening at phoenix stencil convergence forces stance reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of recomposition emerges implicitly from fragments to "remembering forward" realization, final image reweights symbols-over-numbers premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like QR phoenix and chalk equations avoids platitudes. Subtext in shared phrases charges ending organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mapping metaphors (tide heights, emotional payload) with rhythmic control modulating from steady curiosity to recognition. Third-person close stable, no head-hopping; diction reflects cartomancer's methodical mind. Brief dialogue natural, goal-driven in invitation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (rain as impatient fingers) advancing atmosphere; varied rhythm supports accumulative build. Minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but coheres without muddle at closure. No loops, scaffold, or template cadence; propulsion clear to final unspooling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy as cultural reverse-engineering post-crypto crash transforms divination trope organically. Risky poetic compression heightens stakes in pattern-mapping without gimmickry. Final visitor exchange feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
