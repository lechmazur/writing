<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to find beauty in incomplete drives all micro-choices, from tracing ripples to weaving kite; feather as compass reveals particular worldview. Boy's shift from hollow to alight eyes earned via her reframing. Contradictory gentleness amid grief acts in scene, with final empty hands/ full heart as earned stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images build from lagoon ripples to snapped string to wobbly kite flight. Orientation anchored in first paragraph. Closure as Charged Poise in whisper and kite dance reconfigures loss with felt cost of asymmetry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon and wet sand constrain path to dune and kite launch, mirroring internal fractures. Seaglass patches and feather integrate tactilely into mend. Recurrent water/foam charges final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tending incomplete beauty signaled early, tightens via kite-weaving reversal that narrows to "differently" flight. Agency in harmonizing forces boy's stance shift; cost legible in wobble/scars. Minor abstractness in grief keeps under 9.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of harmony in discord emerges via particulars like feather discard and woven scraps, answered non-literally by kite's scarred dance. Final whisper reweights snapped string without moralizing. Complexity in surrender's beauty lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in tide/foam metaphors biases noticing. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("Not the kite. You."); boy's idiom distinct. Rhythm modulates from hush to laugh without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "half-sung note, unfinished verse"; varied rhythm passes ear test. Purposeful lyric metaphors cohere without muddle in peak mend. Minor density dip in opening images, but propulsion clear to closure.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drake feather philosophy transforming kite grief into "woven dawns"; risks lyric poise over plot without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight from incomplete motif. Bold asymmetry praise heightens stakes organically.</comment>
