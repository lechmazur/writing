<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as "terminally curious" drives consistent micro-choices like repurposing the parasol tip, with embodied resentment of "reprieves" creating contradiction; final renunciation of euthanasia earned by glacier sigh realization. Contradictory impulses act in the floe-boarding choice, revealing values hierarchy with isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory patterns (creaks, snaps) build density to parasol chime fall—"low, wet chime"—triggering CR closure where realization reweights endings as "thresholds that sing," with conceptual cost in foreclosed euthanasia path legible in final volunteering shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Parasol tip as micro-setting constrains choices (tapped for resonance, falls to trigger shear hearing) and charges final image ("vibrated faintly... cool against her pulse"). Sensory hierarchy (auditory decay over visuals) reflects Elara's bias; ice slip on "black ice" pressures climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn ending's sound) signaled early tightens via fall reversal, narrowing to glacier hearing and floe choice; agency in boarding forecloses marina safety with half-frozen cost felt on-page. Accumulative cadence shift reweights to transition-music under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of patience's fold emerges via particulars (shelf "sigh," lace "unraveling"); final image ("let it flow through her, windborne solace") offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of auditory decay ("hush before collapse"); rhythmic modulation peaks at "sigh... mother humming," teaching compression pattern paid off in charged poise ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "groan of ice slowed... wind paused mid-sigh" varies rhythm without loops; metaphors cohere (lace/ice breath) in peak fall beat, no artifacts dulling closure image of vibrating tip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourism as sonic quest via parasol tuning fork on ice marina transforms death tropes; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes, inevitable CR from particulars.</comment>
