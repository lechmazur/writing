<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation roots deeply in father's journal and embodied grief, with micro-choices like placing the aster compelling the closure step-through; contradictory impulses in cataloging anomalies despite fearlessness feel earned. Interiority particular via coffee-sifting ritual mirroring neural voids.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns (grounds to galaxy to skeleton to doorway) tightens to on-page CR closure as Elira steps through, pooling time with suspended tears as felt cost; oriented early via whale and chamber.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Salt crystals and gravity pockets constrain choices (hovering dust, rippling hair) and charge final image (chiming crystals syncing heartbeat); sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward distortions and blooms, vivid without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover memories) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening patterns narrowing to doorway agency; cost legible in suspended tears and foreclosed ordinary reality at reunion.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of displaced memory emerges organically from grounds, flowers, gravity particulars reweighted in pooled-time reunion; final "silence gleamed" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in anomaly-noticing; diction/rhythm modulate to charged poise at threshold, father's brief lines natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: sentences multi-job (e.g., "The spiral galaxy dissolved" advances plot/atmosphere); no loops, metaphors coherent (ribs as buttresses), rhythm peaks cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tasseography, gravity-memory storage, whale as catalyst transforms fabulist tropes; risk in poetic compression inevitable at "memories floated like jellyfish," heightening stakes organically.</comment>
