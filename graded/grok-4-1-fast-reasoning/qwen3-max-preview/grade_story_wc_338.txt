<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral motivation rooted in childhood maps intensifies to compel witnessing over excavation; embodied tears at "not from sorrow, but from recognition" earn closure renunciation with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as footage overlays build spiral pattern to CR closure in shadow silhouette; map tear anchors orientation early, cost legible in "heart unarmored yet guarded by awe."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Damp stone, weeping arches, and oculus dusk constrain waiting choice and charge final shadow image; sensory details (runoff-erased frescoes, moss metronome) mirror internal hush purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to interpret silence tightens via spiral discovery, forcing endurance in dusk vigil; agency in patient waiting forecloses digging with emotional price crystallized at silhouette reveal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Silence-as-vessel theme emerges from shadow choreography and map tear, reweighted non-literally in chapel's "folded" breath; yarrow sprig offers resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (empathetic stone-brushing, silence-hearing) biases details character-specifically; rhythmic modulation peaks in terse "It wasn’t erosion. It wasn’t trick of light."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "cartographic wound she’d spent three years tracing"; figurative density in revelation ("breath held then released") borders overwrought but supports textural propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival footage and shadow choreography transforms ruin trope into empathetic negative-space altar; risk-taking lyric compression inevitable in "whispers finally, gently, answered."</comment>
