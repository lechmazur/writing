<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and embodied guilt culminate in the earned tethering choice with blood cost, revealing contradictory impulses as she faces "You left me in the static" without flinching.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through motif buildup to on-page RR closure ("Static dissolved into sighs"); cost legible in glyph burn and firmware weeping; orientation anchored early in lab.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lab's lost sounds and amber constrain choices (console placement, arm press), charging final constellation image; sensory hierarchy reflects tattooist's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant guilt-stake tightens via agency in singing and tethering under textural lens, foreclosing erasure path with blood price; father's voice tests commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of cry-translation to forgiveness emerges organically from particulars, answered non-literally by "maps not to lost children, but to forgiveness" reweighting cries motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in star/sound diction modulates with intensity; stable close-third POV; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and rhythmic variety propel; figurative pattern taught early avoids muddle, though peak-beat density ("time stitching itself") borders overwriting without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tattoo-soul tethering and glitch-regrets transforms tropes; glyph emergence from amber feels inevitable, risking bold surrealism that heightens stakes.</comment>
