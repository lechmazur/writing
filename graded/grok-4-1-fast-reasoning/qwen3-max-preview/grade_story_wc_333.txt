<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Locksmith's motivation intensifies through micro-choices like tying the crimson ribbon amid pleading mirrors, revealing contradictory solidarity without flinching; interiority embodied in "pulse sync with his own." Final cupping earned by prior fear-facing, with wrist-ribbon cost foreclosing fear-carrying. Exceptional under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery density builds from star-thread to mirrors to light-point CR, reweighting locked idea with nexus-sigh cost; orientation anchored in first paragraph. One tightening via ribbon-shatter suffices. Closure cost legible in "frost of centuries-old dread" melting against carried glow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Moonstone arch, cosmic dust, shadow/starlight door constrain path and charge mirrors passage; recurring starlight evolves from hint to leaning closer, mirroring release. Sensory hierarchy mythic-POV filtered; final nexus sigh integrates environment into closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free fear-trapped idea) signaled early, tightens via mirrors opposition forcing ribbon renunciation; agency in gentle placement/cupping forecloses fear-path with solidarity kneel cost. Escalation accumulative, pressure coheres to carried-idea poise under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme (unarmored love reweaves worlds) emerges via hair-lock/idea-bird particulars, resonant CR in child's unflinching speech reweighting fear-premise without moral. Subtext in ribbon-promise ambiguity lingers; no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in cosmic-noticing ("air thick with cosmic dust"); rhythmic modulation heightens hush-to-sigh cadence. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at door-seal closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "ribbon trembled...from recognition"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, figurative coherent (stardust shatter). Propulsion peaks in corridor collapse without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-vault locksmith transforms tropes via hair-key/idea-bird, risk-taking in lyric-mythic frame heightens CR stakes; inevitable hindsight from star-thread onward.</comment>
