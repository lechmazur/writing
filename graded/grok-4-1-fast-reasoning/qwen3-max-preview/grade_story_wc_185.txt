<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exemplary single-POV interiority via embodied attunement ("bare feet reading the cave floor like braille") and micro-choices (tracing fissures, calibrated humming) that reveal cartographic traits under pressure; earned endurance in "hammered repose" face shows competent struggle without safety-hedging. No contradictory impulses acting simultaneously drags from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably in one continuous scene with early orientation; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly when stone releases hush into central being ("It curled around the stone, cradling it like an egg"), reweighting chaos to balance with felt cost in melting ice and heavy stone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting as micro-world constrains choices (ice fractures as "scores" dictate humming pitch) and charges final image (caves now "breathed"); sensory hierarchy (vibrations over visuals) reflects POV bias with purposeful evolution from screams to sighs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conjure quiet) escalates via density increase under lens (hush blooms "radially, a ripple in the storm’s fabric"); agency in offering stone forecloses banishment path with on-page cost in beings' settling drift and stone's dimming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence as "architecture" emerges organically from ice-memory scores and hush-tuning; final image ("bloom of hush had taken root") offers non-literal reconfiguration of chaos without moralizing, reweighting premise with conceptual cost of tuned imbalance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (vibration-attuned noticing) and rhythmic modulation (short sighs amid longer drifts); purposeful lyric compression taught early enhances closure legibility without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm mirroring hush bloom ("moss unfurling over stone"); consistent figurative pattern (resonance metaphors) purposeful without muddle or loops, though peak density borders overwriting in radial spread beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of map-skin cartography, ice-whisper scores, and hush-weaponizing transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in textural lens heightens stakes, with skin-glow reprise feeling inevitable at "already listening for the next fracture."</comment>
