<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied recognition at ripple-induced images ("chest tightened—not with fear, but with recognition") earns the empathy spark with prior hollowness; internal conflict subtle but present in jaded armor against awe. Minor abstract motivation phrasing ("kindle empathy where none remains") borders label-speak but anchors choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via image density to charged poise closure (ball drifts, seeker turns carrying "resonance"); cost legible in unretrieved ball and foreclosed retrieval path. Orientation anchored early at lake edge; single scene fits scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake constrains toss action and charges fractal ripples/closure image; tactile details (ozone air, wet stone) filter via seeker's hollow priorities. Sensory evolution mirrors escalation without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kindle empathy) signaled early tightens accumulatively via ball-toss reversal narrowing to recognition; agency in release forecloses path with felt proximity to pain. Cost unmistakable in "spark" amid unlived paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of buried choices emerges via fractal ripples/submerged objects reweighting past ignorances; final "map inside—not as memory, but as resonance" offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Particulars drive complexity over platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (jaded wonder in "squinted eyes over damp newspaper") with rhythmic modulation; Kael's dialogue subtextual ("read the silence") advances via implication. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "branching fractals") coherent without muddle. Minor density in opening reflection but no loops or scaffolds dulling peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory wipe, coded newspapers, choice-lake transforms tropes organically; time-traveler ball risks bold premise payoff in release without gimmick. Hindsight inevitability in labyrinth-to-resonance arc.</comment>
