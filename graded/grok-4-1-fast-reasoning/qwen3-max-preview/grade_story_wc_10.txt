<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in self-test with A440 fork syncing to chest pride; motivation roots in consistent resolve without stock epiphanies. Minimal contradictory impulses limit to very strong; final palm-on-ground endurance earned via prior activations with felt cost of her silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from fountain fracture to room-by-room ripples, culminating in Charged Poise closure where conservatory's thrum reconfigures silence with undeniable emotional cost felt in her smile and closed eyes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory vividly anchors with ice-limned panes, suspended ferns constraining strikes; final "conservatory hummed—silent, radiant, alive" charges image, mirroring internal resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to translate silence escalates accumulatively from self-test to dawn symphony, narrowing options via frozen responses; protagonist agency in fork selections drives, with cost of persistent silence legible in "her skin heard."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of presence in silence emerges organically from thermal hotspots and activations; final image of earth thrum offers resonant answer, reweighting "silence meant absence" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in thermal/vibrational bias; rhythmic prose modulates from hushed entry to radiant dawn without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (ice "sang back"); minor overwriting in thermal metaphors doesn't obscure closure thrum, rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thermal emotion-mapping and silent tuning forks transforms post-collapse silence trope; risk in vibrational music inevitability heightens stakes organically.</comment>
