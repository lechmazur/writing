<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied scars as fault lines mining raw language; contradictory fear ("I'm afraid. And that's why I stay") acts in scene, earning the final letter-writing renunciation with visible emotional cost. Gently skilled hands reveal values hierarchy without safety-hedging. Flawless single-POV coherence elevates to 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: reflective density builds from letters to his own, yielding Charged Poise RR closure when "box lighter now, as if its fractures had let some of the burden breathe"—cost legible in surrendered sorrow. Single continuous scene oriented by para 1; no waivers needed. One tightening via path's bend suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moss-cushioned boulder and frost-dusted needles constrain sitting/reading choices tactilely; ridge path as "altar" charges final letter tuck. Celestial bodies mirror internal slow dance, filtering through firefighter bias (timber knees). Recurrent box/prop integrates as micro-setting, enabling 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bargain innocence via pain translation) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through echoed losses to letter's trade-off (burden lightened at cost of exposure). Endurance agency forecloses burying path; cost felt in "vow to carry rather than bury." Minor abstractness in stakes prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of untranslated pain turning toxic emerges implicitly from replies/images, reweighted non-literally by final exhaling "warmth into the night"—resonant answer without moral. Box/letters recur to constrain, charging CR; no sermonizing. 9+ via particulars inextricable from arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with perceptual signature (ember-kisses, timber knees) biased to firefighting losses; rhythmic lyricism modulates softly under reflective pressure, prose as character. Purposeful elision of dialogue fits solitary scene. Clean free indirect without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "cracked porcelain box... nestled like a sleeping bird" advances prop/emotion); rhythm varies read-aloud. Dense figuratives ("fault lines where grief had settled") risk minor muddle but pattern-taught as alchemy motif, no loops/scaffold. "Gently skilled" repeat tugs slightly from perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: firefighter's reliquary ritual transforms trauma tropes via porcelain fragility/letter seeds, inevitable in hindsight. Risky hard-soft lyricism heightens resonance without gimmick; box-path-celestial cohere singularly. 9+ via non-obvious premise commitment.</comment>
