<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bracken's motivation to resurrect voices via the leaf roots consistently in handler's loss and intensifies through cylinder discoveries, compelling the expedition and archive role; contradictory impulses emerge in reluctant sanctuary vs. action. Interiority embodied in nose-twitching scents and paw-shadow truths. Final endurance as keeper earned with felt past-cost echo in dreams.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cylinder whispers to bunker cache, reconfiguring isolation into resonance (RR/Charged Poise). Orientation anchored in first paragraph (scrapyard, post-war). Closure costs legible in "dreamed not of ravines or smoke, but of forests whispering," foreclosing body-hunting past.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Scrapyard details (tank hulls, circuit-board stoves) constrain via hand-cranked dynamo and integrate into action (candlelight decoding). Recurring leaf charges final image under paw. Sensory hierarchy (ozone ghosts, shellac scent) reflects hound's bias, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distance to closeness) signaled early via leaf, tightens accumulatively at handler's voice ("physical blow"), narrowing to archive role. Agency in gathering scavengers and decoding forecloses wandering with communal cost felt in "nights decoding." One deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of echoes bridging absence emerges via cylinder voices and leaf-tints, reweighting isolation without statement; final "settlement thrived on resonance" answers non-literally. Subtext in "truth wears many skins" lingers ambiguously. Protagonist arc inextricable from resurrection question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in hound-biased noticing (scent of shellac, sideways gaze); rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive hush to revelation intensity. Stable third-limited POV, no leakage. Veyra's whisper natural, goal-subtle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "needle trembling as it kissed the groove" advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud. Heavy figuration purposeful in poetic voice but borders overwrite in revelation beats ("amber/violet/emerald"), slightly dulling peak propulsion—no loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hound-decoder, wax-leaf oracles, groove-texts transforms post-apoc tropes; phonograph bunker as voice-archive inevitable from particulars. Risky lyric accumulation heightens resonance without gimmick.</comment>
