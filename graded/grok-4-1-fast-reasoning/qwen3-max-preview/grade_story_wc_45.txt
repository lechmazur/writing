<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's shrewd innocence and pity-driven ritual embody contradictory impulses acting in scene, earning the final recognition smile without epiphany dumps; micro-choices like pressing thumbs into soil reveal values hierarchy with ongoing cleft cost. Minor abstract labels ("quiet architecture of redemption") don't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from placement to glow to pulsing tooth as RR/CR, reweighting betrayal into sacred potential with legible conceptual cost in the breathing cleft; single scene oriented by ~50 words, no gate fails.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden's paradoxes (roses/thistles, backward clocks, cinnamon/ozone) filter through POV urgency, constraining ritual and charging final maze rustle/pulsing image; recurring damp soil/hedges evolve tactilely, mirroring internal repair.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recomposing past) signaled early, deepens texturally via stirring vines/glow into Charged Poise where cleft endures as threshold cost; agency in murmuring/pressing narrows to hopeful stasis without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of redemption emerges from bone-setting particulars, final tooth-pulse image resonantly reweights changeling myth without moral; ambiguity in "almost mine" arms lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (e.g., "syllables that tasted of salt and honey") modulates rhythmically with ritual intensity; stable close-third POV biases toward repair, pattern-taught elision legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax/rhythm, metaphors (e.g., "shards of moonlight") pattern-taught without muddle; no loops, zero scaffold, closure image crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh changeling inversion via forgiveness/bone-setting transforms folklore organically; bold lyric risks heighten stakes in recomposed myths, inevitable in hindsight pulsing heart.</comment>
