<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Historian's motivation to collect wall-stories drives micro-choices like probing the hearthstone and palm on wall, earning her shift to active weaving; sensitively perceptive trait embodies without labels, shown in hands sensing trembling pages. Internal endurance of entropy's gnaw shows contradiction between refusal to let memory rot and the world's limp. Final smile forecloses passive collection with conceptual cost of descending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries density-build from diaries to tapestry match to wall-whispers, tightening to CR closure where "she would learn to weave... world might remember how to stand upright" reconfigures stake with cost of underlibrary descent. Orientation anchors in first paragraph (silo library, post-dream world). No shards/transitions; single scene coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silo walls constrain (lean closer, hum memory) and charge final image (smile back); selective sensory (fingertips brush spines, ash clings like regret, palm hums) filters through POV's perceptual bias. Hearthstone slab and worktable guide probing action; post-dream decay mirrors internal refusal without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend displaced axis via stories) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via diary-tapestry cross-ref that deepens to wall-hearing, narrowing to weaving decision; agency in transcribing forces trade-off of passive collection for risky descent. Cost legible in "gravity still stutters and clocks forget"; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of stories realigning causality emerges via particulars (diary's "displaced axis," dragons mending rifts); final image ("walls smiled back," dragons glow with meaning) offers non-literal resonance reweighting premise without moral. Subtext in whispers (lullaby, sob) layers memory's agency organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature (bookshelves whisper, pages tremble); rhythmic control modulates from shadowy glide to breath-caught intensity, prose syntax reflecting quest-mind. No dialogue/POV slips; elisions (her name dissolved) taught early, paid in purpose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "three diaries, their covers charred into abstract landscapes, their spines split open like ribs after autopsy" advances discovery+image); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops/scaffold. Minor figurative density in peak (silence grew teeth, axis slips) purposeful under textural lens, no muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-dream silo as living archive where walls store causality-wounds mended by story-weaving transforms tropes (forgotten lore, dragons); risk in existential "displaced axis" heightens stakes organically, inevitable hindsight from diary-thread to loom-descent.</comment>
