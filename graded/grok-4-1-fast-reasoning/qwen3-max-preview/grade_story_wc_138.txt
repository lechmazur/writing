<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (ennui vs. reverence for endings) act in scene through alignment choice and step forward; final wonder earned by immortality's toll on awe, visible in "sandpapered awe into ennui" priming the pulse felt at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of textures (thrum to mutiny to murmurs) culminates in Charged Poise closure with cost (escondite collapses into indigo point); orientation anchored early in prismatic escondite and storm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite and storm constrain method (magnetic alignment) and charge final plain; body filters (fingertip hum, marrow resonance) evolve causally with mutiny, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (post-goodbye discovery) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening (whispers to pulse) driven by agency (alignment, step); cost unmistakable in sanctuary's collapse and unknown plain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of endings' resonance emerges organically from goodbye whispers shifting to "quiet thunder of endings, hushed and holy"; final image reweights ennui-to-wonder arc without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (prismatic, cosmic diction like "shadows peeled... like liquid ink") modulates with intensity; stable single POV biases to spatial wonders, rhythmic control heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (syntax varies from fragments to swells matching mutiny); figurative pattern (light/space motifs) taught early, coherent without muddle in peak "spatial mutiny" beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny and goodbye-plain synthesize immortality trope freshly; risk in unweaving reality heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from amulet's helix to kneeling pulse.</comment>
