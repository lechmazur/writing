<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's watchfully calm trait enables empirical micro-choices under pressure, like placing the lantern and murmuring "Show me," revealing contradictory impulses (calm observation vs. tight throat); final endurance as witness is earned with visible cost of dismissed report.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of whispers, images, and realizations tightens to Charged Poise closure in final heartbeat-sync image; cost legible in "Her report will be dismissed... the tunnel remembers," foreclosing bureaucratic acceptance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tunnel and lantern constrain choices (e.g., kneeling where body fell aligns footprints) and charge final image (lantern pulses in pocket); sensory details like "damp and diesel residue" filter through empirical POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to uncover memory rupture escalates accumulatively from whispers to cascading images, forcing agency in leaving lantern; one deepening reweights options with cost of ignored findings charging steadiness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. amnesia emerges organically from particulars like 1852 shoeprint aligning with worker's; final walking-home image offers resonant answer, reweighting progress as entangled without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in empirical yet haunted noticing (e.g., "data wrapped in sorrow"); rhythmic control modulates from calm tunnel breaths to pulsing heartbeat, stable close-third POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors like "shadows stretch like reaching fingers" taught early and paying off in clarity; no loops, varied rhythm propels to charged final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story as "memory-field surge" via empirical investigator transforms tropes; risk in lantern's Underground Railroad tie heightens stakes to conceptual cost of city amnesia.</comment>
