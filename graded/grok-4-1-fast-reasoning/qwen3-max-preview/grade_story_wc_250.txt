<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Guardian's motivation rooted in memory of boy fuels present weaving with embodied calm; micro-choices like tracing wood and nudging shutters reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Internal endurance earned via flashback anchoring without contradiction. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in climax beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to drowned woman's approach and glyph-weaving, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) as she smiles/sinks gently with unbroken star piercing canal—cost legible in cradled descent and guardian's nod. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene coherent. Persistent constraint of light/shadows shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, canal, shutters constrain choices (angling mirror under surface, nudging grates for glyphs); recurring mirror charges closure via captured gleam. Sensory hierarchy (visual glimmers, whispers) filtered through guardian's ink-stained perception. Final star into canal recharges rain-slick planks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guiding lost via glyphs) signaled early, tightens accumulatively in faster weaving/touch, forcing renunciation of despair with felt cost in woman's gentle sink. Agency via mirror/shutter micro-choices; pressure coheres without reversal overload. Climax interaction legibly forecloses drowning-without-wonder path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (darkness values stars via hope's geometry) emerges organically from glyphs, mirror gleams, boy memory; subtext in silence and touch. Final star image offers resonant CR repricing canal's hunger without moralizing. Particulars like triple spiral avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (light fragments, spirals); voice texture poetic/lyric, modulating rhythm from whisper-calm to faster clicks. Patterned diction taught early pays off in charged poise. No head-hopping; elision purposeful for mystery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers, long and ink-stained, traced the damp wood grain"); rhythmic variety in short clicks/long descriptions. Figurative density borders overwriting in opening (drowned sapphire, bruised clouds) but coherent/voice-motivated; no loops or scaffolds dull closure. Minor register elevation fits mythic tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dental mirror from child's box weaves soul-glyphs via shutters against canal hunger; transforms guardian trope into light-sculptor. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes; final unbroken star inevitable from particulars. No derivative echoes.</comment>
