<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lior's contradictory hesitation before mist-step and final renunciation of grandeur earn his shift to simple charms, with embodied awe ("shivering not from cold but awe") revealing traits under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as keystone unstrap builds density to CR closure in weeping recognition ("He’d spent his life chasing grandeur when grace lived in crooked runes"), with cost of past failures legible in final palms' warmth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Recurrent lingering luminance constrains mist path ("woven from the same lingering luminance") and charges tree's glowing fruit/doors, mirroring Lior's internal thaw through purposeful sensory selection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Internal stake of failure tightens via mist-hesitation reversal, driving agency to keystone placement; accumulative pressure culminates in reconfiguration with visible cost of leaving stone behind.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tree's radiant doors to "sacred moments, all of them simple" reweights automated vs. remembered wonder non-literally, emerging organically from Lior's arc without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (noticing keystone pulse matching heartbeat) and rhythmic modulation sustain lyric texture through pressure, dialogue sparse but subtextual ("That’s why you’re here").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density propels via varied rhythm; peak metaphors like "magic should taste like laughter or grief" integrate without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cloud-tree blooming memory doors transforms failed-mage trope via keystone's wonder-memory synthesis, risking lyric payoff that heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
