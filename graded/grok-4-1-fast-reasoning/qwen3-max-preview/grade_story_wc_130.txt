<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via glass eyes calibrating grief's gaze; micro-choices like aligning eyes with tesserae reveal inventive traits under pressure. Earned reconfiguration from seeking coordinates to embracing transformation, with tears as embodied cost. Minor slip in over-articulated epiphanies like "silence wasn’t emptiness. It was resonance," but doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup to pattern break (orchard hum, equation projection, fruit fall); orientation anchored early in cavern orchard. CR closure lands cleanly with conceptual cost in reframing loss as transformation, charged by final fruit as compass. Persistent constraint of lunar angle shapes revelation without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cavern orchard, stalactites, mosaic constrain choices (eyes aligned on stone for projection, tree bark etched with derivations). Sensory details (drips as metronomes, bioluminescent pulse) filter through conjurer's priorities, mirroring internal symmetries. Final tree shudder and fruit charge closure image indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map loss via emotion's math) signaled early, deepens texturally through orchard responses to her integrals/hum, narrowing to new theorem. Agency in inventive acts provokes reversal (silence to resonance); cost felt in tears refracting coordinates. One tightening suffices, reweighting options visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformative loss emerges organically from particulars like glass-eye projection revealing Aris's equation. Final image (fruit compass, orchard exhaling) offers resonant CR answer without moralizing, reweighting absence as composition. Subtext in glow-moths brushing cheeks layers ambiguity beautifully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single 3rd POV, perceptual signature inventive (cracks as variables, integrals into lullabies). Rhythmic control modulates from contemplative to startled laugh, heightening resonance. Purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged poise at tree.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "droplets from stalactites struck mossy earth like metronomes"); rhythm varies naturally. Minor figurative density borders overwriting in opening but pattern-taught as lyric mode, no loops dulling closure. Propulsion clear to final wink.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math-emotion via bioluminescent orchard, glass eyes, dovetailed lullabies transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes through cavern's responses; equation reveal inevitable in hindsight, no hedging.</comment>
