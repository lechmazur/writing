<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via sensory embodiment (rag warmth, tile thrums in molars) and micro-choices under pressure (grit-dance sequence); final laugh/untie earned by prior chant-syncing causality with visible talisman cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build in steps/resonance to Charged Poise closure (mosaic eruption, star holds); cost legible in rag dissolution on central tile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Blooming fortress micro-setting (petal halos, silence spaces) constrains pathfinding/sequence and charges final seal; POV-filtered sensory hierarchy (phosphorescent dust, ozone silence) mirrors defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy hopelessness via mosaic) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through step-tightening that narrows to sonic peak; agency in boot-strikes forecloses with rag forfeiture cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of light-reclamation emerges from particulars (combustion ghosts to star match); final image reconfigures darkness premise non-literally with joy's audacity, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (ambient filtering, combustion idiom); rhythmic modulation builds to peak compression in step-beats without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (blooming fuses, sonic chords) propels via varied syntax/rhythm; minor overwrite density in opening procession (−0.4) but closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pyrotechnic pilgrimage in defiant flora-world; mosaic cipher and rag absorption turn familiar tropes (dark night, lost light) via irreplaceable fireworks logic.</comment>
