<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular in "serene anger—not rage, not despair, but a quiet, molten fury," driving micro-choices like deliberate ink spill; final disappearance earned by prior causality with embodied cost in synaptic plunge. Contradictory impulses (fury vs. serenity) act simultaneously, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via ink patterns and held; orientation anchored by ~50 words in encampment post-eclipse; CR closure lands on-page in disappearance with conceptual cost ("stepped into the ink’s final pattern, the one that doesn’t return"). Persistent ink constraint shapes tactics to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wind-carved encampment and ink constrain choices (gust funnels, wind stills at disappearance), charging final image; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (time anomalies over threats). Micro-setting (spilled ink veins) mirrors internal states through action, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why time slows) signaled early, escalates via ink spill revelation narrowing to self-application; agency in "spilled a droplet... by design," driving CR under accumulative lens with unmistakable cost (form dissolving). 9+ test met by protagonist-driven deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (time slows for witness's vanishing choice) emerges organically from ink mirroring "neural collapse," reweighting premise in final image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer fulfills 9+ test. Subtext in drone's calculation vs. her expansion enriches ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (fractals, vanishing tides); rhythmic control heightens pressure in "seconds thicken like honey," fulfilling 9+ test. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "ink shimmered... then vanished seconds later"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts dulling closure; minor figurative density in fractals purposeful, not muddling peak disappearance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neural time dilation via ink unravels into disappearance choice; risk-taking in CR heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight (+0.3 for bold premise). No derivative echoes, fully committed vision.</comment>
