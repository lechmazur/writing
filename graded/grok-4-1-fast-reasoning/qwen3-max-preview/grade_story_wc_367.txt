<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong mythic interiority and consistent motivation to shape dawn from shadows, embodied in lantern rituals; accidentally prophetic trait particularized through offhand effects like chuckles birthing omens. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or micro-choices under stress, rendering endurance more declarative than tested. Flaws feel archetypal rather than complicating specific decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from routine to urgent stars and inverted shadow flare, yielding Charged Poise closure in "shadow stretched long... as invitation" with eternal vigilance cost legible. Single scene anchored early (lighthouse, night, herald). No orientation debt; one tightening via pulsing stars narrows to prophetic glimpse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emerald lighthouse, salt-slick cliffs, jade stairs vividly constrain routine and charge final image; sensory hierarchy (auroras humming, storm curling) reflects herald's priorities. Setting evolves with flare and dimming; fisherman glimpse grounds without diluting. Micro-setting (lantern wick) shapes reflection pivotal to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (steering dreaming edge) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via stars' urgency and lantern's shadow illumination, forcing prophetic stance crystallization. Agency in raising wick and murmuring "catalyst" forecloses chaos path with felt eternal cost. Pressure coheres texturally to Charged Poise without reversal mandate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of light-draped-in-dark (stories from salt/shadow) emerges organically from visions of coral libraries and ink sacrament, reweighted in final "dawns shaped by ancient hands." No moralizing; resonance from particulars like fisherman's dreams avoids platitudes. Protagonist arc inextricable from mythic renewal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature: fractured soul bends fate's light, modulating rhythm from wind-chime laughter to velvet dark. Prose texture distinct in syntax (paradox whispers, inverted shadow); no head-hopping or withholding. Voice as character: prophetic idiom biases noticing to omens and thresholds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but figurative overload in reflection beat ("silver needles stitching," "darkness that illuminated") borders coherence strain without full pattern payoff, docking from peak. Minimal loops; strong verbs anchor images. Closure image clear despite lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of herald's prism-soul steering post-newspaper myth-hunger via lantern oracle; tropes (prophet, storm-weaver) transformed through accidentally prophetic routine. Risky lyric poise heightens stakes; "total internal reflection" inflection inevitable in hindsight, no derivatives.</comment>
