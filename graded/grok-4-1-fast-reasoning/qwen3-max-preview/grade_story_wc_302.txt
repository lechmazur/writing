<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied sensations (watch pulsing warm, glyphs blooming on skin) and micro-choices under pressure (reaching negative space despite risks); cautious exuberance shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. Final realization earned by recursive discoveries with conceptual cost of becoming the archive. Minor slip: less explicit internal conflict beyond tone, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught early (cyclically reversed stacks, propagation delays) holds to CR closure: mirror revelation reconfigures premise as eternal loop with undeniable conceptual cost ("She became the archive"). Orientation anchored by ~100 words; pattern density tightens recursively without breaks. No slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting (glowing library in mist) vividly sensory and purposeful (mist coils into sentences, shelves rearrange causally); recurring bone stylus constrains documenting choices and charges final mirror glyph. Micro-setting (watch, glyphs) alters tactics (ripples rewrite path). Final archway and mirror evolution mirrors internal recursion perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find unspoken words archive) signaled early; textural escalation via deepening density (discoveries ripple back, rearranging prior steps) driven by agency (searching, documenting). One decisive tightening at "Apologies Swallowed Whole" scent/memory narrows to inner sanctum with felt cost; closure crystallizes loop pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of recursive unspoken truths emerges organically from particulars (glyph-shadows of regrets, library loop); final mirror image offers resonant CR ("each wearing her face") reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and ciphers invites ambiguity with emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (mist as "grammatical structures," footfalls "echo before made"); POV stable/single, rhythmic modulation heightens surreal texture under pressure. Compression/elision pattern-taught early, legible at recursive closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "mist thickened into sentences"); rhythm varies, no loops/artifacts, figurative language consistent (shelves as "vertebrae") without muddle in peaks. Final line ("ready to unfold the cipher all over again") recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Surreal recursion (seekers as architects of own loop) fresh synthesis; bold risks (nonlinear delays, self-becoming archive) heighten stakes organically. Transformation test passes: core premise/turns inevitable from established rules, no derivatives.</comment>
