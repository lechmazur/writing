<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and micro-choices like dropping the stone reveal a consistent, particular motivation rooted in attentiveness, with embodied age (knees protesting) adding cost to endurance. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for deeper conflict. Earned stasis in carrying reckonings aligns with prior observations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup to stone-drop intensification, fading rings to final carrying of reckonings as compass points (CR/Charged Poise). Legible cost in physical rising and world's shift. Single scene, orientation anchored early (pier, dawn), closure reconfigures seeing with felt opportunity price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (mist gradients, prism glow on rings) filtered through glazier's bias for light/flaws constrain the ritual and charge final mist-fraying image. Micro-setting (tide pool, stone) evolves causally, mirroring internal alignment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminate mundane via ritual) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through stone rings' patterns to clarity, narrowing to endurance amid ordinary wake. Agency in attentive listening/drop forecloses ignorance with physical/emotional cost (knees, fleeting liminal). Subtle but coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of consecrating mundane emerges organically from particulars (prism, rings, widow's window), final image ("world was never just what it seemed... between the lines") offers resonant CR without moralizing. Complexity lingers in choice to see amid ordinary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (refractions, patterns in flaws/ripples). Lyrical rhythm modulates purposefully, prose as character in glazier's attuned syntax; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propel accumulatively without loops or scaffolds; metaphors (spectral shards on rings) integrate purposefully in peak beat without muddle. Propulsion peaks at stone drop, breathes in reflective close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glazier-as-seer transforms mundane dawn ritual into luminous CR via ripple physics and light patterns. Risky lyric poise on observation heightens stakes of attentiveness without gimmick.</comment>
