<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scholar's reticence creates embodied tension resolved in the pivotal vocal answer ("I don’t know"), earning a credible shift with felt cost of abandoning transcription; contradictory impulses between listening and speaking act in the final beat. Interiority particular via glyphs and dust motes, no stock phrasing. Flaws like weathered innocence drive the renunciation without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of resonances builds to crystal's clearer chime and question as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting premise with cost in her untranscribed answer and notebook closure. Single scene anchored early (library, dawn, crystal by ~50 words), no orientation debt. One tightening via anomalous echo narrows to voice response.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Shadowed library and crystal constrain choices (striking fork, recording echoes) and charge final image (syllables spiraling, notebook closed); sensory hierarchy (sonic bends, dust motes) reflects scholar's priorities. Details evolve causally (dawn creeps), integrated into action without stalls. Micro-setting via crystal/taper mirrors internal hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding growth patterns) signaled early, tightens via crystal's question forcing agency in whispered answer/closure, foreclosing transcription path under Accumulative lens with legible cost (trembling voice, smile of acceptance). Pressure coheres in escalating resonances; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of pattern in entropy emerges via crystal echoes and final CR ("that is where growth begins"), reweighting decay-to-growth without moralizing; resonant image of tangled syllables answers "What grows now?" organically. Complexity in ambiguity lingers via pause-syntax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (rhythm of vanished hands, glyphs of pressure) biases noticing; stable single-POV with poetic rhythm modulating to thin voice at peak. Compression taught early via method, paid in closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture/pressure, no loops or scaffolds; figurative language purposeful (ripples, origami breath) without muddle in peak (crystal chime). Rhythmic variety peaks in closure image; zero artifacts dulling final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic archaeology transforms decay trope via crystal diagnostics; risk in lyric method heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight via anomalous question. Bold conceptual frame (building utterances) commits fully without retreat.</comment>
