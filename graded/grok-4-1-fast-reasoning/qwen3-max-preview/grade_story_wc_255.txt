<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's texture-bound perception ("damp velvet of moss") generates contradictory impulses toward broken beauty, earning the mutual shift to kiln-awakening with soot-kneed cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds from reed discovery to dusk vibration ("low tone vibrated up through the soil"), landing Charged Poise RR in courtyard hum with ember-recognition cost legible in Marta's knees.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Courtyard's ash-patterns and cracked birdbath constrain arrangements and charge dew-filling image, evolving tactilely through POV's textural bias to mirror awakening pulse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to awaken imperfection tightens accumulatively via reed-to-shoots density, with Elias's agency in placements forcing Marta's soot-kneed participation and kiln commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Embers/cracks motif reconfigures perfection premise non-literally in "curling toward Marta’s arrangement like antennae," charging CR with undeniable cost of ruined beauty's pulse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature of resonances ("humming faintly when brushed by the breeze") holds stably through third-limited Elias, modulating rhythm under dusk pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"The rosemary twitched. The ivy uncurled an extra inch. The cracked birdbath filled" delivers zero-loop density and propulsion, with coherent metaphors untouched at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plant-language synthesis via colorblind textures transforms phoenix aftermath into resonant salvage, risking lyric fantasy where reed's off-note inevitability heightens stakes organically.</comment>
