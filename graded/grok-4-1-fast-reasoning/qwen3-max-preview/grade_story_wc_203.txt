<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Technician's observant trait and discovery motivation propel micro-choices like using the barrel and whispering "I see you," earning the witnessing closure with embodied cost in dust on collar and inner burden; minor telling of motivation slightly abstracts interior drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dust disturbances layer to spiral patterns, drawing reveal, and ghost silhouette, delivering Charged Poise closure in "The air stilled" with conceptual cost of ongoing responsibility; orientation anchored early, one tightening via ceiling discovery suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mainspring barrel as micro-setting constrains reveals (patterns under counter, ghost reflection) and charges final image; sensory details like popcorn/sawdust smell and dust curls filter through POV urgency, evolving causally without spatial slips.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of engaging ghosts escalates texturally from fleeing dust to swirled silhouette, forcing endurance choice ("I see you") that lightens ghosts but forecloses neglect with burden cost felt in evidence bag next to daughter's photo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing releasing haunted neglect emerges organically from drawing's "DADDY," ghost's reach, to final "building...keeping vigil," reweighting abandonment without moralizing; resonant image answers central question of ghosts haunting neglect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing (dust curls as fleeing children) sustains tight third-limited POV; rhythmic modulation peaks in whisper beat, with purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and read-aloud rhythm, e.g., "dust rained onto his collar" embeds action; no loops or artifacts, purposeful metaphors like "sigh woven into...timber" cohere without muddling peak ghost reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ghost-hunting via dust science and repair tools transforms supernatural trope organically; fresh synthesis in "ghosts don’t haunt places; they haunt neglect" inevitability heightens stakes, with risk-taking in textural closure paying off legibly.</comment>
