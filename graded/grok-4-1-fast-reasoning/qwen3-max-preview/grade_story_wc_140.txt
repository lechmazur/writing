<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve textures through consistent, embodied micro-choices like sitting by the child's shoe for three tides reveals interior contradiction between isolation and compulsion, earning his endurance at closure without epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from fragments to dioramas, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure in "He would keep collecting... until the world admitted he’d never died," reweighting erasure with endless persistence cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Port's shipping containers and tides constrain choices (high tide forces upward, low reveals whispers), charging final dawn climb; selective sensory grit (rust, salt, stains) mirrors Elias's textural filter without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of textural preservation escalates accumulatively via deepening vignettes (poison label to shoe), narrowing to endurance with legible isolation cost; child's shoe beat forces micro-renunciation of direct intervention.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Erased histories theme emerges organically from layered particulars (label, shoe, murmurs), resonant non-literal answer in final persistence image reweighting bureaucratic finality without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (reality as "layered... hidden frequencies") modulates rhythmically; stable close third-person POV filters port through Elias's textural bias, compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (e.g., "fragments... like sediment") propels via varied syntax, though minor metaphor density in mid-vignettes slightly risks overwriting without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh bureaucratic-undead premise transformed via textural scavenging (whispers as contraband), bold lyric accumulation risks bold synthesis of erasure motif into charged poise without gimmickry.</comment>
