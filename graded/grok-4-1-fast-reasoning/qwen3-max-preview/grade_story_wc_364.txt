<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Arlo's meekness and quiet determination root clear motivation to share magic, embodied in daily descents and tool infusions; final internalization feels earned via prior persistence. Internal conflict leans summarized over simultaneous impulses in scene, but micro-choices like tracing glyphs reveal values under pressure. Child interaction adds relational crucible without diluting focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silk's thinning and glyph pulses builds to Charged Poise CR where Arlo becomes the barter, with legible cost in silk's depletion ("thinned with each barter"). Orientation anchors early (Arlo, mine/orchard, mornings/seasons). Single-shard narrative with purposeful reflection interleaving present actions; no lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating rock arches and mine shafts vividly constrain choices (daily descents, glyph tracing) and charge final image (arches humming with returned magic). Sensory details (hum, pulse, creak) filter through Arlo's priorities, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of silk and tools integrates tactilely into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax resilience before silk ends) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via thinning silk and final glyph press narrowing options. Agency in deliberate sharing forces trade-off, with cost visible in last silk piece used. Escalation coheres under lens without reversal overload; child's scythe anecdote deepens stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of quiet awakening emerges organically from silk-to-self arc, reweighted in final image ("He had become the barter") without moralizing. Recurring glyphs/resonance motif shifts from confusion to clarity, charging closure. Complexity embraces meekness as strength with no tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (marrow call, glyph heartbeats); voice modulates lyrically with intensity. Minimal dialogue natural, subtextual ("the door won’t stick when you need to run"). Rhythmic prose biased to Arlo's deliberate pace; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric rhythm; metaphors cohere (silk as "liquid twilight"). Minor paraphrase loops in reflection ("magic never did when shared") but don't obscure closure. Varied syntax propels accumulatively; opening anchors stakes, final line recharges motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mundane forging and bartered magic transforms fantasy tropes via silk-infusion specificity. Risky lyric accumulation heightens quiet stakes organically; orchard/mine paradox feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; bold premise commits fully.</comment>
