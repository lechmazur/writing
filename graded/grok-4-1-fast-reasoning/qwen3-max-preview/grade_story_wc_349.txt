<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vendor's motivation to unwrite herself drives consistent micro-choices like incising the counter and ledger entries; interiority concrete in quantifying regrets (e.g., "3.7 heartbeats"). Embodied emotion in trembling fingers and lighter feeling post-sales. Minor flaw: past roles summarized without scene-tilting cost, but endurance earns closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sales/incisions build density to Charged Poise closure where distributed voids lighten vendor conceptually. Orientation anchored early in library on clouds/first day. Cost legible in final ledger left open, reconfiguring beginnings via absence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass orchard library vividly selective (crystalline branches, ozone/unread epilogues); countertop incisions recur to constrain ritual/charge glimmers dancing overhead. Mirrors voids internally; body (fingers on counter) shapes actions. Final cart-packing evolves setting causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distribute personal void) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via seven incisions tightening to lighter burden. Agency in endurance/sales; cost felt in shared hollows foreclosing solo erasure. No reversal needed; density reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings via quantified absence emerges organically from ledger ("Absence measured") and sales; final image ("ledger open") reconfigures premise non-literally with conceptual cost of unlived stories. Subtext in implications/silences; no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (measuring hollows); lyrical rhythm modulates (short sales beats vs. reflective ledger). Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("quantifying absence"); diction biased to voids/light. No head-hopping; compression purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., incisions gleam and reveal unlived paths); rhythm varies read-aloud. Purposeful figuratives (prismatic shards) taught early, payoff in ceiling dances; minor density slip in opening metaphors but no loops or muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: vendor brokering erasures in fantastical library transforms "clean slate" trope via quantified voids/glimmering parole. Risky lyric fragmentation heightens stakes; ledger's arithmetic ghosts inevitable in hindsight, no derivatives.</comment>
