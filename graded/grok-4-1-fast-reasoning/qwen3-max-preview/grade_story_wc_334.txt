<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chronically curious trait embodied in "boots-muddy, notebook-stained" actions and hunch-driven placement of mushroom; final smile crystallizes endurance of curiosity over recovery, with contradictory impulses (leave vs. stay) acting in the closing beat, earned by investigative causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup to cadence shift; Charged Poise closure in "She could leave—or stay. She smiled," reconfigures curiosity as sustaining habit with felt cost of yielding remaining memories; orientation anchored in opening lines, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse's distorted skylight constrains pivotal mushroom placement and charges final image; sensory details (brine-damp cap, refracted rainbows, seeping scents) selectively mirror internal vacancy and integrate via goal-directed actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory recovery) signaled early, deepens via hunch and pulse to binary choice narrowing options; protagonist agency in theorizing and experimenting forces stance crystallization under Accumulative lens, with legible cost in foreclosed "leave and warn" path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity as rupture-feeding habit emerges organically from orchard mechanics and folklorist's arc; final image non-literally answers "recover or surrender?" by reweighting prior fragments (rosewater, peaches) as Orchard's lure, with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature of folkloric-scientific fusion ("equations scribbled beside pressed petals"); rhythmic modulation heightens under pressure, diction biased toward thresholds and hungers without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("Memories didn’t flood back—they seeped"); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, but minor figurative density ("cathedral of lost seasons") in setup risks slight overwriting without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stellar aberrations mapping memory theft via habit ruptures transforms fairy lore into causal system; risk-taking in undersea orchard premise heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via "chronically curious hunch."</comment>
