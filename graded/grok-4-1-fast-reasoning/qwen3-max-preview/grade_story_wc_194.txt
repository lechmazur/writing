<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority ("bones as tuning forks") and earned pivot from destroyer to restorer, with micro-choices like precise needle alignment revealing hunter-like poise; subtle contradictory impulses in "What if...?" musings act in scene, compelling the final walk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to CR closure ("She was... its restoration") with conceptual cost legible in pivoting mission; orientation anchored early ("sepia reading room"), no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sepia room and gramophone constrain choices (resonator translates frequencies) and charge final image (warm crank as "relic"); selective sensory hierarchy (vibrations over visuals) mirrors intuitive stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover truth) signaled early tightens via intuitive method to knowledge-deepening revelation, narrowing "destroyer" path with felt personal cost; agency in crank turns drives under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silent truths humming emerges organically from cylinder pulses to final reconfiguration, reweighting political mission personally without moralizing; resonant non-literal close ("coronation of understanding") answers premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (vibrations as "standing waves"); rhythmic texture modulates to shimmer at crank turns, purposeful poetic compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Overwriting in peak revelation ("bridge of intuition—a living lattice") mixes metaphors and densifies figuratives without payoff, dulling propulsion; paraphrase loops like repeated crank brushes (−0.6); strong rhythm elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gramophone as emotional resonator and wave-trained intuition transforms dynasty trope; risk-taking voice heightens personal stakes, inevitable in hindsight via cylinder voice recognition.</comment>
