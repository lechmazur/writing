<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in duty-bound remembrance versus personal grief, embodied in trembling fingers and quiet weeping during naming; final shift to heart-carrier earned via ritual micro-choices. No safety-hedging in flawed endurance of sacrifice's echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from balcony unfolding to chamber crystallization, culminating in Charged Poise closure where pulsing page reconfigures grief with felt cost in his smile after centuries. Orientation anchored early at balcony/dusk; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shattered prism and dying sun constrain ritual choice, charging final crystallized page image; sensory selection (whispering cloak, frost-clung ribs) mirrors internal hollow via POV bias. Spatial choreography coherent across balcony-chamber moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crystallize grief) deepens accumulatively through naming beats, narrowing to endurance with visible cost in wept naming and foreclosed heartbreak. Agency in song/words forces stance crystallization under fading light pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of naming fears to share burden emerges organically via leviathan renaming; final "heart-carrier" image resonantly reweights sacrifice's echo without moralizing, inviting ambiguity in ongoing weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature of echo-haunted diction; rhythm modulates from regret-whisper to charged pulse, teaching poetic compression early for ritual payoff. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (e.g., short naming declarations amid long evocations); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors—figurative coherence peaks purposefully in "memory made manifest" crystallization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms reaper trope via atlas-naming ritual, risking mythic lyricism that heightens emotional stakes; "Elan, who remembers every sailor’s lullaby" turn inevitable from prior echoes, no hedging.</comment>
