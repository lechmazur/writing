<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cool-headedness embodied in unflinching match of feral pitch and focus on spike amid inversion; micro-choices like voicing silence reveal values hierarchy with spike's breakage as cost. Internal consistency drives endurance without contradiction. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sonic density builds from thrum to rupture, culminating in CR via echo's release and constellations' shift to purposeful orbit. Spike slam conducts DC with legible cost (spike cracks, garden folds). Orientation anchored early in garden; no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sonic thickets constrain zigzag navigation; rail spike as micro-setting tool charges final image via conduction and fracture. Sensory hierarchy (auditory over visual) reflects fisher's transliteration bias. Garden evolution (shudders, folds) mirrors pressure without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (echo hunt) signaled early, escalates via constellation pause and dissonance to spike slam tightening under Accumulative lens. Agency in backward humming forecloses capture for carrying, with garden wounds as cost. Protagonist alteration crystallizes stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grief-as-tide theme emerges from particulars like fossilized sigh and feral lullaby, reweighted in final gold shift without moralizing. Closing image offers non-literal answer: echoes carried, not captured. Resonance inextricable from fisher's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with sonic perceptual signature (phonemes, pitches); rhythmic modulation peaks in "Aaaaah" under inversion stress. Purposeful compression taught early via transliteration. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "exhaled slowly, carving hollows" advances action/atmosphere); sonic metaphors cohere without muddle. Rhythms vary for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in climax taught by pattern, no closure dulling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Surreal sonic synthesis (transliterates → voicing silence → spike conduction) feels inevitable; risk-taking in pattern-break inversion heightens stakes. Transformation of tropes (fishing echo, grieving stars) via lived acoustics. No derivatives; bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
