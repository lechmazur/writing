<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elio's embodied serenity amid thickening presences and gradient realizations shows contradictory impulses acting in the ritual; final whisper and bonsai touch earn closure with visible cost in redistributed weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as compass pulls and lace instructions build to diffusion; closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly when needle stills and leaves unfurl, with conceptual cost of non-erasure legible in "redistributed its weight."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Selective sensory details like "salt-laced wind combing through wet grass" and "shallow hollow beneath a wind-sculpted pine" constrain ritual spot choice and charge final juniper image; micro-setting via soil and pool evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of diffusing cerulean regret signaled early tightens accumulatively through needle stutter, ghostly sigh, and indigo bleed; agency in tracing lace forces trade-off, with cost felt in diffusion's "softening the edges" rather than erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of voiceless apologies emerges organically via gradients and final image of dawn-shade leaves; resonant non-literal answer reweights premise in "light seep into spaces once choked," embracing ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in silt-like rhythms and biased noticing (e.g., "cadence of withheld confessions"); purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at charged closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in purposeful figures like "blue as silence after a slammed door"; minor density overload in peak ritual (air thickens, color gradients) slightly dulls propulsion but pattern holds without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of remorse-compass, regret-color, and lace-ritual transforms tropes into inevitable organic whole; bold lyric risk in gradients and diffusion heightens stakes, fully committing to premise without retreat.</comment>
