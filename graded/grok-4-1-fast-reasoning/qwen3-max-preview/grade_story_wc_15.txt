<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via needle-scars as vows and embodied dust-tasting hymns; contradictory optimism defies guild rules, earning final rewrite of fate with ancestral cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density build in sewing beat; Charged Poise closure pulses plate and forges new path, with conceptual cost of mending cracks vs. erasure undeniable in "walls shimmered...memory made visible."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Labyrinth paths constrain sleepwalking choices; canyon exhales drowned echoes, charging final shimmering tapestries; selective senses (ghost salt, kelp fiber) mirror ruin-to-reverence without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to defy erasure tightens via labyrinth hum/plate warming, narrowing to rewrite vs. repeat precedents; agency in stitches drives deepening under accumulative lens, cost felt in "silence had grown too heavy."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mending ruin emerges implicitly via plate fractures honored as spine; final stars-as-loom reweights without moralizing, resonant answer to broken precedents.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (moon-pale intuition, dream-etched routes); rhythmic lyric voice modulates intensity, distinct texture in syntax suits haunting optimism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with propulsion in sewing ("each loop a whispered counter-spell"); figurative density high in peak but coherent/pattern-taught with closure payoff, minor metaphor pile-up in canyon exhales deducts lightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weaver sewing memory into stone/plate transforms ruin tropes; risk in lyric fantasy heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight via ancestral gravity to pulsing heart-plate.</comment>
