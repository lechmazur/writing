<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction via borrowed personalities splitting seams with understanding, embodied in typesetting under grief; final walk-away renunciation earned by erosion cost, no unmotivated epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to CR closure in final glyph ("beginning," "ending," "bridge") and halo placement, cost legible in unsolved mathematics; orientation anchored in opening lines, no waiver needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Halo fragment as micro-setting constrains choices (pressed to temple, pulses moods) and charges final image atop press; topaz panels refract equations into action, sensory hierarchy (ozone ink, starlight glyphs) POV-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map emotions) tightens via borrowed mad mathematician for final theorem, agency in deliberate typesetting forecloses isolation path; cost felt in halo dimming and name-loss, under Textural lens density reweights hunger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of emotion's geometry emerges organically from glyph-shifting and halo tests, final image offers non-literal resonance repricing empathy-space without moralizing; ambiguity lingers via multiple truths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mathematical metaphors ("slope of a sigh, integral of a sob") stable in third-limited POV; rhythmic modulation peaks in "groaned as it rolled, transferring not ink but intention," no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figuratives (e.g., "empathy as non-Euclidean space") taught early, no loops or scaffolds; minor metaphor density in peak typesetting beat contained by voice, propulsion clear to final sigh.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress mysticism and emotional calculus transforms tropes, halo as dimensional shard risks bold premise payoff in warlord anecdote and final walk; inevitable in hindsight, no hedging.</comment>
