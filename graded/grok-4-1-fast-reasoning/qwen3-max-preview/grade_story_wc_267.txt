<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bellhop's contradictory impulses—vowed silence versus frostbitten hope—embody in trembling hands and palm on stain, compelling bolt retrieval and note after child's eyes force micro-choice with trauma cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds routine density to child/whistle pattern break, tightening to piano note as Charged Poise RR with legible past-collapse cost; lens holds cleanly to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stain constrains daily ritual and charges final gold flush; piano/staircase as micro-settings guide choices and mirror thaw, with sensory selection (whispers, creaks) reflecting silent POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Safety-vs-music stake signaled early via bolt trauma, tightens agency-driven via child's arrival forcing whistle confrontation; note forecloses silence path with betrayal risk made visceral on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Silence-as-unpardonable-cost emerges organically from bolt/stain particulars, final hovering fingers offering resonant non-literal reweighting of premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward creaks/sighs/stain hues; lyrical diction ("frozen hymn") coheres with vowed silence, minimal dialogue purposeful in whisper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel climax ("note rang out—clear, warm, trembling"); minor overwrought metaphors early (e.g., "seraphically mundane") but peak clean, no loops/artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bolt as self-imposed linchpin transforms silence trope into trauma-specific redemption arc; fortress/stain synthesis feels inevitable, bold lyric risks heighten stakes without gimmick.</comment>
