<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through concrete embodiment like "lick their frozen cheeks, tasting salt and sorrow"; contradictory impulses in hollow waiting versus final patient offering of paw earn the change with visible cost. Dimensional homesickness roots consistent traits that compel higher-stakes micro-choices, like pressing pendant to forehead.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from swallowing garden to pendant's warming pulse, culminating in RR-Charged Poise when statue awakens ("A crack echoed—not of breaking, but of opening") with legible conceptual cost (homesickness transmutes, not vanishes). Orientation anchors early ("feral library guardian crouched beneath the frost-laced boughs"); single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen garden and mist constrain choices (coils ankles, thickens with pendant glow) and charge final image (mist curls into smile); sensory hierarchy via POV (glyphs taste like static/snow) mirrors internal states purposefully without overt symbolism. Statues evolve causally from terror-frozen to breathing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (homesickness/loneliness) signaled early tightens accumulatively via guardian's agency—interiorizing mist, placing pendant—forces stance crystallization; cost unmistakable in transmuted ache becoming compass ("No longer a wound, but a compass").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of befriending uncertainty emerges organically from particulars like pendant's "plea" and guardian recognizing cultist's loneliness; final image ("offered its paw... until fear became trust") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting isolation into porous connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("glyphs that tasted like static and snow") and rhythmic control modulate with pressure; stable third-limited POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in legible closure; single "Friend?" whisper natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/scaffold; metaphors coherent ("light has edges sharper than any blade—and softer than any sigh") propel without muddle; varied rhythm accelerates to connective cracks, breathes in reflective swallows.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library guardian with dimensional swallowing and foggy lucidity transforms exile tropes into emissary arc; risk-taking in lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight via pendant's shift from stolen thresholds to connective pulse.</comment>
