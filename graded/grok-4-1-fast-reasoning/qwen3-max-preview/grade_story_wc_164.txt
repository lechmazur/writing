<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in "giddy sorrow" and "cheerful gloom" act simultaneously; final renunciation of mourning for adornment earned via seed visions, with cost in wearing borrowed memories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from seeds to crater glass CR, reweighting loss as gift; cost legible in "wear the missing pieces as adornments, not wounds."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Geode cave constrains via crevices lodging seeds and embeds crater glass; charges final image as pendant humming with memories, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to discover path-loss deepens via visions into willing gift; agency in pressing glass forecloses mourning path, cost felt in joyful acceptance under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of loss-as-gift emerges from particulars like seeds-as-farewells; final "scattering conjectures like confetti" non-literally answers central question, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in emotion-as-wind/music; rhythmic control modulates from whispers to echoing laughter under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Purposeful figurative density taught early coheres in prismatic motifs without muddle; minor overwrite in descriptive clusters slightly dulls propulsion pre-climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotion-seeds and crater visions transforms loss trope; risk in lyric paradox heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in "paths disappear... so new ones can be sung."</comment>
