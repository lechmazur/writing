<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grasping the gear amid flooding memories and paradox embodies rebellion's internal conflict; "This was not redemption. This was rebellion" reveals neatly inventive motive under pressure with earned cost of isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal chain peaks in decisive gear lift surging radiance to unwriting disasters, with cost legible as "lighthouse groaned. Its stone face fissured" and stone dissolving; single tightening via mainspring holds lens to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hunger stone's glyphs and hollows constrain inventive dissection and insertions, charging climax bloom; salt spray, creaking stairs filter through POV urgency without generic tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to shatter predestination escalates via yoyo hum to mainspring tremor and memory flood, narrowing to gear grasp; "He gritted his teeth" shows agency amid causal pressure with visible structural cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Paradox realization "His gear. Or rather, the one he would forge tomorrow" reconfigures fate's premise non-literally, layering rebellion's triumph with solitude's conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with inventive perceptual signature ("dissecting the stone’s geometry, its hollows whispering") modulates rhythm through stress without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density propels via "air thickened... hum, low and tectonic" without loops or muddled metaphors; varied syntax accelerates to closure image unmarred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Yoyo as future-self blueprint transforms time-loop trope into inevitable rebellion, risking paradox payoff that heightens stakes organically.</comment>
