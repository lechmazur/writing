<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to thaw mistrust roots in eavesdropping-derived insight, compelling micro-choices like doodle contours and lens placement; embodied vulnerability peaks in unguarded smile after lens cracks, earning change with cost. Keepers' reactions reveal particular flaws under pressure without stereotypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from Elira's setup to light-drawing emergence, humming pattern break, and Charged Poise closure in child's hand and cracking lens with completion cost. Orientation anchors early in forecourt; one tightening via glow suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rain-slick mosaic and crystal columns constrain movement and amplify light's draw; recurring rain drip and pooling basins mirror internal thaw, charging final silver glow as forgiveness. Sensory hierarchy (visual refract, tactile wet stone) biases through Elira's perceptual intent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thaw mistrust) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via lens glow forcing emergence and humming reversal that crystallizes trust; agency in non-verbal exposure forecloses silence's shield with lens-crack cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of honesty freeing through ambiguity emerges in doodles' felt contours shifting under light, resonant in cracking lens and absorbed message; final image reweights prior tensions without moral, inviting complexity in vulnerability's risk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with Elira's perceptual signature in "emotional contours" and "resonant hush"; rhythmic diction modulates from hushed setup to vibrating marrow peak, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "lens caught the beam and threw it downward—not as an image, but as a trembling circle"); varied rhythm breathes with hush intensification, zero loops, coherent metaphors enhance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of projector lens projecting emotional transparency onto doodled tickets transforms silence trope; risk-taking in non-verbal thawing via humming and child touch heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
