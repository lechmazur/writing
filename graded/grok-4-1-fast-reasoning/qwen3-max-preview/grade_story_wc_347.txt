<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reluctant caretaker's resignation and arithmetic motivation compel subtle micro-choices like heel-drags and whistles, earning endurance with embodied weariness. Contradictory impulses (hate duty yet prevent ghosts) act in scene, revealed through precise actions under frost pressure. Final sigh back forecloses escape with felt cost of perpetual service. Girl's brief role adds crucible without diluting drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of whispers, birds, subtle guidance builds to Charged Poise RR closure where caretaker sighs amid feathering frost, reweighting resignation with cost of ongoing duty. Orientation anchored early (cliffside to orchard). Persistent constraint (labyrinth paths) shapes tactics; cost legible in "He didn’t look back. He never did."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cliffside shale, brass birds, silver sap constrain choices (safe paths, non-alarm subtlety); frost evolution pressures timing. Recurrent orchard sighs mirror internal state, charging final image where air sharpens with ice. Sensory hierarchy (crunching boots, dissolving whispers) reflects caretaker's annoyed precision. Micro-setting (nut grooves) enables tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent ghost via girl’s escape) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through method density and frost cadence shift narrowing options. Agency in renunciation of direct aid forecloses heroic path with cost of solo return. Protagonist endurance crystallizes stance; time pressure alters tactics visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of graceless duty emerges organically from particulars (nut blueprint, impressions), reweighted in final orchard sigh exchanging mutual ingratitude. Subtext in "Ground’s earned it" implies beauty in annoyed precision without moralizing. Final image answers resignation's cost non-literally, lingering ambiguity of chorus growth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature: whispers dissolving pre-meaning, ground-earned annoyance. Voice texture (offhand exactitude in syntax) modulates with frost urgency; dialogue subtextual ("You walk like you’re annoyed at the ground"). Rhythmic control heightens pressure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "dragged his heel just so across patches of moss" advances action, setting, character). Varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds; purposeful figures (sun bled, frost feathered) cohere. Zero artifacts dull closure; read-aloud cadence breathes with scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: nut-etched blueprint enables impressions-without-touching in bird-patrolled curse, transforming labyrinth trope via arithmetic resignation. Risky subtlety heightens stakes; final mutual sigh inevitable from particulars, no hedging. Non-obvious moral calculus (prevent chorus sans heroism) personalizes duty.</comment>
