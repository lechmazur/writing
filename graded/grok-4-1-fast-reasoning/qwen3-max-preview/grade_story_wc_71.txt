<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in noticing creeping normality, embodied in bare feet and chest warmth; micro-choices like placing the shard reveal values. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously for 9+ test; serene progression misses sharper internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from walk to hush deepening and shard's thrumming presence as Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost (shard dissolves but memory lingers). Orientation anchored early in bay walk; one tightening via house pulses suffices. Final image of unclenched cottage reconfigures options undeniably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (salt-kissed air, moss-slick stone) constrains placement on rock; bay mirrors internal hush, charging final shard glow. POV bias shapes noticing (house sighs). 9+ test met: setting enables sanctification ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor lost architectures vs. creeping normality) signaled early; textural escalation via deepening hush and warmth bloom narrows to shard's presence with felt cost (ghostly unclenching). Agency in palm press; one tightening coherent under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory-sanctification emerges organically from ritual images; final walk-home as "breadcrumbs for the soul" offers resonant CR reweighting without moralizing. Particulars (orris, cottage) build ambiguity of alive houses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (textures like "pollen to ribs"); stable close third modulates rhythm from whisper to blaze. Pattern-taught poeticism legible at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("hush" accumulates); metaphors coherent (heartbeat against glass), no loops or scaffolds dulling propulsion. Rhythmic variety supports hush-to-blaze cadence; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of creeping normality with scent-objects sanctifying ghost houses; bold lyric risk heightens stakes in final reconfiguration. Irreplaceable premise transforms ritual trope organically.</comment>
