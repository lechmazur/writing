<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via scars as conduits and precise hunger overriding trembling, earning the final merge; interiority concrete and particular, with contradictory reverence amid urgency. Blind spots in mythic competence slightly limit individual flaws from complicating peak choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of roots, scars, and clipping builds to Charged Poise closure; "It sank. The ground exhaled. Light erupted" delivers legible conceptual cost of merging selves. Orientation anchored early in glade and time-rift arrival; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt glade and moss constrain via root-anchoring and clipping-sink, charging final helix image; sensory hierarchy (scent of iron/incense, humming canopy) filters through visionary bias. Details evolve causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive eclipsed covenant at dream intersection) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via glowing scars and clipping-pull to helix eruption; agency in kneeling/press forecloses path with merge-cost. One tightening suffices, reweighting options legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of enduring dream-vows emerges organically from ritual uncoiling and whispers, answered non-literally by final unison breathing; resonance from scarred threads recharges premise without moralizing. Complexity lingers in festering covenants' ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (neural scars, bone/leaf signs) modulates rhythm to climax; POV stable, bias in "purposefully curious gaze" selective. Compression taught early pays off in charged final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax and no loops; figurative texture consistent in lyric mode, taught early without muddle—"cobalt of the glade itself, spiraling upward" clear at peak. Zero scaffold, rhythm accelerates to exhale/eruption.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-rift scars and topiary-key ritual transforms covenant trope; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via root-merge image. Bold voice commits fully without hedging.</question>
