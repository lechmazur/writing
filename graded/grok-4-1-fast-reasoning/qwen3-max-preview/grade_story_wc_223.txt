<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through walking patterns and penumbra mirroring; motivation as historian intensifies via survivor gestures, earning final non-bow with cost of exposure. Minor epiphanic summaries ("I realized then") slightly abstract realization without full embodiment, but don't touch closure defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solo circuits to collective glyphs and sovereign arrival, delivering CR closure as penumbra pools at feet, reweighting power with legible conceptual cost in "terror of being truly seen." Orientation anchored early; no shards, pattern taught immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gallery's domed echoes and circular floor constrain walking glyphs and amplify silences, charging final "listen" circuit; slanting light on board mirrors internal states purposefully. Recurrent penumbra as micro-setting evolves tactilely, filtering through POV survival bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reveal truth via gestures) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via survivor joining and woman’s ring, narrowing to sovereign confrontation with agency in final walk. Cost felt in sovereign's tremble; tightening sufficient under lens, minor abstraction in early stakes declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of absence-as-syntax emerges organically from pawn removal and glyph-walking, resonant CR in final image reweighting thrones without moralizing. Woman's "unbind" whisper carries subtext of role-shedding, inviting ambiguity on power's fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in gesture-noticing and penumbra diction; rhythmic modulation peaks in terse final circuit. Single POV stable, whisper dialogue natural/subtextual; purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "heel-to-toe arcs tracing glyphs"); rhythm varies read-aloud. Dense figurative layering ("luminous absence," "benevolently ruthless" reprise) borders overwrite in mid-beats without muddle, but risks opacity; no loops touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crisis actor in interregnum with glyph-walking and penumbra companion transforms tropes; pawnless board and "listen" defiance feel inevitable. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
