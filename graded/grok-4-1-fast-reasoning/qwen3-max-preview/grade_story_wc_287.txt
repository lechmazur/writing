<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (wistfully pragmatic hands) act in scene via deliberate prism placements under personal cost (past fire trauma), earning final smile of quiet certainty that forecloses sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density of prism placements tightening to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "knees aching" and warmed tooth as she leaves, reconfiguring hush to reverence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Railed fire escape and moonlight constrain sequential placements, charging final prism's "sapphire and amber" dance; sensory hierarchy (visual fractures over harbor mercury) mirrors POV priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (instill resilience) escalates accumulatively via gasps/murmurs below, driven by her agency; cost unmistakable in aching knees and endured past sealing final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of measured hope emerges organically from tooth-guided light reflections; final "city exhaled into dawn" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting fragility without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature (blooms from cracks, light into dark); rhythmic control heightens quiet pressure, e.g., "steady, patient, inevitable."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and integrated imagery; minor figurative density ("crimson sigh," "spilled mercury") purposeful in lyric mode without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gardener's prisms as light "oars" transforms rooftop ritual into resonant defiance; tooth's reweighting from lockpick to depth-gauge feels inevitable and risks lyric boldness.</comment>
