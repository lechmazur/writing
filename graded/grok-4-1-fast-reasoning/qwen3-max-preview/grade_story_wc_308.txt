<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to navigate via stillness is consistent and compels endurance, shown through appraisal amid flock; interiority poetic but lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, leaning abstract. Final renunciation of motion earned by prior causality with generational cost legible. No other characters, so single-POV baseline met solidly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via layered dust and resonance, holds to Charged Poise closure: skimmer aligns as landmark, cost felt in "Generations had died seeking motion" and final waiting image. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (skimmer on bone tower in canyon). Single scene fits defaults; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Towers of bone and canyon echoes constrain stillness and appraisal, charging final thumb-trace on arrowhead; sensory hierarchy (humming walls, wingbeats) reflects skimmer's priorities. Details purposeful, integrated via perception; recurring dust and marrow mirror internal alignment. Environment shapes tactics indelibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode wandering pulse without moving) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as flock patterns deliver pulse to chest, narrowing to endurance; agency in deep listening forecloses motion path with on-page cost of isolation. One tightening sufficient under lens; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of stillness as true navigation emerges organically from appraisal and flock hymn, reweighted in final image: "You become the landmark" offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like smooth arrowhead grooves; ambiguity lingers in surrender's cost. Protagonist arc inextricable from question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in "tuning inner resonance to wingbeats"; voice texture rhythmic and biased toward echoes/pulses, modulating to charged final cadence. No dialogue or head-hopping; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short appraisal beats amid longer lyric swells); high density, no loops or scaffolds—repetitions like "stillness" pattern-taught for resonance. Metaphors coherent (physics as reverence); propulsion peaks in flock decoding, breathes in ending image. Zero artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic skimmer decoding physics via bird patterns transforms navigation trope; risk in lyric stasis heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration ("guidance... is mirrored") inevitable from stillness premise; no derivative echoes.</comment>
