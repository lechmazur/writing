<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prophet's motivation to turn obstacles into instruments drives concrete micro-choices like humming the root-note amid darkening sea; Kael applies pressure via dubbing and fumbled strike. Interiority concrete via gestures and euphoria at climax, but lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final passing of warm mallet earns change with exhaustion cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound density builds from cloud whispers to wave xylophone, fruit bursts, helix resolving fractals into harmonic rain (Charged Poise RR with exhaustion cost). Single scene anchored early; no orientation debt. Closure image of tide carrying music inward reconfigures stakes legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard afloat constrains via root-note hum and bursting fruit that alters sea; driftwood edge enables wave-playing. Sensory hierarchy sound-dominant reflects Prophet's priorities, evolving causally (sea thickens to translucent hum). Final orchard sigh charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control sound-tide via clouds/orchard) signaled early, tightens via darkening sea forcing root-note improvisation under Accumulative lens. Prophet's agency (conducting to fruit-seeds) forecloses chaos path; Kael's apple strike crystallizes with felt exhaustion. Visible cost in dropped conch and tossed mallet narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming obstacles emerges via particulars (wave xylophone, fruit drums), final helix/image reweights premise without moralizing. Restless euphony pulses through unresolved phrases to charged release, inviting ambiguity on music's deeper carry. No tidy resolution; exhaustion adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with sound-biased perceptual signature; voice modulates rhythmically from urgent arcs to exhausted smile. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Dub again," "Catch the resonance!"). Diction/rhythm heighten pressure, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (resonance trails, fractal mandalas) taught early, pays off in visible helix without muddle. Rhythm varies (short strikes amid long swells); no loops or scaffolds dull climax. Minor overwriting in fractal descriptors doesn't obscure sea-thickening cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes music/weather/magic into fresh wave-xylophone/orchard instruments; risky poetic compression heightens stakes (e.g., Kael's fumbled strike alters clouds). No tropes untransformed; conceptual integrity in sketched resonance follows implications to inward tide.</comment>
