<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prince's contradictory exhaustion and stubborn vow act simultaneously in hypothesizing and egg-whispers, earning final laughter-through-tears stasis with uncertainty cost; embodied emotions like trembling fingers ground interiority without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via density build from blueprints to palm-press; RR/Charged Poise lands in egg's pulse and world-tuning, cost legible in "did not know if it would hatch... or ever" silhouette image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stalactite-dripping palace constrains rite via quaking chains that "sang" in awakening; shattered mirrors' skies charge closure, sensory details like steam-whistles selective through prince's hopeful bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake to reawaken beauty deepens accumulatively via nightly theories to activation hum, agency in palm-press foreclosing obsolescence with decades' isolation cost viscerally felt in ribs-shake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Egg's "chirp... also a chime... bitterly sweet" reconfigures mechanical premise non-literally, beauty-as-oxygen emergent from dandelion cue and flawed particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature hypothesizes "if grief can be a catalyst," rhythmic modulation crescendos to pulsing closure; stable single-POV biases toward wonder without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density in "copper veins... pendulums to mimic avian heartbeats" propels without loops; metaphors like "mineral tears" cohere texturally, climax imagery crisp under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Steampunk flawed genesis via hypothesizing transforms relic-egg trope organically; quaking palace risk heightens textural stakes, inevitable in bittersweet silhouette hindsight.</comment>
