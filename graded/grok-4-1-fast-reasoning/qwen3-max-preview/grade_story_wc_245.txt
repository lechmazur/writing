<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like kneeling to absorb G-sharp nostalgia, earn the final reconfiguration; motivation consistently drives endurance without safety-hedging. Minor slip: lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in pivotal tests, but competence balances with felt grief costs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from single notes to chorus convergence, yielding on-page Resonant Reconfiguration at stillpoint entry and ring removal—cost legible in "not healed, but tuned." Orientation anchored early; single scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest and moss "chiming like glass bells" constrain choices via vibrations and test emotions; blind POV filters selectively to touch/sound, charging final silence image. Purpose-driven sensory hierarchy matches urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mapping emotional depths escalates accumulatively via thickening chorus narrowing to glade, forcing stance crystallization in sphere; agency in stepping inside forecloses absorption path with "steady and unafraid" cost felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief/joy as "harmonics of the same note" emerges organically from note absorption to stillpoint silence, reweighting premise in final whisper without moralizing; resonant image of new musical trail lingers with ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with synesthetic perceptual signature ("languages... pulsing like veins") stable in single blind POV; rhythmic modulation heightens pressure from thrum to pause, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image integration ("moss that chimed like glass bells"); figurative language coherent and pattern-taught in lyric mode, no loops or artifacts dulling climax silence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of skin-language absorption and ultrasonic emotional topography transforms sensory tropes into bold premise; risk-taking in stillpoint absence as full potential heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
