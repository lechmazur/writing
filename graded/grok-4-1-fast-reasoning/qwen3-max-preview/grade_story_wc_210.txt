<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alchemist's rejection of nostalgia drives consistent micro-choices like sweeping dust into mandalas and giving the bottle away, earning renunciation with felt cost. Interiority particular via bottle-glow visions; child interaction reveals hierarchy of values. Minor flaw: child's understanding undramatized, but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from isolation to lantern emergence, culminating in Charged Poise CR—"the last unopened thing in a town learning to open itself"—with conceptual cost of alchemist's forfeited ownership legible in final image. Orientation anchored by ~50 words. One tightening via child's bottle-holding sparks revival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like "tattered silk globes swayed... wires creaking like unanswered prayers" filter through alchemist's priorities, constraining choices (dust mandalas, cobblestone lanterns). Recurring lanterns charge final image, evolving causally from his invitations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reinvented revival vs. nostalgia) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via lanterns' emergence, narrowing to collective becoming. Agency in invitations forecloses solo control, cost felt in bottle's transfer. Enters 8+ via trade-off charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth via overlooked possibilities emerges organically from bottle's synthesis and lantern altars, resonant CR in "civilization was not restored. It was reborn" reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable, perceptual signature in "hum[ming] equations into the wind"; child's dialogue natural/subtextual. Rhythmic control modulates from desolate to humming revival.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion—"silence pooled in alleyways, and dust settled on thresholds like uninvited heirs"—but figurative density borders overwriting in midbuild (e.g., multiple swirl/contour images); purposeful lyric pattern taught early, no closure harm. No loops/artifacts dulling end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ingenious bottle as "working memory made manifest" transforms alchemist trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative revival feels inevitable, synthesizing fantasy with conceptual depth.</comment>
