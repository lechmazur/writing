<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Modestly fearless trait shown concretely in kneeling beside dread and playing flute amid shuddering gorge, earning fuller integration; motivation to weave laughter into grief drives all micro-choices with embodied luminous ache as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dissonance builds to cadence shift in harmonized laughter and ghost integration; resonant reconfiguration closure lands cleanly with throat-tight ache as felt cost in final descent image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Gorge's misaligned harp constrains path and guides via warped melody, charging closure as it softens tenderly; crocodile tooth as micro-setting pulses and smooths edges in peak integration beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of integrating spectral grief via harmonization escalates accumulatively through flute trill forcing confessions to laughter break; agency in clumsy trill narrows dissonance with visible gorge shudder and ache cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of laughter as grief's sibling emerges organically from particulars like boyish snort and seeping giggles; final woman's "silly again" and collector's bruise-like joy reweight premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close POV stable with perceptual bias toward distorted sounds and spectral weight; voice rhythm modulates from hush to trill-crack, distinct diction like "moon-thread" satchel sustains texture under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but figurative pile-up in climax ("shadows peeled... layered over... pulsed warm") borders coherence strain without obscuring closure; no loops, strong propulsion in trill-to-giggle shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geology as warped harp instrument and tooth-metabolized confessions transforms soul-collection trope; risk in lyric dissonance-to-harmony risks gimmick but heightens stakes organically to inevitable smile-touch closure.</comment>
