<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in the pivotal dialogue where blunt truth flinches them, forcing occlusion that reveals her values; final renunciation of the eye is earned through prior embodied struggle, with visible cost in her solitary walk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from foraging to figures' arrival and eye's release; closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly in "Let it find the next truthful soul," reconfiguring her reliance with conceptual cost of trust, orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Hanging orchard constrains choices via swaying cables and plunging branch; recurring mycelium and roots charge final image of enduring balance, sensory details (petrichor, musky scent) selectively mirror internal softening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of cultivating safety tightens accumulatively with figures' arrival and flinch, narrowing her options to occlude; agency in adaptive speech and eye release forecloses self-reliance path, cost felt in their unknotting shoulders and her whisper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of safety via surrender emerges organically from occlusion to release; final image of child’s laugh reweights "truth now a companion, not a curse" without moralizing, resonant non-literal answer to emotional muting.</comment>
