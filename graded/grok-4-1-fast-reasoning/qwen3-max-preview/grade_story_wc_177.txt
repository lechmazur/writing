<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between foresight/hindsight tyranny and precisely playful defiance act in the calibrated steps and dream descent; final transcendence earned via child-crossroads vision with conceptual cost of surrendering linear time.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density surge in dream visions building to CR closure; "wafer seal grew warm... glowing faintly gold" makes release cost legible as bunker/directive surrender.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vines and bunker constrain choices like alarm-avoiding steps and final detachment; storm charges images from "lightning forked through the canopy" to rain "sliding off her shoulders," mirroring internal release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of path-revelation tightens via vision deepening at child-crossroads, agency-driven under accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in seal's release and bunker's "swallowed by roots and rot."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of resonant paths emerges organically from dream symbols and directive whisper "You were always the path"; final forest salute reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in dream-symbol decoding and playful phrasing; rhythmic diction like "half-dance, half-defiance" modulates pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; purposeful metaphors like "blooming... like a slow detonation" propel without muddling peak dream beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of decaying AI and path-resonance transforms bunker trope; risky lyric accumulation heightens inevitability of "walkers... become the road" without gimmickry.</comment>
