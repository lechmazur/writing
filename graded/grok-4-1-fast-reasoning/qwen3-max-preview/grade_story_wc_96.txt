<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction between sardonic shell and grief-driven softening, embodied in "old skin of cynicism peel away"; final gardener stance earned by Elias's poem triggering micro-choices like pinning and planting with visible emotional cost. Voice particular and flawed without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from unfolding tin to planting seeds to singing, culminating in Charged Poise closure where moonlight "stitching the fractures" reconfigures cynicism to fierce possibility with grief as felt cost. Orientation anchored early; one tightening via grief suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ruin's cracks constrain seed-planting choice and charge final singing image; sensory hierarchy (fogging breath, clinking tin, dust) reflects Molt's priorities, mirroring internal molt without overt symbolism. Evolving details like wax pooling integrate purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forge beauty from anarchy/grief) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through poem-pinning, seed-planting, and singing that crystallize stance; agency in micro-choices forecloses cynicism with embodied cost in cracking voice and shed shell.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Blooming resistance emerges organically from seeds in cracks and decay-to-cathedral shift, with final lullaby image resonating non-literally on "rivers that remember" without moralizing; subtext in marginalia rebellion avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in ink-stained metaphors and philosopher quotes; rhythmic prose modulates from sardonic crunch to luminous singing, reflecting molt without leakage. Distinct texture heightens pressure legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; minor figurative density in ending ("liquid starlight," "open ribs") coherent via molting pattern, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image of singing absorbing into rust.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of molting poet planting revolutions in ruins transforms vagrant trope via prison-smuggled seeds motif; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
