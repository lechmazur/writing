<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied recognition ("She wept—not from sorrow, but recognition") earning the final renunciation; contradictory impulses (solitary collection vs. collaborative sharing) act in pivotal discovery and closure choice. Earnestly studious trait drives micro-choices like cross-referencing overlaps. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from personal inventions to foreign resonance ("This wasn’t from her own inventions") tightening knowledge, culminating in Charged Poise RR closure ("left the notepad open... walked deeper") with legible cost of exposing her archive. Orientation anchored early in climb/path. One decisive deepening suffices perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bonsai forests and lamp constrain choices (pause beneath juniper, ear to casing) and charge final image ("trees... bent their branches just enough to shield the notepad"); sensory details (dew, mist, hum) selective via studious POV bias. Micro-setting (lamp, bench, maze) evolves purposefully, mirroring internal archive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collecting time-textures) signaled early, escalates texturally via non-her resonance and overlaps, forcing agency (refract harder, leave notepad) that forecloses solitary path with felt exposure cost under lamp's approving flicker. Single tightening reweights options coherently. No abstraction; viscerally embodied in nerves/sensations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of shared fictions emerges organically from particulars (bonsai rings, lamp hums), reweighted in closure image of open notepad as chorus invitation without moralizing. Subtext in overlaps ("shared metaphor of falling stars") invites ambiguity on solitude vs. collaboration. Final action answers central question resonantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with textural perceptual signature ("textures... pressed like petals"); stable single-POV distance modulates rhythmically with intensity (short sentences in discovery thrum). Compression purposeful and taught early, legible to charged end. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "each tree a living archive" advances setting/character/stakes); rhythm varies (long descriptive swells to tight closure beats) without loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful/textural, no muddle in peak discovery. Propulsion clean to final flicker.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise of lamp-hum refracting invented histories via bonsai synthesizes fresh angle on memory/myth; lyric risk (pure accumulation sans dialogue/plot turns) heightens textural stakes, inevitable in hindsight. No tropes untransformed; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
