<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in ignoring mirror warnings while weaving under resistance, earning the older-self transformation at closure; interiority particular via geometric patterns and embodied thread pulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup via stitching to eruption/reconfiguration; Charged Poise closure lands cleanly in thread release stitching ruptured space, with cost in transformed mirrors/self.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gallery constrains choices (navigating illusions, responding to stitches) and charges final image (eruption to new corridor); selective sensory warps like "walls rippled like muscle" evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (texture of connection) tightens via gallery resistance narrowing weave options; agency in persistent stitching drives eruption, with legible cost in personal reconfiguration charging new threshold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from stitching memories to answer "What holds us together?" via texture friction; final thread-branching image reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of pattern-geometry (spirals for nostalgia); rhythmic prose modulates intensity, reflecting architect's rational precision under chaos.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with zero loops/artifacts; varied rhythm propels via purposeful metaphors like "staircases dissolved into ribbons," clear in peak eruption without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rational enchantment transforms surreal tropes; risk in textural accumulation feels inevitable, heightened by thread's irreplaceable logic to closure.</comment>
