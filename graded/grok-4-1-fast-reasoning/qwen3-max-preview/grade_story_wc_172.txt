<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses peak in the imperfect Skywren call whispered amid his destructive history, earning the "felt clean" renunciation with embodied cost of irrecoverable sentiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual placements build to resonant echo (cracks glow, sigh rises), delivering Charged Poise closure with cost in the egg's permanent dimming and map's dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Salt flat constrains ritual via resonant crust and crack-veins, charging final image where earth absorbs echo, with POV bias filtering drought as reverent space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of echo-preservation escalates via density (egg placement → whisper → resonance), protagonist agency in release foreclosing retrieval with felt emotional price on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Echo as atonement reconfigures premise in egg's absorption into cracks, resonant non-literal answer to destruction's grace without moralizing, arising organically from ritual particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature biases toward sentimental ghosts amid ruin; rhythmic hush-to-crescendo suits accumulative poise, with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds, high density propels via varied syntax mirroring resonance build; faint figurative density (e.g., "windshield smudged with salt and starlight") enhances without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Crack-map ritual transforms philanthropist atonement into inevitable lyric echo, bold risk in resonance mechanics heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
