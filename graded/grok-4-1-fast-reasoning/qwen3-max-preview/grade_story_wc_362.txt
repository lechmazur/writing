<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mystic's grounded skepticism and scientific rigor shine in recording/measuring amid visions, earning final renunciation of publication; micro-choices like sketching numb-fingered reveal values hierarchy without epiphanic jumps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds flawlessly from prism alignment to frost-veins pulsing faces, tightening to resonant realization "Proof was not in replication, but in resonance"; melting frost delivers legible release-cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quartz arbor's hum and mist's velvet thickening amplify communion, constraining her steady breaths; recurring frost fractals as diary charge the pivotal interface and melting payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to prove emotion-absorption deepens via surfacing visions/relief, forcing trade-off of borrowed fear for personal silence; agency in pressing prism narrows to non-publication cost, legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Notebook's "Emotion is mass. Memory is gravity." crystallizes theme of resonant memory without preaching; final prism-rainbows tasting salt reweights premise obliquely, embracing truthful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature—frost as braille, veins as capillaries—holds close-third stability; rhythm modulates from hush's rearrangement to luminous exit, apt for mystic's texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated metaphors like mist parting "like a curtain for an actor"; varied syntax breathes with revelation rhythm, zero loops even in peak visions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frost-prism as emotion-diary transforms mysticism trope via grounded science; risk of quiet CR closure pays off in irreplaceable rainbows "tasting of salt and stillness."</comment>
