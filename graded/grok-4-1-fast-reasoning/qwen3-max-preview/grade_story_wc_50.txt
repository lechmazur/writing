<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied micro-choices like aligning mirrors at precise times and peripheral gaze avoiding direct stare; motivation to preserve wonder drives consistent traits without epiphanies. Contradictory impulses (logic vs. intuition) act in scene, earning the closure renunciation of direct repair for archival stasis. Minor poetic abstraction in motivation statement doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries at 11:03 glyph and dusk tone build density to Charged Poise closure when he seals slab and leaves, reconfiguring broken timer as fulcrum with felt cost of abandonment for future use. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; single scene with time progression fits scope. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (quartz pulses, crystal shards raining) filtered through POV's angle obsession constrain choices like mirror alignments and shard collection. Cavern veining and light shaft charge final image of fermenting wonder. Micro-setting (timer face, stalactites) mirrors internal resonance without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coaxing echoes to store wonder) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via glyph revelation and tone-shard event narrowing direct repair options. Agency in deliberate non-forcing yields deepening resonance; closure cost legible in leaving archive behind. Subtle pressure fits lens without reversal mandate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of peripheral wonder preservation emerges organically from light-angle motifs shifting to travelers' future discovery, offering non-literal answer in final image without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like cinnamon glyphs avoids platitudes; internal arc inextricable from question. No thematic echo or tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in angle-syntax metaphors and peripheral noticing; voice modulates rhythmically from deliberate slowness to smiling reverence at close. Purposeful poetic compression taught early remains legible under accumulative lens. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety and high density propel via integrated images (light as scribe); figurative language coherent and pattern-taught without muddle in discovery beats. No loops, scaffolds, or template cadence; minor dense metaphors in opener don't obscure closure image of sealed slab.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith-as-light-harvester transforms reflection tropes into echo-preservation premise; bold lyric accumulation risks poetic density but heightens stakes coherently. Irreplaceable angle-language and peripheral method feel inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes or hedging.</comment>
