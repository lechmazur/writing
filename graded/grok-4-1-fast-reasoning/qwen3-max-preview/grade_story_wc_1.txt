<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in tracing ledger grit and smoothing on thigh reveals motives under survival pressure; contradictory impulses in subtraction vs. transformation earned via micro-choices like etching frost. Minor slip in diagnostic lines like "Survival... was subtraction" borders therapy-speak but anchors present stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from ledger to frost synchrony ("looping cipher that mirrored the smuggler’s ledger script"); CR closure in "framed in a disc of her own glass, hung above her kiln" reconfigures rupture to altar with conceptual cost of endless retracing legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Canyon frost patterns constrain choices (kneeling to study, etching into glass) and charge final image of sculptures among stones; sensory selection (brittle edges, galaxy spirals) mirrors adaptive persistence without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of purpose in pauses tightens via frost-ledger match narrowing to "map of survival’s hidden path"; endurance agency forecloses hiding for transformation with felt subtraction cost, coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of retracing loss to meaning emerges via ledger-frost-glass arc, resonant CR in "glass—... sang back" reweighting premise without moral; complexity in mercy vs. commerce avoids binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature in pattern-noticing (filigree glyphs) with rhythmic modulation; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off in charged poise without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density in lines like "spirals mimicking galaxy arms, branching veins echoing capillaries" propels via varied rhythm; minor figurative density risks overwrite but stays voice-motivated without loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ledger as escape map with frost cartography transforms survival trope; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
