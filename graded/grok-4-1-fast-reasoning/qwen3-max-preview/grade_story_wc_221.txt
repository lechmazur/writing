<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under isolation pressure, with motivation rooted in curiosity earning the final endurance; family backstory anchors reflection without flattening drive. Minor label-reliance on "blessed pariah" slightly abstracts traits but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from stars to anomaly sketch; on-page CR as filament vanishes post-sketch reconfigures confusion into presence, with isolation cost legible in final turn from glass. Orientation anchors immediately; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chilled glass and hummed deck constrain sketching stance; temporally stretched stars and violet filament charge final image as micro-setting evolved through action. Sensory details filtered via POV's sketching bias mirror internal rhythm shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of confusion-to-exploration signaled early tightens via anomaly glimpse forcing sketch decision, narrowing to endurance with pariah cost felt in companionable silence. Accumulative escalation via density suffices; agency in witnessing forecloses flight option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of true north as curiosity emerges organically from sketching ritual and anomaly absorption, with final image offering non-literal reconfiguration of distortion as revelation. No moralizing; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sketching-filtered observations; rhythmic modulation builds from echoed silence to affirmed poise without head-hopping or elision withholding. Voice texture controlled, prose as character in reverent strokes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion aligns with sketching beats. Minor metaphor density in star descriptions risks overwrite but coheres in accumulative pattern without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal sci-fi with ancestral sketching transforms isolation trope; anomaly absorption feels inevitable from established ritual, with risk in lyric distortion heightening stakes.</comment>
