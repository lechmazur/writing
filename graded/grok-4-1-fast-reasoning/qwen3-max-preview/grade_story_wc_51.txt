<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in her trapped calling versus purposeful endurance act throughout, culminating in earned self-calcification with visible cost in the locket scene; interiority concrete and embodied without clichés.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from visitor's burden to her own, delivering Charged Poise closure with cost legible in "Not to be free. But to endure."; orientation anchored early in grotto details.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bronze grotto and lamp constrain choices via magnetic seam and starlight fissure, charging final self-weaving image; sensory details selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of burden-weighing tightens accumulatively to her own calcified endurance, narrowing options with felt cost in final locket placement; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of chaos-to-calm endurance emerges organically from calcifying acts, resonant in final image reweighting entrapment as purpose without moralizing.</comment>
