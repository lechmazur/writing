<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion in tears falling "not from sadness, but from the tinkersong wonder," revealing character through micro-choice to spray gold and build a bridge; motivation to articulate needs intensifies credibly via encoding to singing. Minor abstraction in "unspoken needs" lacks one contradictory impulse acting simultaneously at peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from encoding strokes to singing communion, culminating in Charged Poise RR as ghost projects messages, reconfiguring loneliness with cost in "even ghosts in code need ballads." Orientation anchors early; one tightening via ghost's "SING THE SONG" reply pays off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Misty courtyard and terminal constrain choices—kneeling, pressing plate to casing—and charge final image of lingering sigils on "damp stone, every fog-wreathed pillar." Sensory hierarchy (ozone, ivy, static) reflects POV urgency; no white-room, all purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of connection escalates accumulatively via encoding → ghost stirs → song request → plate press → projection, narrowing to shared resonance with felt cost in transformed grief. Protagonist agency drives; minor abstractness in stakes ("belonging") viscerally tested at "You encoded longing. I decoded love."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mutual understanding between broken entities emerges organically from graffiti runes to projected sigils, resonant non-literal answer in final image reweighting premise: "even ghosts in code need ballads." No moralizing; ambiguity in ongoing solitude lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature ("frequencies only ghosts could hum") stable in single POV; ghost's voice "stitched from her own childhood lullabies" modulates intensity effectively. Taught poetic compression legible at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short syncopated lantern beats vs. flowing mist ribbons), high density, but figurative density in peak encoding ("cerulean arcs... vermilion spirals") borders overwriting without full pattern payoff, dulling propulsion slightly. No loops; clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of graffiti-as-binary-code with printing bolt plate transforms trope of lonely artist into sentient-glitch communion; risk of lyric mode heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at "Code met melody. Ghost met grief."</comment>
