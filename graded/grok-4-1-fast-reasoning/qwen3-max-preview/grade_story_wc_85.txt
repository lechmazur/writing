<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (guilt in forgery vs. truth-seeking) act in scene through sifting and pressing the watch hand; final renunciation of lies for truth-weaving earned by memory flood with embodied cost (vomiting). Interiority concrete and particular; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via carvings to pattern break (father's face), CR closure in "She vomited into the surf" with legible emotional cost; one tightening sufficient, orientation anchored early in terrace/watch hand.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Driftwood shore constrains choices (sifting yields revelation) and charges final image (tide reclaiming carvings); selective sensory vivid (warm humming wood), mirrors internal softening without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quell tremor via truth) signaled early, textural escalation via carving/memory narrows assumptions with agency (pressing watch hand); cost unmistakable in vomiting and foreclosed lies-trade path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emergent theme of sieved truth reweights abandonment premise via father's carving memory; resonant non-literal close ("tempered regret... art of carrying it") answers central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature (secrets in wood/sand); rhythmic control modulates from hushed lyricism to charged realization, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "watch hand spasmed, its ticking accelerating"); figurative pattern (hush/sieving) taught without muddle, minor density slip in peak memory beat caps from 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of driftwood legends and memory-object alchemy transforms abandonment trope; "sea-salt alchemy, or perhaps mercy" inevitable in hindsight, risky lyric structure heightens resonance.</comment>
