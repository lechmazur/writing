<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Operator's micro-choices (exhale matching vial unwind, weight shift to chime-trees) reveal contradictory empathy under endless duty; woman's embodied progression from clenched knuckles to fingertip mist-touch earns release without interior access.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as vial swirls densify from gray fog to golden pulse; Charged Poise closure lands on-page in "storm glass gave one final pulse—warm, golden, complete" with legible emotional cost; orientation anchored early in operator's duty on prism terrace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Chime-trees' subsonic vibration and upward-falling mist constrain Operator's tactics and charge woman's tear/release moment; sensory hierarchy (sound textures over visuals) filters through his calibrated ears.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (catalyze passenger stillness) signaled early tightens texturally via vial's fog-to-eddies shift, narrowing to her shoulders dropping; agency in subtle tilts/endurance forecloses anxiety with vial-cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silence-as-vessel emerges implicitly from vial's predictive swirls and her unshed-to-invited tear; final ramp-step image reweights premise without statement, lingering ambiguity in operator's ongoing readiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (noise textures, vial logics) modulates rhythmically from vaulting hush to harmonic hum; purposeful poetic compression taught early sustains legibility at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythms (short hums amid long drifts) with zero loops or scaffolds; figurative coherence peaks cleanly in "fluidly logical unwinding" without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Storm glass as emotional barometer transforms transit-sanctuary premise into inevitable hush-deepening cadence; risk in wordless agency heightens stakes organically.</comment>
