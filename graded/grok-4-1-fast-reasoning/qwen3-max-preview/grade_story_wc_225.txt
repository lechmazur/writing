<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in trembling recognition while winnowing threads; final renunciation of fidgeting to steady walk earned by causal thread-mending, with cost of carrying truth lightly. Interiority concrete and chess-specific, avoiding epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from entry gambits to thickened hush and mirror Charged Poise, where "I see you" dissolves fog into acceptance with legible emotional cost on-page. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Platinum walls and frayed threads constrain winnowing choices and charge mirror closure; time-frozen details (suspended wine, held sighs) selectively mirror internal states through tactile perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening winnow to mirror confrontation narrowing to acceptance; agency in tracing words forecloses denial with felt cost of unflinching past-view.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of patterned forgiveness emerges organically from threads reknitting stronger; final walking image offers resonant reconfiguration of exile as irrelevant without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of chess patterns and thread tensions; rhythmic prose modulates intensity from hush-thickening to exhale-release without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative layering (e.g., "woven hush thickened") borders overwriting in deepening beat without obscuring closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth and winnowing threads synthesize chess exile into fresh textural quest; risk of lyric accumulation heightens stakes, transforming maze trope inevitably to breathing mistakes.</comment>
