<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation: ink-stained fingers and tears blurring staves embody rebellion, with micro-choices like crying as catalyst earning the final broadcast. Contradictory impulses (routine cloaking vs. risky transcription) act in scene, culminating in earned reconfiguration from scribe to transmitter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pulsing dial to dust theaters to her broadcast, with closure as Charged Poise (transmission activates network) and legible cost in tears/singed thumb. Orientation anchored early in alcove; one tightening via "The inkwell dreams..." song reconfigures her role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ember alcove, mist, and dust motes constrain choices (midnight tuning, tears flare embers) and charge final image ("another alcove would warm"). Sensory hierarchy (heat over light) reflects POV urgency; setting evolves causally with broadcasts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resurrect stories) signaled early, escalates via lens with density increase (hotter pulse, personal song forcing tears); agency in crying/broadcasting forecloses passive listening. Cost legible in embodied mourning, charging closure without resolving famine.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of dust-remembering emerges organically from lyrics unlocking whispers, tears as catalyst; final broadcast reweights premise (solitary rebellion to network) with resonant ambiguity. No moralizing; counter-readings (risk of detection) linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (mist as "sigh," dust as "miniature theaters"); rhythmic modulation peaks in "heart thudding like a timpani roll" under stress. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (mist, glow, dust); no loops or scaffolds, propulsion varies rhythmically. Minor overwriting in opening metaphors pattern-taught without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pirate songs resurrecting dust-stories via tears transforms tropes organically. Risky lyric premise commits fully, with "thistled calm" finale inevitable from particulars; no derivatives.</comment>
