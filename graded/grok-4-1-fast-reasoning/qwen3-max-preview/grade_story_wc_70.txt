<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's involuntary truthfulness drives pivotal admissions like "They never stopped," revealing character through constraint rather than declaration. Woman's shift from urgency to reverence feels earned via micro-choices. Minor slip: interiority occasionally tells traits over embodying contradictions under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: riddle exchange to tower climb to drone discovery builds density toward CR closure ("The tower doesn’t collect lightning. It collects belief.") with conceptual cost in slow revelation. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; single scene causality intact, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tower struts and copper veins constrain climb and host drones, charging final hum image; blackout specifics filter through Elias's routine. Sensory hierarchy (humming, pollen, nectar) reflects POV priorities without catalog. Environment mirrors adaptation theme purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder vs. urgent report) signaled early, deepens via climb discovery narrowing options to shared revelation; cost legible in Elias's prior silence. Agency in riddle swap and ascent; lens-consistent tightening without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as slow lightning emerges implicitly via riddle exchanges and final box reveal, reweighting failure-to-adaptation without statement. Closing image ("drones began to hum") offers non-literal resonance to premise question, inviting ambiguity on belief's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (truth spilling "like sap"); dialogue subtextual ("You knew") advances stakes naturally, voices distinct (Elias's candor vs. woman's terseness). Rhythmic modulation peaks at drone hum; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: lines like "abdomens pulsed with stored charge, faint blue flickers syncing with... thunderheads" advance image, character, atmosphere. Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; metaphors coherent (sap, nectar) without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Drone bees as evolved capacitors on belief-collecting tower synthesizes sci-fi ecology with lyric wonder organically; riddle matchboxes transform trope exchange. Risky nectar/bee motif heightens stakes via irreplaceable world-logic payoff at hum.</comment>
