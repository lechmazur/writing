<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vey's timeless heartbeat embodies contradiction, surging only with emotion to compel capsule-tracing and fragment-fusing choices; Lira's arrival forces relational crucible with credible endurance of prior unmoored state, earning heart's steady beat as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from capsule etchings to urn fusion and silo visions, delivering Conceptual Repricing where "time isn’t to be measured" reconfigures Vey's curation role with conceptual cost in the final garage listings.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Emerald silo's hum and rippling panels constrain fusion act and charge closing visions; urn fragment's mother-of-pearl flecks and warmth filter through Vey's tactile priorities, mirroring internal texture shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to grasp time's texture tightens via Lira's palm on capsule rearranging glyphs, forcing fragment match with agency; cost legible in heart stutter and silo harmonization reweighting options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of accumulating echoes emerges via particulars like "grain by grain, breath by breath" to final "time accumulates like dust. Like love"; closing image of new listings offers non-literal answer, recharging premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature biases toward textures ("rough, smooth, brittle, elastic"); rhythmic prose modulates from introspective to resonant in fusion beat; sparse dialogue natural with Lira's whisper carrying subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density in lines like "whispering not of death, but of suspended moments" advances texture motif without loops; varied syntax propels to closure chime, passing read-aloud test with purposeful figurative consistency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Post-Recalibration world transforms time into textures via garage listings as "breadcrumbs," synthesizing fresh premise; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, with urn fusion feeling inevitable from established symbols.</comment>
