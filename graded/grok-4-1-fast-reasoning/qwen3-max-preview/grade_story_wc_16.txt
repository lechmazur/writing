<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength in embodied micro-choices like fist-pump after recovered note then immediate double-check revealing hierarchy of values; motivation to restore trust compels shift to communal risk with curator's warning as pressure. Minor telling in "cautious exuberance colored her every move" abstracts peak embodiment slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds from deciphering to performative climax with legible closure as Charged Poise in final chord's awe-silence; cost felt in "Sing only if you mean it" warning and risked semantic shattering. Orientation anchored early in archive/Syrathi; no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring glass ink well constrains testing (trembles with vowel) and charges final prismatic image; archive acoustics/resonances evolve to mirror restoration, pressuring choices in rotunda singing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of trust restoration tightens accumulatively via deepening realizations (promises chain → treaty betrayal → score composition), forcing group performance agency with legible risk/cost in "break the promise, the truth shatters." Escalation coheres under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of performed truths emerges via particulars like harmonic vow reconstruction; final "path...converging—in harmony" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting Silence premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with linguistic/musical perceptual signature (e.g., "vowel shift, every lost diacritic"); dialogue subtextual in curator exchange advances stakes naturally. Rhythmic control modulates intensity purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in resonant phrases like "dust motes into spirals"; varied rhythm/syntax supports ear-test flow, minor figurative density in peaks purposeful without muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistics-as-acoustics causing semantic collapse/restoration feels inevitable; bold risk in score-as-paper payoff transforms tropes organically.</comment>
