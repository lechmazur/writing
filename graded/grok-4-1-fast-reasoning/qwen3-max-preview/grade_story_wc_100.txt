<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (stubbornness vs. resignation) act in scene via lens tracing and prism embedding; final inner stillness earned by prior embedding beats with visible cost in deepened commitment. Single-POV interiority concrete and embodied in trembling hands steadying.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from unwrapping to soul impressions to final pulse RR (signals transform to belonging) with conceptual cost legible in "chased stillness settle... within him." Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Library constrains choices (deep stacks for embedding) and charges final image ("cathedral of quiet endings"); sensory details (brine currents, silt floor, ghost-light) filtered through undertaker's priorities, evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (answer unrest) escalates via agency-driven density (prism placements intensify signals, souls listen) under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in hands steadying and deeper walk, foreclosing prior exile stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (rest as belonging) emerges organically from particulars; final image ("broadcasted belonging... deeper") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting unrest to release without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct perceptual signature (dead's silence, light's memory); rhythmic control heightens pressure in activation beat, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "pulsed again, casting ghost-light"); zero loops, coherent metaphors (e.g., "frozen lightning"), varied rhythm supports cadence shift at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of undertaker + drowned library + soul-mending lens feels inevitable; risk-taking in underwater metaphysics heightens stakes, transforms tropes organically.</comment>
