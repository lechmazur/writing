<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirror maker's reverence and past as child compel grounded choices like deliberate breathing over chanting; embodied tension in trembling hands and pulse-alignment reveals character under pressure. Final craft as meaningful renunciation earns closure without tidy epiphany. Minor summary in "She understood" slightly abstracts interior conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: breathing cadence densifies frost pulses, sextant vibrations, fog thinning to dream descent, culminating in on-page DC (dream flows into obsidian glass) with felt cost ("her final craft"; fog thickens). Orientation anchored early in orchard; no lens ambiguity. Single scene coherence perfect for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fog and twilight frost constrain ritual (thins in rings, pulses blue, crystallizes air) and charge final image (thickens again); orchard's wet bark/ozone integrates tactilely via breath/action. POV-filtered selectivity (glass-maker notices prismatic shards on blossoms) mirrors internal softening. No white-room; micro-objects like sextant shards evolve causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture dream) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via breathing intensification narrowing to dream's curious alighting; agency in exhale and glass-press forecloses flight path with cost (final craft, boundary costs felt). One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres to Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of thresholds/costs emerges organically from breath-softened reality, sextant-to-mirror flow, and fog's return reweighting maker's triumph as endurance. Final image answers "lost vs. found" non-literally via swirling ink-settling without moralizing. Particulars like parchment wings avoid platitudes; ambiguity in dream's non-resistance lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited voice stable with perceptual signature (mirrors as "thresholds, invitations, traps"); syntax/rhythm modulates from deliberate setup to intensified pulses under ritual stress. Purposeful elision of backstory anchors to present cues like sextant; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density in multi-job lines (e.g., "frost on the grass pulsed faintly, glowing blue"); rhythm varies with breath counts for propulsion. Coherent metaphors (glass/dream fluidity) avoid muddle, but minor overwriting in "bruised violet sky... crystallized with suspended breath" risks density in setup. No loops or scaffolds dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirror-maker magic realism transforms dream-capture trope via sextant harmonics and breath-as-medium; risk in fog's opalescent thinning pays off in boundary-dissolving closure. Non-obvious "glass mountains" tone inflects voice ingeniously without gimmick.</comment>
