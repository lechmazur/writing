<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prism-minded trait consistently drives micro-choices like tracing sigils and decoding dialects under pressure; embodied reactions (heart hammering, breath caught) reveal character without labels. Minor slip: lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, yielding competent but untested endurance at closure. Final awakening of Seed earned via prior discoveries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of revelations (six eyes → fragment → sigil → chamber) tightens knowledge toward DC closure acquiring Seed, with legible cost in chamber sealing and gravity snap. Orientation anchored early (Elira reenters grotto during sky's sigh). No lens ambiguity; persistent inverted gravity constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inverted gravity and threshold effects (rising water, upside-down bridge) constrain choices like suspended dust and bat-like fragment, charging final gravity snap-back image. Sensory details (slick moss coiling light, floating silt) selectively mirror prism-mind perception, integrated into action. Final chamber's luminous shelves evolve causally from sigil path.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode seventh eye to reveal hidden combinations) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via fragment fusion narrowing options to chamber access under lens. Agency in whispering dialects forces trade-off (memory seared by glyph blaze); cost legible in sealed chamber foreclosing reaccess. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vigilance-seeded-in-margins theme emerges organically from doodle key, marginalia visions, and Seed orb; final "planning her next reentry" image reconfigures premise without stating moral, embracing ambiguity of guarded truths. No thematic echo or sermonizing; resonance from particulars like fusing fragments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with prism-minded perceptual signature (perceiving "hidden layers in ink," "clandestine luminescence"); rhythmic modulation accelerates in sigil chase, breathes in chamber reveal. No dialogue or head-hopping; diction biased toward archival patterns sustains lyric intensity to charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "wall exhaled... peeling apart like pages" advances action, setting, theme); varied rhythm propels via short peak sentences amid lyric swells. Minor overwrite in stacked metaphors during thresholds (e.g., "blade through silk") borders muddle but coheres without obscuring sigil beat or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival quest with physics anomaly (inverted gravity enabling marginalia map) transforms tropes; risk-taking in doodle-as-location revelation feels inevitable from pattern, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Conceptual integrity commits to seeded vigilance without retreat.</comment>
