<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Patience embodied in "knees settled into the permafrost without complaint" and micro-choices like aligning nails to Orion reveal hierarchy of values; final rising with creaking joints shows earned endurance with physical cost, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual patterns densify to plate's glow and subsonic hum; closure via Charged Poise in pulse-map vision and plate-warmed chest reconfigures guidance options with patience's felt cost legible in "joints creaking like old timber."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Permafrost and frost-laced bark constrain ritual (blood sizzles), charging final image where "map alive against her ribs"; sensory hierarchy (silent pulse thick as velvet) mirrors internal rhythm without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to forge pulse-map tightens via blood-seal turning plate radiant, forcing endurance in cold; cost unmistakable in physical toll and foreclosed rush, though subtle under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of revelation from debris emerges organically; final "pulses, not ink—valleys pulsing with hibernating bears" reweights absence into archive with non-literal resonance, inviting ambiguity of beauty/brutality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in pulse/heartbeats diction and rhythmic modulation (slow smoke breaths to subsonic thrum) heighten pressure; stable close-third POV with no elision, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "blood...sizzled faintly against the frost, leaving behind crimson sigils"; minor metaphor density in ritual ("stanza in a silent hymn") borders overwrite but pattern-taught and closure-propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pulse-maps from trash and starlight cipher synthesize fresh alchemy; risk of lyric ritual pays off in "translate heartbeats into maps" inevitability, transforming tropes without gimmick.</comment>
