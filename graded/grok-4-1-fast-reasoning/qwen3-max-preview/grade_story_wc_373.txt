<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's calcified fear into purpose drives micro-choices like feigned stumble and fob deployment, earning final fulfillment; interiority embodied in "fingers curled around the cold brass," revealing heritage without epiphany. Contradictory impulses surface in fear-tempered grace during high-stakes approach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building from failed disguises to fob recognition as Resonant Reconfiguration; closure charged by "brittle snap of trust shattering" in silence, with cost in Chain's flight and Marla's freeze legible on-page. Orientation anchored early in Pier Seven shadows.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy sharpens via POV urgency (creak masks breaths, eels warble cover); micro-setting of stalls and crates constrains stealthy advance, charging final image as pier's "groaning timbers" echo hush break.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thwart deal) signaled early, escalates texturally via failed attempts to fob ploy narrowing options; agency in dangling chain forces recognition, with cost in shattered truce viscerally felt in "hollow click of The Chain’s boot."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of inherited betrayal emerges via fob's memory trigger, reweighting hush truce without statement; final silence offers resonant answer to trust's fragility, charged by "ghost-tick" callback.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature biases toward tidal echoes and relics; rhythmic prose modulates with tension (short sentences in stumble), lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "lanterns swaying like drunken fireflies" advances atmosphere/action); no loops, metaphors coherent and purposeful, propulsion peaks in climax snap without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic-memory as non-violent pivot transforms pirate tropes; fob's "ghost-tick" reprise feels inevitable, risk in quiet closure heightens ingenuity without gimmick.</comment>
