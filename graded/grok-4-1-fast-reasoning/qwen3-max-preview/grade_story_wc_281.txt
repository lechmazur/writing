<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Affectionate skeptic vividly embodied in geode-tracing affection clashing with fear of real voices; contradictory impulses peak in trading doubt for willowglass hope, earning final whisper to Mateo with tearful cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds somatic density to CR closure where studio flares reveal chemical links as artificial; geode's heartbeat-sync charges final image with emotional price of Mateo's warped laugh-memory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Muscovite sliver as micro-setting constrains somatic navigation and pulses as metronome in climax, refracting light into corridors that guide patching and illuminate pathways.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Somatic markers accumulatively escalate from tremors to Mateo's voice, narrowing chemical doubt to fractal endurance; tears in shared memory starfield make emotional cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>CR reweights telepathy premise—"true communion wasn’t chemical"—via somatic patching and glyph-painting; resonance emerges organically from fractured shards to willowglass promises without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct fractal-somatic perceptual signature filters all notice; rhythm compresses under stress in cues like "pulse in her temple," holding POV stability through geode-conducted signal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and integrated metaphors like "frozen lightning"; minor figurative density in peak fractal walls purposeful without obscuring closure flare.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Somatic divination post-pill recall ingeniously transforms telepathy trope into fractal body-compass; risky accumulative lyricism heightens stakes through geode-synced web.</comment>
