<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and micro-choices under storm pressure, with contradictory impulses (tech frustration vs. gestural trust) acting simultaneously in the carving beat; final teaching renunciation earned by slide realization and felt cost of abandoning monetization path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from slide ripples to projection CR, with on-page cost legible in "Simplicity is not absence. It is architecture." whisper and inland walk; orientation anchored early, single scene tightens meaningfully without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Storm-tossed archway and driftwood plank constrain carving choice amid gale, charging final shadow projection; sensory hierarchy (turbine-hum in molars, rain needling scalp) reflects sculptor's tactile bias, evolving causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reimagine alliance simply) signaled early, deepens via slide to carving/projection under Accumulative lens with agency-driven tightening; cost unmistakable in sculpture abandonment and tech renunciation, charging village response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of gestural alliances emerges organically from slide figures to layered carving/projection, offering resonant CR in cliff shadows without moralizing; final image reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of solitary survival foreclosed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (coaxing stories from wreckage, negative space grain); rhythmic modulation peaks in carving reverie, prose texture as sculptor's mind without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion in carving sequence, varied rhythm passes read-aloud; minor figurative density in storm beats purposeful for accumulative tone, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure projection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic slide and driftwood projection transforms salvage tropes into timewoven CR; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight from archway echo.</comment>
