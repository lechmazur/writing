<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's interior tug from duty to empathy is embodied in murmuring stories to ghosts and kneeling with the label, earning his shift to displaying relics; contradictory impulses act in scene via cataloging vs. honoring. Secondary locals apply pressure but remain archetypal without distinction. Final renunciation of expunging feels motivated by prior discoveries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as relic discoveries build density to the display and official confrontation; orientation anchors immediately in ridgeway and resurfacing. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration lands on-page with Elias's reply—“And humanity remembers”—reconfiguring his mandate, cost felt in risked job yielding permanence. No shards or transitions violate scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via surfacing relics dictating the photo trail to gazebo; sensory selection (humid air, mud, indigo sky) reflects Elias's priorities and mirrors memory's emergence. Ridgeway evolves from observation post to shrine site, charging final walks. Body in mud anchors micro-setting for realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expunge vs. honor) signaled early tightens accumulatively through trail to display, forcing confrontation; agency in arranging photos forecloses erasure path. Cost legible in supervisor's frown and crossed arms, resolved by earned reassignment. One deepening suffices, pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory's persistence emerges organically from relics and stories binding strangers to ghosts; final mosaic image resonantly reweights erasure premise without moral statement. Subtext in locals' hush invites reflection on humane defiance. No tidy binary, ambiguity in state's acceptance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in poetic biases (rooftops as knuckles); voice texture modulates from vigilant observation to charged whispers. Brief dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("precisely humane"), advances closure. Rhythmic control heightens pressure in display scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with every line advancing image or stakes; rhythm varies (short punches in confrontations, flowing lists of relics), no loops or scaffolds. Metaphors coherent and purposeful ("knuckles of a drowning man"), propel without overwriting. Closure image sharpened by "growing mosaic."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-town trope via "precisely humane" mandate yielding archivist role; fresh synthesis of resurfacing relics and story-spinning feels inevitable from trail logic. Risk in poetic lyricism heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes, premise commits fully.</comment>
