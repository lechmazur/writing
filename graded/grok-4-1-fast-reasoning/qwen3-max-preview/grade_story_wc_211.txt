<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira's motivation rooted in preservation shifts convincingly to awakening via prophecy, embodied in gasping and trembling fingers; interiority particular through dead languages curse/gift. Micro-choices like playing the cylinder and whispering ancient tongues reveal values under orchard pressure. Minor lack of overt contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: immersion density deepens stake from archive to awaken, culminating in CR closure via orchard hum and petal release with velvet disquiet cost legible in "soft, pervasive, transformative without spectacle." Orientation anchored early; one tightening sufficient. Persistent constraint of emotional patterns shapes tactics to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard garden constrains choice (cylinder played there, trees shiver/respond) and charges final image (roots threading steel, branches reaching). Sensory details selective/POV-biased (moss-wet stone, Etruscan whispers). Micro-setting (petals, cylinder) evolves causally, mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archive emotions) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via prophecy revelation and orchard response, narrowing to awakening agency. Cost felt in subtle city change ("businessman...smiled at a stranger"). Escalation driven by her immersion/playback choices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory/empathy vs. sterilization emerges organically from prophecy, petals, orchard vessel; final image reweights premise non-literally ("orchard hummed on...she would keep speaking"). Subtext in velvet disquiet lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (emotional grooves, dead tongues in static); voice rhythmic/poetic modulates intensity (lyric immersion to terse release). Memory dialogue natural/subtextual (Miko's skeptic whisper). No head-hopping; diction POV-plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, propulsion in syntax variety; no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors ("time like sugar in tea," "petals like slow snow") coherent/pattern-taught. Minor overwriting in orchard descriptors doesn't touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: wax shavings archive emotions, skyscraper orchard ferments them, field-trip prophecy awakens; risk in velvet disquiet tone heightens subtle stakes. No derivative echoes; turns inevitable from particulars.</comment>
