<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shyly unstoppable contradiction acts in scene via fear of audiences yet dawn-climbing to sing, earning endurance at closure; motivation photosynthesizes pain concretely through verses fossilizing in shell walls.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds to Charged Poise closure ("something like rest... in the spaces between her words" with felt cost of insomnia endurance); orientation anchored early in shell post-war; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Shell's spirals constrain choices (innermost ensconcement, ribbed throat climb) and charge final image; postcard as recurring micro-object reweights via warming message; sensory hierarchy poetic/POV-biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (transmute pain to beauty) signaled early, deepens texturally via postcard's "They’re listening" forcing psalm over lullaby; agency in singing crystallizes stance with cost of shy exposure legible in final "began again."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Reef-shadow joy emerges organically from particulars (fossilizing verses, crooked hymns soothing war wounds); final image ("poet smiled... began again") reconfigures transmutation without moral, reweighting pain's persistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (oceanic/floral lyricism: "tide dragging moonlight inland") modulates rhythmically; stable single-POV lyric compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety propels (short punchy finals amid lush layers); high density in peak (postcard warming to psalm); minor figurative density in closure beat but pattern-taught, no loops obscuring image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-war poet in shell photosynthesizing pain via blossom armistice; risk-taking lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
