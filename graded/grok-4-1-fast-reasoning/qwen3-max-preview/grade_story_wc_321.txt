<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Deckhand's resilient positivity and pattern-seeking traits compel consistent micro-choices like tuning the radio by instinct and leaving harmonic beacons, earning the final convergence; interiority concrete via memorized glyphs and embodied vibrations. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in high-pressure scenes like the grotto work, preventing 9+ depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from vanishings to mappings, beacons, and humming convergence (Charged Poise RR with transience cost legible in "permanence was never the goal" line). Orientation anchored early in ferry deck; no shards exceed scope; persistent constraint of patterns shapes tactics to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Spectral grotto's phosphorescent pebbles, pulsing coral, and dripping stalactites constrain choices (e.g., radio discovery, eels tracing equations) and charge final convergence image; sensory hierarchy (ozone, rib-vibrating chord) reflects deckhand's priorities. Micro-setting (hourglass/radio) evolves causally, mirroring internal braiding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (merge timelines for solid world) signaled early, escalates via accumulative deepening: vanishings → radio echoes → pattern mappings → beacons → humming, narrowing options with endurance cost (no sleep, transience acceptance). Agency in harmonic nudges forces stance crystallization; cost felt in fraying inevitability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of pattern-reknit transience emerges organically from ferry oscillations and deckhand's stitching, reweighted in final "patient, permanent transience" image without moralizing; subtext in ghostly ripples and upward sand invites ambiguity on endurance costs. Protagonist arc inextricable from question of solid vs. braided worlds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with sea-textured diction (salt spray, tide breath) and rhythmic modulation under pressure (short sentences in convergence: "The glyphs ignited. The radio emitted a chord"); stable single POV, perceptual bias in glyph-sensing; no dialogue to judge, but captain's silence purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "boots crunching on phosphorescent pebbles, the air thick with ozone and memory" advances setting/action/atmosphere); minor figurative density in grotto beats (liquid starlight, eels orbiting equations) borders overwriting but pattern-taught without muddle. No loops; varied rhythm propels to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum tides, sideways clocks, and harmonic beacons transforms vanishing trope into pattern-braiding ingenuity; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes (fraying certainty), inevitable in hindsight via hourglass reprise; no derivative echoes.</comment>
