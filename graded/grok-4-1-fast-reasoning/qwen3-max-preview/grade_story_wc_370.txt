<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction between past shame and present empathy shown in smoothing the invitation ("creases resisting like scars"), compelling the final stance shift with embodied cost; no unearned epiphanies, traits alter choices organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to Charged Poise closure ("whispered her own name... shelves exhaled"), reconfiguring exile into sanctuary with legible cost in reordered shelves; orientation anchored early, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Library micro-setting constrains via stirring paradoxes and moonlight pool guiding her to center aisle stand; vivid, POV-filtered details like "floorboards creaking only when truth was spoken" charge final image without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of self-confrontation tightens accumulatively through invitation handling to stance crystallization, foreclosing hiding with felt cost in "pressed flat against her chest"; agency in micro-choices narrows options cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of self-forged belonging emerges organically from paradox artifacts to final "Grammar of Forgiveness" drop, offering resonant non-literal answer via charged image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in book-sensing empathy; lyrical diction/rhythm modulates to hushed intensity, prose as character reflects recluse's tranquility without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm, but minor figurative density in reflective beats ("time thinning like old parchment") borders overwriting without obscuring closure; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library paradoxes as self-mirror transforms recluse trope, with risk-taking in textural closure ("reading aloud to empty chairs") heightening stakes inevitably.</comment>
