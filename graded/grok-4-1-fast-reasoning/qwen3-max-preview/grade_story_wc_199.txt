<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation intensifies convincingly from leaf patterns to speck embeddings, with embodied emotions like "moss blooming where her tears touched earth" revealing values under pressure; micro-choices like prodding show contradictory reverence and curiosity acting simultaneously; final transformation earned by cumulative rituals.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from falling leaves to glyphs to grandmother's emergence (RR/CR closure); on-page cost legible in "Elira wept, moss blooming where her tears touched earth," reconfiguring prophecy as unfolding past; orientation anchored early, one tightening via speck suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ashen skyborne arbor vividly constrains choices (gleaning from "dew-cradled bark crevices") and charges final image of "tiny towers... humming with the voices of the forgotten"; sensory details like "scent of charred rye" filtered through Elira's priorities; evolves causally without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode arbor's message) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via speck unspooling lullaby and glyph formation forcing stance shift; agency in prodding/embedding narrows options with felt cost in weeping/transformation; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of past harmonizing through listening emerges organically from monuments and emergence; final image of "sanctuary of echoes" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting folklore without moralizing; subtext in invented names and spectral scents avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature ("mossy delight" as refrain); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, from hushed observation to "knowledge flooded her—not as data, but as scent, texture, song"; brief grandmother dialogue natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering ("thread of silver light that stitched through the air") coherent under lyric voice; rhythm varies, no loops despite "mossy delight" tic (voice-motivated); propulsion strong, minor overwriting in opening doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arboreal memory-weaving transforms folklore tropes via speck unspooling lullabies; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes to conceptual payoff; irreplaceable particulars like dew-glass beads make premise inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
