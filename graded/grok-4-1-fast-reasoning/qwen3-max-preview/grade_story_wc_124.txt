<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in cautious handling yielding to daring vial-opening, embodied in buckling knees and tears; final renunciation of fear earned via glyph revelation. Interiority particular via aromatic lens, no stock epiphanies. Flawless micro-choices under memory pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent release builds density to UV-glyph climax, landing Charged Poise CR where she accepts grief's beauty with emotional cost in "piercing joys' absence as second skin." Orientation anchored instantly; single scene causality tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>Greenhouse's skeletal vines and glass constrain revelation, mirroring loss; UV beam on vapor charges final image, with crystal shadows recurring to reweight memory. Sensory hierarchy aromatic/visual via POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (smell-tears understanding) deepens via inhale-to-UV turn under textural lens, narrowing to stance crystallization; agency in vial/UV choices forecloses fear with legible beauty-pain cost. No reversals needed; pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief guards memory via glyphs' indigo laugh/teal spiral; final "grief...silent lantern-lighter" reconfigures premise non-literally, resonating without moralizing. Particulars like bergamot sob anchor complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable, perceptual signature in scent/glyph bias; rhythmic prose modulates from wistful to revelatory. No elision issues; diction purposeful, lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in glyph description ("curling indigo...jagged sapphire") risks muddle in peak revelation; no loops, metaphors cohere. Read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>UV-revealed memory glyphs synthesize extinction/perfume innovatively, transforming grief trope; lanterns' UV hum as beacons risks bold closure heightening stakes organically.</comment>
