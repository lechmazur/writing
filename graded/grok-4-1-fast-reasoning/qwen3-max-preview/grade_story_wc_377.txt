<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character motivation rooted in preservation trait drives all actions consistently, embodied in tuning rituals and child encounter; interiority concrete via sensory attunement to metal and ice, but lacks dramatized contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from daily rituals to child moment to final echo; on-page CR in "mute figure would appear in the mist—neither ghost nor memory, but echo" reconfigures preservation as perpetual with conceptual cost of personal finitude; orientation anchored early in bluff/sculpture, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting specifics like wind-driven sculpture and iceberg constrain tuning choices and charge final endurance image; sensory hierarchy (vibration for bones, prismatic shadows) filtered through tuner's attuned perception; environment evolves with storms, mirroring internal states purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of wonder preservation signaled early, tightens texturally via child gasp as deepening that tests efficacy; agency in tuning/renunciation forecloses personal vigil path with felt cost in absence; pressure coheres accumulatively without reversal but culminates legibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's fragile hue emerges organically from resonance images, reweighted in final echo without moralizing; child tremor offers non-literal answer to preservation question, charging prior material with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable with perceptual signature in vibration/hue bias; rhythmic prose modulates from descriptive poise to charged closure; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "glistened not from surface shine, but from inner luminescence"); figurative language patterned around resonance without muddle in peak child/echo beats; minor synonym echoes (glisten/shimmer) but purposeful, rhythm varies read-aloud.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bell-tuning as wonder-preservation via salvaged ice/gears transforms isolation trope; risk in elliptical lifecycle arc heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via sculpture's autonomy.</comment>
