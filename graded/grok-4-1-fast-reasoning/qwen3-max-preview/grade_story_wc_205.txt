<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (regrets via shard-rosary vs. breakthrough devotion) act in scene, earning final reframing of revolution with relational cost in Voss collaboration; haiku micro-choices reveal values hierarchy without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of glyph clarity and Voss confirmation builds to CR closure in final haiku/dawn image ("alive... in translation"), reweighting premise with undeniable conceptual cost of past failure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Recurring shard and mirrors constrain choices (veiling enables decoding) and charge final image; chrono-wind and time-streams filter through poetic POV, evolving causally with storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reimagine via glyphs) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via method discovery and Voss scans forcing collaboration; cost legible in wept possibility, charging poise without resolving dispute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final haiku ("We are the answer") offers resonant non-literal answer to forgetting vs. reimagining, reweighting shards/mirrors from prior particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct poetic perceptual signature (dust motes as sonnets, glyphs as ghost-letters) with rhythmic haiku integration; stable single-POV, Voss dialogue subtextual ("You’re not mad") advances goal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors taught early (time as liquid memory); no loops/artifacts, even in reflective peaks—propels to clean closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visible time, mirror-time-echo, haiku-hypothesis inevitable in hindsight; bold sci-fi lyricism transforms revolution trope via shard glyphs without gimmickry.</comment>
