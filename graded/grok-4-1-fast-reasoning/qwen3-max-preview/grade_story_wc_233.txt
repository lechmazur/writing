<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Queen's interiority embodied in bare feet on moss/shale and ragged breath; contradictory impulses between buried name/joy and power choices act in pool scene, earning final renunciation as witness with felt humility cost. Figure applies targeted pressure via pool revelations. Backstory anchors tilt present climb without flattening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dream invitation to firefly path to pool reconfiguration, landing Charged Poise closure ("aura now gentler, woven with sorrow and starlight") with legible conceptual cost of unburying neglect. Orientation anchored early (cliff’s edge, dusk); no disorientation debt. One tightening via fireflies syncing breath narrows to grotto reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy vivid/POV-biased: starlight "bleeding" rivulets constrain climb pause, brambles recoil from commanding presence, ozone/roses thicken air—each charges choices. Grotto ceiling dripping celestial fire mirrors internal neglect, recharging in sealing sigh final image. Spatial choreography coherent up ridge/summit/pool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel dreams) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via fireflies forming path (agency narrows options) and pool scenes deepening knowledge of buried child/self. Pressure coheres to figure's command, forcing renunciation trade-off with emotional cost felt in tears blooming constellations. No coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of neglect vs resonance emerges organically from climb apologies to earth, pool memories, figure's "rule over resonance" counter—final firefly-lace image offers non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in silence/syllables lingers ambiguity of "witness" path. Protagonist arc inextricable from unburying question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (starlight as "nicked" heavens, fireflies "powered" by lungs); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from climb urgency to grotto hush. Dialogue subtextual ("You chose power over pulse"), goal-driven, distinct voices. No head-hopping; elision of child portal paid in pool.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm propulsive, varying lengths breathe with climb tension to grotto cadence; high density integrates sensory/motif without loops (e.g., no paraphrase in revelations). Minor figurative density in opening ("dusk curling fingers") purposeful, not muddling peak pool beat. Clean mechanics, specific verbs ("hissed into steam").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dreams as invitation bleed into real starlight/fireflies syncing biology/authority, transforming disenchanted-queen trope via grotto-memory logic. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmick; final sealing sigh inevitable from particulars.</comment>
