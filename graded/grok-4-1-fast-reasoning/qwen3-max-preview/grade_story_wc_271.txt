<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied trauma via leg twinges and barefoot grounding shows contradictory impulses in the freeze (not fear but stillness), earning the final endurance of presence with felt cost in uncontrolled tears; quietly talented trait constrains noticing as survival tool then creative gift. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("somatic markers") repeated without fresh embodiment slightly dulls peak interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via repeated dawn visits, pattern break at pearl dewdrop reconfigures trauma stake from anchor to compass. Closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in final pulse image with legible conceptual cost (coexistence held without erasure). Orientation anchored early in arboretum arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cliffside arboretum constrains choices (barefoot soil for grounding, bench for tears/sketches) and charges closure (ivy-slats, dewdrop pearl mirroring internal pearl). Sensory hierarchy via POV noticing (moss spirals, gull cries) filters through trauma bias; lighthouse fog etch evolves with sketches.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor optimism amid trauma) signaled early, tightens accumulatively in freeze deepening to pearl realization, forcing trade-off of grief acceptance. Cost visible in tears without control and abandoned sketching reclaimed at price of exposure (leaving drawings). Escalation coherent under Textural lens without need for causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of stillness as eye in chaos emerges organically from particulars (photo jasmine/gunpowder to pulse pearl), final image reweights premise non-literally without moral. Subtext in sister laugh as "frequency tuned to receive" invites ambiguity of joy amid terror; no tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct first-person perceptual signature (spirals in moss, timed gull cries) biases toward tactile patterns, modulating rhythm from fragmented freeze to expansive final pulse. Compression in "held breath beneath ribs" taught early pays off legibly; POV stable, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "paper fibers have memorized my fingers’ tremors" advances character/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, varying sentence openings. Minor overwriting in sustained figurative density ("pearl expands... shell cradling sea") without muddle, but risks coherence in reflective beats; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone trauma recovery via "quietly talented" noticing in decayed arboretum, transforming ruin trope through somatic/pearl reconfigurations. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes of presence-claiming; inevitable hindsight from photo-to-pulse arc.</comment>
