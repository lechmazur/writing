<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mask duality particularizes character and honors discipline vs. mystery, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during pivotal conjuring; endurance feels earned yet unchallenged by opposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increasing to clearings forming and parapet aligning; RR closure via stabilized clearings and satisfied pavilion legible with spent focus cost in "muscles humming"; orientation anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pavilion's petrified vines, sage-ozone scent, and warm stone integrate tactilely, constraining ritual via pulse response; body as micro-setting charges final settling image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve wisdom escalates texturally via thickening resonance and sequential clearings narrowing to surrender; agency in peripheral intent forecloses force with spent focus cost on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of peripheral preservation emerges implicitly from non-forcing ritual and prophet's recalled words; final clearings hovering reweights silence-over-shout without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of murmurs/hums/whispers; rhythmic prose modulates calmly under ritual pressure, distinct texture voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric metaphors, but minor synonym loops in "murmur/hum/whisper/pulse" slightly dull propulsion in peak resonance beat without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of line-walker ritual and psychic clearings transforms preservation trope; risk in lyric accumulative drive heightens stakes via peripheral mechanics.</comment>
