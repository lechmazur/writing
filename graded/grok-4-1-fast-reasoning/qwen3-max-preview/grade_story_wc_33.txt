<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mailman's motivation rooted in linking absences intensifies compellingly to drone launch; interiority concrete in "satchel lighter, but his chest heavier." Minor slip in abstract "quiet calculus of loss and reunion" borders epiphanic without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in final "broken promises... learned to fly." Single scene causality tight, orientation anchored by opening trike ride.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade's power grid and skylight constrain drone launch tactics; twilight's "brittle hush" charges final image of drone vanishing into gloom. Sensory details (ozone, burnt sugar) purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver storm for Lena's daughter) tightens via interceptor risk and storm-mask deepening under Accumulative lens. Agency in reroute/launch forecloses detection path with felt emotional cost at "satchel lighter, chest heavier."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of healing broken promises emerges implicitly via drone's mercy delivery; final image reweights absences as "constellations drawn in ash" without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like Lena's letter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (e.g., parcels as "grief and unanswered questions"); dialogue subtextual and goal-driven in Marla's risk murmur. Rhythmic control modulates to charged poise at launch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varying rhythm; no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in launch beat ("vibrating with trapped lightning") risks slight overwrite but stays legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mailman smuggling bottled storm transforms border trope; thunderstorm's irreplaceable logic heightens stakes organically to "nature’s still the best smuggler."</comment>
