<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Historian's hesitation before breaking the ampoule reveals contradictory impulses between rigid theory and wonder, earning her transformative choice with the felt cost of the statue's dissolution; statue's traits compel its fulfillment without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under accumulative/textural lens, revelations build density to a conceptual repricing closure where the statue's dissolution and light cascade reweight the city's "fall" as evolution, with legible cost in the statue's softening form and final whisper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Underwater garden's kelp, silt, and phosphorescent orchids constrain retrieval and charge the climax as benches crack and murals illuminate; sensory details filter through historian's awe without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rigid narrative vs. nuance tightens via glyph unfolding and ampoule break, forcing agency in shattering with visible cost to statue's preservation; pressure coheres accumulatively to charged poise in her thrum of purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mosaic truth emerges organically through glyph shift ("Shatter certainty") and garden stirring, offering resonant non-literal answer in statue's dissolution without moralizing; final image recharges prior revelations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature of fluid wonder; telepathy integrates cleanly as "incisively kind" pulses, modulating rhythm to match revelatory intensity without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via images like "scalpel dipped in honey"; minor overwriting in opening metaphors slightly dulls early propulsion but spares closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living archive and voluntary dissolution transforms Atlantis trope; risk-taking in accumulative lyricism heightens stakes through garden's animate evolution.</comment>
