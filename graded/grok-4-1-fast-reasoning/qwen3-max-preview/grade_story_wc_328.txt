<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's bitterness flaw drives micro-choices like producing the arrowhead and pressing SEND, earning the unraveling at climax; Moira applies crucible pressure without stealing focus. Interiority embodied in "throat tight" and "weeping into field notebooks" avoids labels. Minor reflection on expedition anchors present but slightly dilutes peak agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to arrowhead vibration as tightening, culminating in on-page RR (phone shatters, tattoo emerges) with conceptual cost of transmuted bitterness legible in "walks lighter than air." Single scene coherent, orientation anchored by garden details in first paragraph. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent vines flicker with hum, constraining climax by dimming and reacting to helix; mandrake roots integrate into metamorphosis, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy (moss smell, gravity-defying teacup) reflects Elara's researcher bias. No white-room; spatial choreography clear as gravity hiccups lift books precisely from shelves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release entity to transform bitterness) signaled via arrowhead; textural escalation via static "language of collapsing stars" narrows to SEND agency, forcing trade-off in "resonance—a tuning of flesh." Cost felt in bitterness "unravel" and shattered phone. One tightening sufficient, no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of harmony reclaiming bitterness emerges via particulars like E-flat humming hikers and final chord harmonizing "soil, root, bone, and void"; Moira's "cosmos...spat it back as confetti" subtextually reweights without moralizing. Final tattoo image offers non-literal answer, recharging arrowhead motif organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in gravitational metaphors ("bent local physics like origami"); dialogue distinct—Moira's reed-like wind vs. Elara's nods. Rhythm modulates to short, punchy climax sentences. No head-hopping; voice poetic yet grounded in tactile details.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density: "syllables of collapsing stars" advances sound, theme, closure in one line. Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; metaphors coherent (origami physics to spiraling helix). Minor overwrite density in opening sensory cascade, but pattern-taught and peak (metamorphosis) clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gravity Dancer via cordless phone/arrowhead synthesizes cryptid lore with physics playfully; "falling upward" turn inevitable from established hum/resonance. Bold risk in textural metamorphosis heightens stakes without gimmick; no template echoes, fully committed premise.</comment>
