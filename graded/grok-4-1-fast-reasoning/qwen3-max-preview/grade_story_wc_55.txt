<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between silence and dream embodied in micro-choices like tracing clefs and striking fork after years; final humming as earned stasis forecloses grand resurrection with visible cost in "no grand composition." Contradictory impulses act on-page, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: crystal droplet and fork harmony tighten density toward RR closure in humming/smiling, reconfiguring dream as transformed; cost legible in "not as its master, but as its witness." Orientation anchored early; lens clear by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal as recurring object constrains placement on chronometer and charges final glow/image, satisfying 9+ test; sensory hush, ticks, brass integrate via actions like polishing/calibrating. Details mirror internal hush without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (peace with dream) signaled early, deepens via crystal/fork interaction forcing stance crystallization; agency in handling crystal/humming forecloses revival path with felt cost under accumulative lens. Escalation subtle but coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of smiling witness reweights silence-to-song transformation non-literally, satisfying 9+ test; theme emerges organically from crystal droplet revelation and hum amid slowing clocks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (whispers, velvet silence, gentle precision); rhythmic diction modulates to charged poise in climax hum, satisfying 9+ test. No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful "bore" motif and varied rhythm; no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (gears as children), propulsion peaks in "single, wavering line of melody." Satisfies 9+ test cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock scribe/crystal hush transforms abandonment trope via petrichor-textured lyricism; risk-taking in accumulative hush-to-hum cadence heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
