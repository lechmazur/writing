<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ghost bride's motivation rooted in twisted devotion compels transmission to Elara with earned change; contradictory love-as-venom acts in gentle placement amid sharp intent. Elara's reaction shows hierarchy of values in whisper of balance, but her interiority borders on epiphanic summary without deeper contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from bead's hum to orchard awakening; CR closure in fruit's bittersweet nectar reconfigures haunting to heritage with legible conceptual cost of eternal infusion. Orientation anchored immediately in greenhouse; single scene tightens meaningfully via bead sync.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse's glass ribs and eternal night constrain perpetual bud, charging final swelling fruit; frost-cracked fields and mandrake ground sensory hierarchy through Elara's steaming tears. Recurrent bead and bark mirror internal states, evolving causally to etched rinds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of debt repayment signaled early tightens accumulatively via bead's resonance unlocking memories, narrowing to transmission with ghost's fading cost. Elara's acceptance forecloses isolation, but lacks micro-agency trade-off to push 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of debt as balance emerges organically from bead's passage and orchard's fruit; final nectar image offers non-literal repricing of vengeance to gift without moralizing. Subtext in silver dust regret layers complexity, inviting ambiguity of curdled love.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person voice stable with perceptual bias toward spectral resonance; syntax modulates rhythmically from drifting cameos to humming panes. Poetic diction purposeful and consistent, heightening pressure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but figurative density borders overwrite in awakening beat ("stems straightened, fruit swelled") without full pattern payoff, dulling peak slightly. No loops; rhythm varies read-aloud, but minor muddle in stacked images like "rusted hinges remembering."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope via alchemical bead and resonant heritage; bead's rune-etched evolution feels inevitable synthesis. Risky lyric compression heightens bittersweet closure without gimmick.</comment>
