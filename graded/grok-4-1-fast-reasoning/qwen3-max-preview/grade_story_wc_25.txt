<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Characterization excels in concrete traits like walk-identification, embodied in boot rhythms and storm-disrupted hearing; micro-choices under pressure, such as pocketing coin despite warmth, reveal calibrated silence. Final renunciation of confrontation earns closure via prior causality. Minor lack of overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: coin discovery to map-following to keyhole presses toward CR closure where "key...meant to open ears" reconfigures premise with conceptual cost of quiet justice over spectacle. Orientation anchors immediately in port labyrinth; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint of silent paths shapes tactics to charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Labyrinth of containers constrains climbs/gaps, charging final gantry overlook; storm's static disrupts walk-perception, mirroring internal calibration. Sensory hierarchy (sounds over visuals) reflects POV expertise. Recurring metal whispers evolve to carry Delgado's confession, recharging closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers via discovery) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via coin/map disruptions narrowing to overhearing; agency in following silent paths forecloses confrontation with felt risk of dark Sector Theta. One tightening via failed key insertion yields reversal to auditory payoff. Entry to 8.8+ gate met but minor abstractness in ethical calculus prevents higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of whispers>shouts emerges organically from silent tracking vs. Delgado's swallowed shouts, culminating in non-literal CR: map-planting as "folded truths." Final image reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like creased constellations avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in auditory bias ("calibrated ears," boot taps); rhythmic prose modulates from steady sway to pulsing coin heartbeat under storm stress. Stable close third-person limited with no leakage; purposeful compression in paths taught early, legible at CR closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "whispers travel farther...in consequence" advances theme/prose); rhythm varies for propulsion, read-aloud ear strong. Minor patterned repetition of "whispers/shouts" purposeful, not loop; no artifacts dulling closure image of refolded map.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis: zodiac coin/map as auditory key transforms port-maze trope into proof of silent power; twist on "key with no apparent lock" inevitable from folded maps motif. Risky lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes via storm-disrupted senses without gimmickry.</comment>
