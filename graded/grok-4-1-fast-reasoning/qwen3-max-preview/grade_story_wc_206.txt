<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Solo repairman's guilt embodied in trembling hands and aching teeth drives micro-choices like singing the lullaby; past lie flaw confronts cost in wilting stone, earning redemption without tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from wilting chip to resonant song, landing charged poise closure as light unmakes shadows with felt emotional cost in final weep; single scene oriented early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Resonance chamber's copper pipes and glass bells constrain climax by vibrating sympathetically to song, charging final swirling light; sensory details filter through repairman's tinkering bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to reclaim light tightens texturally via wilting stone narrowing to truthful song, forcing trade-off with guilt; agency in tethering peaks as shadows recoil, cost in carried song legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature of mechanical lullabies holds stable third-limited POV; rhythm modulates from hum to blaze without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but figurative density edges overwriting in opening polish-chime buildup without obscuring peak clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Covenant of rust transforms decay into truth-revelation with fresh synthesis of philosopher's stone and tinkersong, risking lyric fantasy payoff in dancer's haze-arm.</comment>
