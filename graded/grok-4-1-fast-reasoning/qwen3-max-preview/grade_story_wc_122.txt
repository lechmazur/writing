<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shines in embodied sensations like "vibrations trembling up her spine," rooting motivation in consistent traits; fear of numbness compels the rigging of the needle, earning her change. Contradictory impulses act in the climax as she presses on despite skips. Final endurance of the void as "potential" forecloses hollow isolation with felt cost. Students' reactions reveal her influence without stealing focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from numbness to rupture via needle discovery and backward play; orientation anchors early in cavern and seasons. One tightening: glitch forces exposure of seams, reweighting stakes. Closure as Charged Poise in "She signed to her students: 'Again'" lands on-page with legible cost of provoked presence. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cavern's "cedar staves curved like ribs" and "resin and burnt sage" constrain via sympathetic resonance of drums in climax. Sensory hierarchy favors tactile/vibrational bias, mirroring Elara's priorities. Recurring drums and needle charge final image, guiding choices like rigging. Details evolve causally, no white-room or checklists.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of defeating numbness signaled early, tightens via backward song's "rupture" narrowing to exposed pain. Agency in cranking and persisting through glitches forecloses soothing path with writhing cost. Under Accumulative lens, density reweights to luminous silence. Escalation driven by her choices, cost unmistakable in students' sobs and laughs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of inverted silence facing numbness emerges organically from glitch gasps and thickened filament, no statements. Final "world, reversed, ready to be felt" reconfigures hush as resilient without moral. Subtext in contagion enthralls via implication. Complexity lingers in pain's exposure, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in vibration/textural noticing like "dust motes danced"; rhythmic control heightens pressure in stuttered skips. Stable single-POV limited, no leakage. Lyrical compression taught early pays off at closure. Voice modulates from muted void to radiant hush seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "melodies inverted into question marks"; varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds. Figuratives purposeful and consistent, no muddle in peak "rupture" beat. Precise verbs and concrete images advance all layers. Read-aloud ear flows naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deaf vibration-sense with backward Bach glitches transforms therapy trope into tactile ritual. Needle's evolution from useless to relic risks bold lyricism, heightening stakes coherently. No derivative echoes; premise feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
