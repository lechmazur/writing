<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's embodied dread (molars aching, clawing at chest) and contradictory impulses culminate in earned unbosoming choice, revealing values hierarchy with memory-extraction cost. Advisor applies targeted pressure without overshadowing single-POV interiority. Voice-specific flaws persist to closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through funhouse progression to CR closure ("Fear’s weakness… a reflection, not a ruler"), with legible cost in dissolving replica-self. Single continuous scene adheres to defaults; orientation anchored early via post-resuscitation funhouse entry. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Funhouse mirrors constrain climax by reflecting cursed dread, charging final image as protagonist exits unburdened. Sensory selectivity (mildew, reverse lullaby) mirrors internal panic, evolving causally with shattering glass.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trick fear) signaled early tightens accumulatively via dictionary reading to unbosoming reversal, narrowing to self-confrontation with glowing-memories cost. Agency in thrusting echoes at replica forecloses hunted path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of fear-as-reflection emerges organically via mirrors/memories, resonant CR in replica's horrified "You’re… me" reweighting premise without moralizing. Particulars (luminance burning recognition) avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (film-negative memories, phantom light) stable in first-person; rhythm modulates from slithering vibrations to sighing stillness. Sparse dialogue subtextual, advancing via advisor's skull-echo urgings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "letters melting like candle wax"), varied rhythm; minor figurative density in climax metaphors consistent with luminance pattern, no loops obscuring closure. Read-aloud ear clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of funhouse surrealism and self-as-fear CR transforms tropes via cursed snapshots; risk in metaphorical chest-plunging heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from early luminance seed.</comment>
