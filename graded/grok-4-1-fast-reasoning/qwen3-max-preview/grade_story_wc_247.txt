<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to translate silence into music drives consistent micro-choices like signing and framing with the camera; joyful sorrow embodies contradiction without therapy-speak. Silas applies relational pressure effectively as advisor. Girl's response earns a subtle change, but lacks deeper internal flaws complicating peak teaching moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build in gestures and presences toward Charged Poise closure; "music... remembered by no one tomorrow" delivers legible conceptual cost in final image. Single scene coherent, no orientation debt. Micro-turn with girl's arrival tightens resonance without causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Harbor's moonlight, waves, and wind constrain and charge actions as concert hall; "curve of a wave became a crescendo" integrates sensory hierarchy via Elara's perceptual bias, mirroring internal states purposefully. Spatial choreography clear on pier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translation signaled early escalates accumulatively via fisherman pause and girl's signing response, narrowing to ephemeral cost. Agency in teaching forecloses remembrance path with felt price under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-canvas emerges from sign motifs and final echo image, reweighting premise without statement; "joyful sorrow of creation" layers ambiguity organically. Resonant non-literal close in "forever be felt."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in vibrational framing; voice modulates rhythmically, diction poetic yet legible. Minimal dialogue natural, subtext-laden in Silas's whisper-sign hybrid.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene breath, high density in image-actions like "fingers curling like petals"; minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but coheres without muddle or loops at closure. Propulsion clean to final echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sign-as-composition transforms silence trope via camera-framing vibrations; risk-taking in lyric accumulative drive heightens ephemeral stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
