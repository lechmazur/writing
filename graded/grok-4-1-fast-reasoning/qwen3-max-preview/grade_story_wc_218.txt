<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete in bird-freeing moment ("sat cross-legged, gently systematic"), revealing hierarchy of values without epiphany; final endurance earned by consistent traits, with death as felt cost of refusal to decay.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of examples builds to closure RR at "a sigh lost in the rustle of leaves," reconfiguring fear into harmony with legible life-cost; orientation anchored early, no shards beyond defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via pillars/orchard symbiosis guiding remodel choices; copper-warmed branches charge lizard-sunning image and final coil-hand rest, mirroring internal states tactilely.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (remodel for respect) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through bird/sparrow examples to final-month tightening that crystallizes endurance; cost visible in shallow breath on stair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of collaborative architecture emerges via particulars like Whisper Arch bees; final raccoon image offers non-literal resonance to interspecies question, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (conversations with mycelium/wind); rhythmic prose modulates calmly under death-stakes, diction biased toward botanical intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density in dawn-mist lines advances character/atmosphere without loops; varied rhythm propels to "pulse fading into earth," zero artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Copper-as-intention-conductor transforms trope of dying wish into fresh synthesis; risk in absurd method heightens ingenuity, inevitable at folklore legacy.</comment>
