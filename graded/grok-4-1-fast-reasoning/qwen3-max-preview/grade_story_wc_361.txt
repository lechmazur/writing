<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in mentor's absence compel the path choice and pendant release; contradictory impulses subtle in hesitation before sharing with child. Minor lack of deeper flaws limits to very strong, but change earned with visible cost in emptiness at end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds vibrations/resonance to CR closure in pendant release dissolving into aurora, reweighting routine to myth with conceptual cost of personal loss legible in "empty-handed, humming." Orientation anchored early; single-shard scope fits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pendant as micro-setting constrains choices (path fork, sharing) and charges final image; sensory details (frost crunch, lantern sway) filtered through courier's attuned perception integrate purposefully. Aurora glyphs and market canopy evolve causally with emotional arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax wonder vs. routine/delivery) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via market detour and child encounter narrowing to release; agency in micro-choices forecloses efficiency with felt cost in heavier casket and final emptiness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of cultivated wonder emerges organically from particulars like pendant visions and child whisper, reweighted in final image of seeding legends without moralizing; resonant CR answers routine-to-myth question via release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (vibrations as song/lullaby) modulates rhythmically under rising resonance; stable single POV, minimal dialogue natural/subtextual in child's "It remembers." No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and purposeful metaphors (e.g., "wonder spilled through" cracks routine) propel without loops; minor figurative density in opening fits taught lyric pattern, no artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic delivery with vibration-attuned wonder transforms fantasy tropes via specific pendant mechanics and memory-to-myth fade; risk-taking in lyric closure heightens stakes organically.</comment>
