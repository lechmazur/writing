<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied perception and endurance in vigil, with motivation rooted in covenant; micro-choices like shielding the box reveal values. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure, leaning toward serene stasis over dynamic internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in the ghost's gaze and bow; cost legible in "surrender to oblivion" if opened. Orientation anchored early in oasis; no shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stained glass box as micro-setting constrains core choice (never opened) and charges final honey-gold glyphs image. Sensory details selective via POV (dust on frames, phantom pollen), mirroring silence's weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve silence vs. release) signaled early, tightens texturally via brighter dusk ghosts and storm endurance. Final gaze exchange crystallizes stance with felt cost of isolation; one deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence as sanctuary emerges organically from ghosts' clues and box's weight; final bow and glyphs offer non-literal resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature ("reading the air like scripture"); rhythmic diction modulates serenely, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion; metaphors cohere (hive hum, light glyphs) without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops on silence/ghosts (-0.4), but don't dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghosts as archival silence in beekeeping ruin; risk-taking in lyric endurance heightens thematic stakes, transforming spectral trope via covenant's weight.</comment>
