<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied grief (tears tracing cheeks) and micro-choices under pressure (palm on bench triggering vision); final unfolding earned by causal buildup from background traits without unearned epiphanies. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. determination) act simultaneously in the terrace scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflective density builds to CR closure (stepping off as reconfiguration of time/maze with sacrifice cost in "dissolving into light"); orientation anchored early (Elara on terrace post-butterfly effect); one tightening via wood vision to logbook scrawl pays off without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism terrace and bench grain constrain choices (tracing for chronology triggers vision, rim enables step-off) and charge final image (mist curls like fingers); sensory hierarchy POV-specific (spectral light measures distances).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sacred thresholds via reunion) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through deepening realizations narrowing to agency in step-off; cost legible in "willingly left behind" and final dissolution under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of sacred thresholds via sacrifice emerges organically from particulars (maze keystone, bench grief); final image (maze glowing below) offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting distance/loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (grain as chronology, thresholds as echoes); rhythmic lyric voice modulates intensity, consistent diction under stress without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (rainbow mist, folded silence) taught early; no loops or scaffolds, propulsion via varied rhythm to charged final creak; minor density in metaphors doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corn mazes as reality anchors, wood-grain chronology, time-as-maze; risk-taking in CR closure heightens stakes via irreplaceable premise transformation.</comment>
