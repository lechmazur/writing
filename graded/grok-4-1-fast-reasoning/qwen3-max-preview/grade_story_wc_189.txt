<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied (chill climbing wrist, vibrations in molars); contradictory impulses act in accepting companion's interruption of solitude. Final shared pause earned by prior relational pressure. Minor reflection slightly abstracts peak motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of impressions builds to Charged Poise closure in shared pause, with felt cost of foreclosed rush/resistance. Anchored early (chronicler at starlit pool). No orientation debt; lens unambiguous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy reflects POV (tidal sighs, barnacle tremors, salt-moss scent); grotto constrains via interrupting shadow at entrance. Jade cicada charges final image as compass. Environment mirrors internal flux purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of time amid migration argument) signaled early, deepens texturally via companion's hesitant arrival narrowing to shared liminal stance. One tightening forecloses resistance; cost legible in exhaled echo pulling back like tide.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacred transitions emerges organically from cicada metaphor, threshold impressions, and final shared pause reweighting roots vs migration without moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer in "tide turned."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature (textures over facts: "sigh of receding foam"); rhythmic modulation under insight (short impressions vs longer breaths). Dialogue sparse, natural, subtextual ("You don’t have to decide tonight").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (metronomic drips to flickering impressions); no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful (moonlight as memory shards) without muddle in peak (cicada pulse). Propulsion aligns with textural cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal observation as time-texture method, cicada as transition relic transforming introspection trope. Risky lyric accumulation heightens liminal stakes organically.</comment>
