<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular in quill-dipping reverence, earning shift from past failures to invitations; embodied tension in hovering fingers and inhaled mist, though occasional abstract epiphanies like "future is not conquered but coaxed" slightly generalize emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as descriptive density builds to glyph-activated hum and spire pulse (Charged Poise closure); orientation anchored early in spire summit and dawn ritual; conceptual cost legible in "maps would be misread... that was the point," reconfiguring possibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Obsidian spire, frozen lake groan, and modified-flax parchment constrain writing choices and charge final pulse; sensory hierarchy (glacial mist, ice shift) reflects cartographer's priorities; micro-setting (quill, inkwell) evolves tactilely to hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seed innovation in constraint) tightens via past-failure reflection to on-page glyph-writing agency; Accumulative deepening reweights options with permeability cost; pressure coheres without reversal mandate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of coaxed transformation emerges organically from constraint-friction particulars, resonating in final "Begin." glyph without moralizing; invitations subtextually reweight ignorance maps, inviting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (equations as roots, glyphs from lichen) biases noticing; rhythmic prose modulates from meditative hover to resonant hum; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels from pregnant pause to spire pulse; minor figurative density in glyph beats risks overwrite but stays voice-consistent; no loops, clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ignorance-mapping and predictive glyphs transforms innovation trope; risk-taking in lichen-derived script and meteorite ink heightens conceptual stakes organically.</comment>
