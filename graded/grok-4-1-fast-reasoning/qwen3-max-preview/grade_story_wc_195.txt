<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Knight's motivation rooted in allegiance drives surrender to patterns, embodied in "joints unsnapped—not broken, but liberated," earning change from withdrawn to unfolded. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for 9+ test. Strong micro-choices reveal values under environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from kneeling to vortex descent, delivering Charged Poise RR in threads harmonizing knight to cosmos with surrender cost legible in "organic surrender." Orientation anchored early in orchard. Closure image reconfigures stance indelibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Alchemical details like "mercury-root and phosphor-bark" constrain and charge via responsive vines/fruit silhouettes mirroring internal shift, culminating in soil that "sings" underfoot. Sensory integration purposeful, POV-filtered through knight's liminal gaze. Environment evolves causally, pressuring climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake to capture possibility escalates via textural density in sequences narrowing control to harmonization; agency in patterns forces trade-off of self into conduit. Cost unmistakable in final "unfolded" walk with threads remaining. Lens-driven tightening coherent to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of liminal surrender emerges organically from unsnapping and threads, reweighting certainty via "new grammar of becoming" without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal answer, charging prior allegiance with conceptual cost. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in mystical notices like "air itself tasted of dissolved time." Rhythmic control modulates to bliss in climax laughter "like thawing ice." No elision issues; voice embodies knight's unfolding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax, but figurative stacks like "frost and flame entwined" border overwriting in rising beats without obscuring closure. No loops; propulsion peaks in vortex image. Rhythmic ear test passes with purposeful lyric cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knight archetype via alchemical puppetry transforms tropes into "conduit" premise, risking bold poetic structure that heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight in patterns remembering him. No derivatives; vision authentic.</comment>
