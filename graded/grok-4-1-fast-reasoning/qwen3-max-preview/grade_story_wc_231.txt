<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eccentric keeper's interiority shines in "let the Edelweiss brush his collarbone, and wait for the gap to speak," revealing contradictory impulses of persistence versus isolation; final choice to withhold findings feels earned through nightly rituals with visible cost of solitary watch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density building to CR closure in lantern lighting "guiding no ships tonight—only ghosts," reweighting borrowed memories with conceptual cost of unreported truths; orientation anchored early at dock, one tightening via fourth-night revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist-shrouded opal dock constrains ritual pauses and charges final image; sensory hierarchy (crackle of flower, indigo sky) filters through Silas's perceptual bias, mirroring internal echoes without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to decode gesture tightens texturally on fourth night, narrowing knowledge with agency in observation; cost legible in non-reporting renunciation, though slightly abstract until lantern image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Borrowed memories theme emerges organically from flower shard and photo pinning, offering resonant CR in Edelweiss as "testament to softly persistent love"; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in planned deaths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with distinct perceptual signature ("gaps between waves, the pause before gulls cry"); rhythmic modulation peaks in revelation shard, purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via integrated images like "mist thickened like breath held too long"; figurative density risks overwriting in opening but coheres without muddle at revelation or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory inheritance via residue transforms ghost story tropes; risk-taking in textural drive and CR closure ("some truths belong to the sea") feels inevitable, heightening isolation stakes.</comment>
