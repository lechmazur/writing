<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silas's symphonically minded trait roots motivation in concrete listening and carving micro-choices, culminating in earned reconfiguration where trees sculpt him; embodied tears mark felt cost of prior isolation without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silence density breaks via insulator discovery → analysis → carving → strum, yielding RR closure in grove awakening with legible recognition cost: "tears tracking slow paths... from recognition"; orientation anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grove's roots, bark, frost constrain carving choice and charge final image where "roots drummed underground"; sensory hierarchy (sap-rush, wind-hush) filters through sculptor's musical bias without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence vs. resonance) signaled early tightens via insulator deepening, forcing endurance of absence until agency-driven strum forecloses isolation with tears as on-page cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-potential emerges organically from fracture-to-song arc, final image reweighting imposition to reciprocity without moralizing; "from crack to chord, from grief to grace" resonates via particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of musical metaphors (sap-rush melodies); rhythmic control modulates from hollow silence to humming expectancy, elisions taught early as intentional pauses.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels with varied rhythm, but figurative density in carving beat ("river deltas of sorrow") borders overwriting without muddle; no loops, clear syntax supports quiet intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tree-song sculptor premise synthesizes nature/music/porcelain fractures into fresh lyric arc; risk of poetic compression pays off in charged closure without gimmickry.</comment>
