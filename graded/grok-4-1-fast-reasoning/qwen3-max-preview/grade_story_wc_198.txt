<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in family prophecy clear and intensifies through embodied adjustments like shifting embouchure; interiority concrete via muscle memory and spine-cold pressure. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for deeper conflict before success. Final endurance earned but without raw flaw confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from notes curling silence to prophecy stirring/resisting, culminating in on-page Resonant Reconfiguration as prism shatters silently with felt cost in lingering memory. Orientation anchored early ("stone met sky," grotto/prism). Closure image of empty space reconfigures options indelibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto/prism/dewdrops constrain choices, pulsing in rhythm and pausing mid-fall to charge climax; sensory hierarchy musical/misty filters through POV. Final dewdrop as micro-setting recharges hush, mirroring internal hush. Vivid integration without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) signaled early, escalates via density tightening—fog swirls, prophecy pressures ribs—under Accumulative lens, narrowing to softened attack trade-off. Prophecy resistance forces micro-turn; cost legible in unraveling without residue, felt in memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hushing deadly echoes through beauty emerges organically from melody vs. prophecy friction; final dewdrop image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting silence as fragile cost. Nostalgic memories interweave without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in musical negative space and mist textures; voice rhythmic, modulating from gravity-bending phrases to whisper-fading close. Compression taught early, legible at prism sigh.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax mirroring melody; purposeful hush/negative space pattern avoids loops. Minor figurative density in climax ("ink in milk," "glass beads") risks slight muddle but coheres in lyric mode without obscuring closure dewdrop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of saxophonist as prophecy-husher in responsive grotto transforms musician trope via code/memory stakes; eerie hush/prism shatter feels inevitable, bold lyric risk heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
