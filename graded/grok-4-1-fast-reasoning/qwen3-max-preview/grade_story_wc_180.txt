<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in throat tightening at daughter's vow yet grinning at its feistiness compel persistence; final endurance earned through micro-choices like honey spoon, foreclosing easy retrieval with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as vow-gathering density tightens to recoiling branch and dream shard; charged poise closure in footprints/green scrap reconfigures stance with undeniable cost of partial return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orchard rafters constrain climb and vow retrieval (recoiling branch forces honey tactic); final rose thorn/footprints charge image, mirroring internal repair via tactile integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (generational bridge) deepens accumulatively via daughter's stubborn vow narrowing options; agency in unorthodox tools forces trade-off, with throat-tighten cost charging footprints poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Repair-over-redemption emerges organically from vow-mending to ribbon stitching; final green scrap laughter offers resonant CR reweighting persistence without moral, lingering ambiguity intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (lens-polished vows as repair objects) with rhythmic modulation in swelling hum; voice specificity heightens under pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated action/image (honey-coated spoon adheres vow); minor figurative density coherent in orchard pattern, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mender's tools/vow orchard transforms estrangement trope; risk in lyric accumulative pattern inevitable via stubborn branch payoff heightens stakes organically.</comment>
