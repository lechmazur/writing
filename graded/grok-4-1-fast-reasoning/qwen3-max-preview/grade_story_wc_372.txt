<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira's motivation as existential archivist drives precise micro-choices like "feather precision" adjustments, embodied in frozen tears during the forgiveness vow; gentle competence balances with awe's disruption, earning her final carriage of frequencies in marrow, though internal contradictions act more sequentially than simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds vow-by-vow to forgiveness vow's recalibration, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure as slide dims "purpose fulfilled," with legible conceptual cost in oblivion defied and her whispered "You are remembered"; orientation anchored in first paragraph, no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen library's rime-glazed shelves and groaning ice constrain swift work and fog lenses, charging final image with twilight shaft piercing dome off silent slide; selective sensory hierarchy (whispering boots, fogged breath) reflects Elira's reverence without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to measure fading vows before oblivion tightens texturally via each vow's emotional deepening, culminating in pure forgiveness resonance forcing awe-struck recalibration; agency in her endurance forecloses slide's magic with felt cost as it dims entirely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of conjuring meaning emerges organically from vow particulars ("I forgive you" purest), reweighting oblivion premise in final resonant image of glowing vow and library exhale without moralizing; no tidy resolution, ambiguity in her onward smile lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature of calibrated reverence ("pendulum calibrated to reverence"); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates from hush to warmer air, compression purposeful and legible under Accumulative lens, no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "needle dancing across frequency graph" advances action/atmosphere); rhythmic variety in read-aloud, minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "auroras trapped in glass" coherent but dense without muddle; no loops, scaffold, or artifacts dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival fantasy with frequency-measured emotions transforms trope via harmonic vows defying entropy; risk in lyric Accumulative drive pays off in inevitable-feeling CR closure, no derivative templates.</comment>
