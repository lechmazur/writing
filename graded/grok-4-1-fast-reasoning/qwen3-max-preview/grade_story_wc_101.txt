<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira's motivation rooted in intergenerational support drives consistent actions like midnight runs, revealed through embodied details (tracing bell, carrying baskets uphill); micro-choices under sanctions pressure (not ringing bell) show value hierarchy with endurance cost. Internal conflict subtle but present in anonymity vs. invitation tension. No strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak scene limits 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solo runs to communal adoption via note, others joining, gathering speech. Closure as Charged Poise in bell rung + new baskets reconfigures individual to shared covenant with felt cost of passing torch ("waiting...for a successor"). Orientation anchored early (arbor, ridge, twilight, sanctions); pattern taught pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Arbor as micro-setting anchors and charges closure (chapel/archive, final table/waiting); sensory details (frost feathered ridge, breath mist, gravel footsteps) selective via Elira's priorities, evolve with deepening night/sanctions. Details constrain (reed baskets, uphill dark) and mirror persistence. 9+ gate met: arbor shapes final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sustain community vs. sanctions fracture) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via note/others joining/bell rung, narrowing to communal invitation with endurance cost (dark runs, potential exposure). Agency in persistence/ speech forecloses solo path. One tightening sufficient; live trade-off in anonymity's spell.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of anonymity as resilient covenant emerges organically from bell motif (silent promise → rung vow), food runs, gathering; final image (Elira walks into dark, bell waits) offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting individual to intergenerational weave without moralizing. Subtext in silence, notes, nods lingers with ambiguity. 9+ test: reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-close POV stable, perceptual signature lyrical/particular (worn bell surface, rustle of loaves); voice texture modulates with quiet intensity, diction biased to Elira's hopeful persistence. Speech natural/subtextual ("This doesn’t belong to me"), advances invitation. No head-hopping; rhythmic control under pressure clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm/syntax mirroring quiet persistence; metaphors coherent (frost feathers, breath mist) without muddle in peaks. Minor paraphrase loops (baskets repeated) purposeful for accumulative pattern, not scaffold. Zero artifacts dulling closure image; read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sanctions resistance via anonymous bell/food runs transforms charity trope into covenant invitation, with ridge/arbor grounding emotional specificity. Risk in lyric accumulative quiet ending heightens stakes; no derivative templates, inevitable in hindsight via motif evolution.</comment>
