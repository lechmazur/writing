<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via pressing dead button for resonance despite knowing better than to name strangers; final renunciation of holding in place earned by spatial attunement with felt cost in dissolution. Interiority concrete and particular, embodied in thumbing worn plastic and bone-vibrating hum. No safety-hedging; flaw of anxious clinging confronts via micro-choice to offer without touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from pulsing caps to shimmering air and motes sinking into soil, culminating in CR of "physics of letting go" as expansion. Orientation anchored in first line (Aris in mushroom farm pre-dawn). Closure cost legible in "no longer a relic, but a key" clicking softly, reconfiguring permissions with undeniable emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mushroom caps and soil constrain choices, dimming with intent and feeding dissolved motes to charge final image of glowing pulse. Sensory hierarchy spatial/POV-biased: glow as geometry only she interprets. Micro-setting (laser button, trellis) tactile and lived-in, mirroring internal permeability without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (letting go) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via brighter pulses to resonance/shimmer narrowing to non-touch alignment. Agency in walking/offering forecloses holding path with cost felt in stranger's dissolution. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise in exhale and attunement; no coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: grief via button/mother mist to boundaries honored, final image resonantly reweights as "act of expansion" without moral. Subtext in peripheral watchers' sorrow implies complexity; epiphany earned through shimmer/fold. No tidy binary, lingers in luminous unknown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in spatial diction ("curvature of rooms," "pressure gradients," "space folded"); rhythmic control modulates from indigo silence to harmonic hum under rising glow-pressure. Stable close-third POV, no leakage; compression purposeful and taught early as lyric pattern payoff in motes swirl.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture/pressure (e.g., "glow swelling like slow heartbeats" integrates sense/action). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; figurative coherence in dissolution images ("chalk on wet pavement," "motes of dust") without muddle, even in peak shimmer beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spatial gift + fungal anchors transforms dimensional grief into "physics of letting go," inevitable in hindsight via permeable motif. Bold lyric risk in quiet dissolution heightens stakes without gimmick; no template echoes, fully commits to premise implications.</comment>
