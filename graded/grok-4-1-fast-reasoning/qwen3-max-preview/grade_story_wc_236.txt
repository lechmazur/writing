<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion in sensory loss and fraud conflict, with micro-choices like handling the screw revealing values; internal contradiction acts in scene via seeking revelation despite doubt. Minor slip in direct "feel like a fraud" phrasing borders diagnostic, but doesn't touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to CR closure in clock mounting and final table placement, reweighting self-doubt with cost of endured loss legible in "silence a hymn." Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shop's brass, drip, fog constrain revelation via tools and mirror Elara's occluded senses; recurring broken clock charges final image as relic. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific, selective for touch/sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fraud vs. presence deepens accumulatively through Ren's fulcrum reading and screw mounting, narrowing to endurance with felt cost in sensory permanence. Agency in seeking/bowing forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of ordinary miracles emerges via particulars like screw/clock, resonant in final image reweighting premise without moral; subtext in pauses implies presence over scent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature touch/sound-biased; dialogue subtextual ("selling presence") advances stakes. Rhythmic control modulates from hush to chime.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric metaphors (fog softening outlines) taught early; no loops, varied rhythm propels to closure image. Minor figurative density in peak reflection but coherent for lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aromatherapy loss, birthing screw in clock transforms revelation trope; risk in textured lyricism heightens emotional specificity without gimmick.</comment>
