<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in frayed conviction versus return to altar earn the palm-press seal as pivotal micro-choice with embodied cost in "flawed beauty of a heart still willing to try." Interiority concrete via thumb-tracing grooves; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density tightening from preparation to signing under moons; Charged Poise closure reconfigures peace as pulse with cost legible in "for the first time... mustered" and dawn smile. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one meaningful cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Terrace's volcanic stone and priest dais constrain ritual choice, charging final lift into moonlight; sensory hierarchy (dusty boots, burnt sage) reflects negotiator's priorities. Micro-setting as altar integrates into action without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mustering conviction escalates accumulatively via ink-vial to thumb-mosaic tightening; agency in ritual writing forecloses failure-path with cost in "buried too many compromises." One deepening reweights under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of peace-as-pulse emerges organically from particulars like scratched-out names shifting to mosaic; final smile offers non-literal resonance reweighting "hollow words into binding rhythm" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "operatively gentle cadence" modulates with intensity; stable limited POV biases details to negotiator's frayed resolve. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual in "not a treaty... a mirror."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor figurative density ("slow unfurling... beneath her ribs") borders overwriting in prep beat without obscuring closure. No loops; propulsion aligns with accumulative rise to dawn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ritual resurrection of oaths transforms peace-negotiation trope via iridescent ink and thumb-prints; fresh synthesis feels inevitable in mosaic consent image, risking lyric poise payoff.</comment>
