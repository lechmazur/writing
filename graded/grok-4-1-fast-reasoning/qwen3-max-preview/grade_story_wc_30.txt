<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses from moon phases act vividly in her wax/wane self-doubt during the ritual; final soul-smile renunciation of rigid certainty earned by prior causal immersion, with embodied cost in blurring edges.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of images builds to RR closure in shelving and stepping forward; cost legible in "certainty soften... from wisdom" as she forecloses unyielding archiving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tidal pool and algae constrain ritual choice by providing solvent for smelting; recurring creel and dome charge final hush image, with POV bias in lunar spectacles sharpening mundane magic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake to preserve wonder tightens via pool immersion that forces contradiction-acceptance; agency in lowering/withdrawing creel drives deepening, cost felt in self-softening under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wonder's migration emerges organically from ritual particulars; final "wonder doesn’t die—it molts, it moves" reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Consistent lyrical perceptual signature via myth-mechanical whispers; rhythmic syntax modulates serene intensity, POV stable without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm propels with varied openings despite dense figures; figurative layering purposeful in accumulative mode but borders overwriting in creel-tremble beat, no loops obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical-mythic librarian smelting migratory souls via creel transforms preservation trope; risk in surreal logic heightens stakes coherently to inevitable close.</comment>
