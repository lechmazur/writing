<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied, with trembling fingers and chest warmth showing release; contradictory impulses in forgiving betrayal earn the hairpin choice with visible cost of refusing sorrow's definition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reflective density builds to Charged Poise closure in hairpin slide and deep smile; cost legible in "weight of release" reconfiguring soul's shape on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto's moss-hung silence and petrichor constrain reflection and charge final image, mirroring internal softening; micro-setting (stone bench, hairpin glint) anchors tactile choices without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (contentment post-betrayal) signaled early, tightens via breeze realization narrowing grief into grace; agency in hairpin placement forecloses wound's dominance with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Forgiveness-as-rebirth emerges organically from scalloping metaphor and hairpin reprise, resonant in valley view without moralizing; final image reweights cycle as daily climb, embracing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close stable with perceptual bias (tree as sanctuary); rhythmic diction modulates from ascent tension to hushed poise, perceptual signature in "vineyard hush" texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("wine settling... leaf in still water") slightly dulls mid-beats; no loops touch closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Scallop" transforms grief into grace via fresh embodied metaphor; hairpin's ivy filigree and childhood tree parallel synthesize rebirth uniquely, risking lyric over plot without gimmick.</comment>
