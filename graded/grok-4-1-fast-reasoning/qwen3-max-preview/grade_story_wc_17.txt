<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices (trembling fingers, sketching echoes) reveal motivation rooted in forgiveness-seeking; earns purpose-clarifying change at close. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats, leaning idealized without blind-spot mistakes compounding pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from sigh/sob to diaries discovery mirroring her mapping, yielding Charged Poise CR: walls' recognition reconfigures legacy premise with heavier heart cost legible in "satchel lighter, her heart heavier."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage and body-as-micro-setting (palm on flagstone, ribs listening) constrain perception/actions and charge final exhale rustle; selective sensory hierarchy reflects POV urgency, evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (walls' dreams) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via diaries' parallel ache-mapping, narrowing to witness/leave choice with emotional cost in heavier heart; coherent pressure without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Legacy burden emerges organically from diaries fragments and her sketch-left-behind, final image ("secret whispered into the ear of stone") resonantly reweights without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on forgiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (vibrations in bones, sighs in mortar); rhythmic syntax modulates intensity, diction biased toward stone-life metaphors taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propulsion with varied rhythm, integrated figures (moonlight "sharp as a scalpel") coherent and sparse; no loops, scaffolds, or overwriting dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-climate echo-cartography transforms memory tropes via walls-dreaming premise; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens thematic stakes organically.</comment>
