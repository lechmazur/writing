<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's methodically playful trait drives contradictory impulses—precision in tools versus improvisational flick of the nickel—culminating in earned surrender at "She’d come to be un-fixed," with embodied cost in layered sensations revealing her unmoored identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density spirals from failed direct touch to ricochet chime activating the mural, delivering Charged Poise closure when "frequencies had migrated... into her" with legible cost of lost certainty via stone replacement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden's brass petals and archways constrain choice via ricochet mechanics, charging final image as they "laughed with her" and rearrange; body as micro-setting (palm press, nickel warmth) mirrors sonic awakening without generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake to awaken mural deepens accumulatively from null vibration to spiraling chime forcing tactic shift, with agency in playful flick and cost felt in "weightless terror" layers narrowing to un-fixed poise at heartbeat echo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of ricochet awakening emerges organically via nested layers peeling to stories "swinging open inside her ribs," reweighting premise in final stone hum without moralizing, inviting ambiguity of "where it might lead."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with sonic perceptual signature ("ripples of ultrasonic blue") modulates rhythmically under pressure, stable single POV; purposeful synesthesia elided early and paid off in mural's bloom without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and sonic metaphors ("sound became shape") coherent across peak beats; zero loops, read-aloud rhythm breathes with intensification to closure image unscathed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sonic fresco restoration in resonance garden transforms awakening trope via hobo nickel ricochet, risking synesthetic world logic that heightens stakes organically to inevitable stone exchange.</comment>
