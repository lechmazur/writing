<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation rooted in childhood memory paid via scent trade reveals character under pressure; historian's weeping shows embodied recognition without therapy-speak. Micro-choices like barefoot walk and palm press align with stubborn intuition. Minor reflective summaries slightly abstract internal conflict from peak activation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from market acquisition to attic revelation to dimming closure (RR/Charged Poise), with lens energy spent as felt cost in "its task complete, its energy spent." One tightening via palm warmth/whisper activates triptych breathing. Orientation anchored early; no shards exceed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hemp planks sting soles and swaying bridges constrain barefoot navigation; crow-shawls and Clockwork Crane integrate into barter. Attic smog contrasts market hum, mirroring internal tides; final rooftops suspension charges closure image. Sensory bias (whispers, glows) reflects translator's perceptual priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unfasten grief via lens) signaled early, tightens at activation revealing figures, foreclosing erasure with historian's recognition cost. Accumulative density reweights overlooked histories; agency in seeking/using lens drives. Minor abstract stakes declaration pre-revelation slightly softens visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of whispered truths emerges via emerging figures and new commission, reweighting erasure as resilience without moralizing. Origami birds and crayon door recur to charge hope in final image. Subtext in Mara's warning pays off non-literally at dimming.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person perceptual signature ("truths shimmer elusively tangible") modulates with intensity; sparse dialogue (Mara's rasp) carries subtext and distinction. Stable distance, rhythmic syntax reflects suspended mind-state. Patterned elision taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: sentences layer sensory/propulsive work without loops; rhythm varies for sway/breath. Dense figuratives ("rope burns and salt of tears") purposeful in lyric mode, no muddle at peak reveal. Minor synonym echo ("between childhood and now") bookends without dragging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: origami memories as currency transforms relic trade; lens pulses drowned breaths into cultural revelation. Bold alchemist market overhead risks paid in coherent pressure; crayon door inflects hope inevitably from particulars.</comment>
