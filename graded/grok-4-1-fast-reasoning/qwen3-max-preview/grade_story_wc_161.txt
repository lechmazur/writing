<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pivotal shift from reinvention to open ledgers earned via meteorite resonance tying backstory fire/lullaby to on-page trill; contradictory scoff/hesitate impulses act in discovery beat with embodied weeping cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as meteorite inciting incident densities patterns to RR closure in pigeon's trill resurrecting melody; cost legible in "ink smearing her latest log" and transformed logs, with meteorite constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust motes/skylight constrain mapping choice driving pattern emergence and charge final image of applause-like settling; tactile attic details (calloused fingers, wing-straps) filter via POV cartographer bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Preservation stake signaled early tightens via agency-redesign embedding meteorite, forcing trust trade-off; cost unmistakable in exposed history foreclosing forgery, charging final letters.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final letter/image ("smelled like old books and tasted like starlight") offers resonant non-literal answer to erasure/inscription question, reweighting paper trails via prior dust/song particulars without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("dust motes swirled like forgotten alphabets") holds stable single POV with rhythmic modulation under stress at trill climax; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated metaphors ("cracked open Elara’s ribs like a music box") in peak trill beat; zero loops/artifacts, varied rhythm enhances accumulative cadence to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mars meteorite tuning pigeons/dust maps for song resurrection synthesizes fresh from attic particulars; risky lyric payoff feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
