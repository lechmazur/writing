<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Collector’s motivation to preserve methods roots in patient actions like sitting without invitation and mimicking knots, earning her change to “collecting hands.” Havel’s gnarled fingers and selective teaching reveal character through pressure. Internal conflict subtle in failed mimics before success; voice distinct in rasped dialogue vs. her murmurs. Minor slip: no deep contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from offering fulgurite to knot revelations, culminating in Charged Poise closure—“You’re not collecting seeds anymore”—with felt cost of hours in snow/fog. Orientation anchored early (dock, snowflakes, harbor). Single scene coherent, one tightening via Havel’s nod to teach. Lens taught implicitly through patient gestures.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog, snow, and rope constrain choices—thickening fog shawls them, cold tests patience—charging final fulgurite glint piercing fog. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: she notices rope tension over gulls. Details evolve causally (snow heavier, fog curls). Micro-setting (rope knots) mirrors internal preservation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve methods via weavers) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through knot-by-knot teaching, her fails narrowing to success. Agency in tracing/mimicking forecloses haste path with patience cost. One deepening: Havel’s hands-study shifts from skepticism to trust. Moral calculus in rejecting photos for carrying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of living preservation emerges via knots-as-stories, reweighted in “collecting hands” without statement. Final image (rope coiled, fulgurite by heart) offers resonant answer to oral tradition’s fragility. Subtext in silence/gestures; ambiguity in weavers’ future lingers meaningfully. No moralizing; complexity in modern forgetting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in storm/seed metaphors. Voice modulates rhythmically—short patient sentences amid descriptive swells. Dialogue subtextual (“sky’s broken tooth”) pursues goals, distinct idioms (rasped vs. murmured). Rhythmic control peaks in knot lessons without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: lines layer sensory/action (e.g., “fingers coax meaning from hemp and memory”). Rhythm varies, read-aloud flows; no loops or scaffolds. Figurative consistent in lyric mode, no muddle in peak (knot tying). Minor overwriting in metaphors like “pebbles rolling” slightly slows one beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: knots as encoded stories transforms preservation trope, grown from fulgurite offering to rope-carrying. Risk in lyric patience-build heightens stakes organically. Ingenuity in “storm’s eye” etc., inevitable hindsight via hands motif. No derivatives; bold knot-decoding frame.</comment>
