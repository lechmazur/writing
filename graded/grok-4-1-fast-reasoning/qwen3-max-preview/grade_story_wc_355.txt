<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation roots deeply in sacred archiving, embodied via war memory anchoring present tuning; micro-choices like frequency switches reveal values under pressure. Interiority particular (paints vibrations as hues/weights), but lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final realignment earns closure via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through layered frequencies to clasp's click (DC) and Charged Poise amid fireworks, with reverence as felt cost in "tears glistening not from triumph, but from reverence." Orientation anchors early (workshop, Elara, pre-fireworks). Single scene coherent, no shards needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Workshop micro-setting constrains via coils/vials chiming in response, charging final image as explosions shake walls but she stands unmoved. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (tremors cataloged, dust halos). Details evolve causally (moth wings syncopate), mirroring internal resonance without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover silences pre-noise) signals early, escalates via tightening frequency trials ("too blunt" to braided lullaby), narrowing to success under Accumulative lens. Agency in intuitive adjustments; cost legible in hairline fracture and reverence. One decisive deepening suffices, but external pressure (fireworks) complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (empathy via recovered silences) emerges organically from tuning acts and vial labels, culminating in CR: "path to empathy... carved by those who dared to kneel... unlock... silences" reweights premise without statement. Final image (unmoved amid detonations) resonates non-literally, inviting ambiguity on noise vs. stillness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (vibrations as "hues, weights, whispered geometries"); voice modulates rhythmically from descriptive buildup to compressed click. Prose texture distinct (lyric frequencies), no head-hopping or withholding. Experimental metaphor density taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels (each line advances resonance); rhythm varies (long builds to "click, soft as snowflake"). Minor overwriting in frequency metaphors ("braided silk, lullaby") risks coherence in peak but pattern-consistent, no loops/artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise transforms silence into tunable dialects archived via meteorite clasp, synthesizing pacifism/empathy ingeniously; risk in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes. Final fireworks contrast recharges workshop stillness inevitably. No derivative echoes, fully committed vision.</comment>
