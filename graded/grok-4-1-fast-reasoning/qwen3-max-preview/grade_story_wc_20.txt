<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (rigid balance vs. compassion) act in the ritual, earning the final mending; interiority concrete via "guilt calcified into a stone she carried beneath her ribs." Flaws complicate choices without hedging; solo POV heightens specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ritual actions and naming builds to Conceptual Repricing in coin shattering with felt cost ("weights lifted—not gone, but transformed"). Orientation anchors immediately; closure reconfigures stance legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Foundry constrains ritual (anvil, puddles); rain drums "like a thousand tapping fingers" mirrors naming stakes, charging final "golden seam glowed faintly on the anvil." Sensory hierarchy alchemical and embodied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (redemption via names) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as coin cracks from "saturation"; agency in persisting forecloses rigid balance with cost in shattering. One deepening suffices, cost legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (fracture/gold integration) emerges organically via ritual to resonant final image ("balance no longer a rigid scale, but a dance"); non-literal answer reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (alchemical bias: "kintsugi intentions"); rhythmic texture modulates intensity, purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off at shattering.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm; figurative density coherent and pattern-taught (gold seams as spirit kintsugi), no loops, but minor overwrites in peak metaphors slightly blur propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy/kintsugi/redemption via "factually mystical" coin feels inevitable; risk in solo ritual lyricism heightens emotional specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
