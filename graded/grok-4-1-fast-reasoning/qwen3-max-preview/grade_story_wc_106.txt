<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Thief's savvy motivation intensifies through selective interventions, embodied in heart-pounding tenderness; micro-choices like flower placements reveal values with depleting jar cost, though reflective backstory borders BRR limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as revelation density builds across vignettes to charged poise closure; legible cost in "jar nearly empty" reconfigures stance without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Station's moss-cracked tiles and platforms constrain tactical placements, mirroring internal patterns; clock tower sunset charges final image, with sensory selectivity urgent under depleting resource.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake of fate-translation escalates via jar depletion across two interventions, narrowing nudges; protagonist agency in codes forces trade-offs, cost legible in near-empty jar at poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Revelation-over-theft theme emerges organically from moonbeam visions and flower nudges, resonant in "soul brimming" finale that reweights particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct lyrical perceptual signature—favoring "illuminated moments"—modulates rhythmically; purposeful compression teaches poetic pattern paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High-density images like "moonbeams swirled like liquid mercury" propel without loops or muddle; figurative pattern taught early supports textural lens, clarity intact at ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh moonbeam-jar and flower-code synthesis transforms fate-nudging premise inevitably; bold lyric risk in accumulative vignettes heightens closure coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
