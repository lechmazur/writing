<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Holding cloth to ear dramatizes contradictory impulses (factual calibration vs. ghost vibration), earning final shift to project and listening with embodied throat-tightening cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from cloth scrutiny to ear-holding reversal, delivering Charged Poise closure in pinned note ("What’s broken still carries song") with emotional opening cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quarry acoustics ("hollows humming") and trailer artifacts (dusty drawers) constrain isolation and charge final pinning image, with sensory hierarchy (growling backhoe ignored) reflecting POV numbness-to-resonance arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (insulation vs. longing) deepens via agency in placing cloth with harmonica, narrowing to typing "Project Echo"; cost unmistakable in "pulse thudded—not with panic, but possibility," foreclosing emotional shutdown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final note "What’s broken still carries song" resonantly reweights relic-failure premise to tuning-fork possibility, emerging organically from cloth/harmonica without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quantitative perceptual signature ("thread count, weave pattern, oxidation") shifts to acoustic ghosts while holding rhythmic control; Ruiz dialogue distinct in idiom, advancing shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("He shut the laptop, tucked the speaker cloth into his breast pocket"); zero loops/artifacts, metaphors (wind scouring shale) cohere without muddling peak ear-holding beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quarry acoustics transforms roadie-failure epiphany into "echo valley longing" synthesis; risk of reflection-heavy lyricism pays off in charged closure without gimmickry.</comment>
