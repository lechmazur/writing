<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aris's receptivity to the uncanny drives consistent choices like planting the seed and designing rooms around its myth, with embodied patience in nightly soil touches revealing internal endurance; minor flaw in subtle rather than clashing impulses, but endurance earns closure cost in his satisfied death.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from seed planting to spiral growth; Conceptual Repricing closure lands decisively in journal line "The seed was never meant to flower," reweighting lifetime wait with conceptual cost of unrealized bloom, visible in buried journal beside brook.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Brook, willow, moss, and soil anchor sensory immersion early, constraining Aris's rituals (kneeling, fingertips in soil) and charging final journal image; nocturnal hush mirrors internal patience without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of safeguarding innovation tightens accumulatively via seed's sideways growth and room obsessions forcing client reactions; agency in weaving plant's hum into "The Spiral Root" forecloses rushed growth path with felt cost of obsession, though no sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of innovation from patient rot emerges organically via seed-room spiral motif shifting from dormancy to potential; final journal reconfigures premise non-literally, lingering ambiguity of bloom's irrelevance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature attuned to uncanny (phantom odors, ancient watch); lyrical rhythm modulates from hush to pulsing hum, distinct texture in nature-infused diction without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density weaves sensory propulsion with varied rhythm; purposeful metaphors like "question mark made flesh" avoid muddle, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image of cracked soil and journal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corpse flower seed as innovation gauntlet transforms escape-room tropes via orthogonal scent-sound puzzles; risk in grotesque patience pays off inevitably at journal reveal without gimmickry.</comment>
