<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in embodied confessions ("I was afraid," echoes dissolve), earning the merger with visible cost in reality's resistance; interiority particular without therapy-speak. Final integration renunciation forecloses fractured paths on page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of corridors/echoes breaks at tablet blooming/merger as RR with cost (viaduct cracks, echoes rush to merge); procedural shards taught early (~100 words), pattern legible to charged closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Viaduct's phosphorescent veins and frozen raindrops constrain steps/climax tremble, charging final merger image; sensory hierarchy (mist breath, bare feet hovering) mirrors untethered focus, selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-integration) signaled early, deepens via recursive echoes to agency-driven confessions narrowing fractured options; cost unmistakable in viaduct shudder and echo merger under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of branching self emerges organically from procedural corridors to final "I am the branching," reweighting premise in non-literal merger without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (runes as roots, timelines brushing) biases toward fractures; rhythmic control heightens pressure in climax confessions, POV stable/single.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure; figurative density (echoes as shadows, tablet petals) coherent/pattern-taught, no loops/muddle despite peak load.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of procedural self-labyrinth transforms timeline trope via rune logic and gravity defiance; risk in surreal recursion inevitable in hindsight, heightens stakes.</comment>
