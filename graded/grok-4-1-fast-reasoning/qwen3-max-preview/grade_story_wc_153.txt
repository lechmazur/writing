<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act concretely when she smudges "afraid" into "alive," earning the final spiritual healing with memory cost implied in prior healing lore; interiority embodied in sweat, trembling, and shard's warmth reveals particular flaws without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from whispers to leaf-messages to letter dissolution; Charged Poise closure lands on-page with cost in shard planted as "seed of stone" and letters absorbed, reconfiguring regret into resolve; orientation anchored immediately in mangroves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mangrove roots and branches constrain movement ("tightening like fingers," "trip her gently"), charging final path parting; moonlight and leaf-dew integrate tactilely into healing and messages, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to evoke pre-decision moment tightens texturally via songs keening, messages blooming ("You could have stayed"), forcing micro-choice to release letters; agency in placing them forecloses hesitation with cost of dissolution and memory theft felt in healing lore.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of cradling pain emerges implicitly from smudging words, glowing letters, and final "Go gently. You are loved," reweighting apology as present choice without moralizing; resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in spirit songs and moonlight's "fierce tenderness"; rhythmic prose modulates from humid tension to reverent quiet, heightening pressure without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with lines like "ink blurred by tears, each sealed with wax that cracked like frozen regret" advancing image and emotion; varied rhythm flows read-aloud, figurative language patterned for lyric payoff without muddle or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gargoyle shard in mangroves evokes unsent regrets via leaf-windows, transforming medium tropes through "evoke" hinge; risk in lyric closure heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
