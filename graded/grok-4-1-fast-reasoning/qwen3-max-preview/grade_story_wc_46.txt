<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete via polishing as embodied grief-work; contradictory impulses in memories vs. stillness act simultaneously; final surrender earned by vow's evolution into shared solace with child's reaction as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: memory density and polishing build to Charged Poise closure in basin's prismatic veins and child's "holding sky," reconfiguring purpose with surrender's felt cost; orientation anchored in opening line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto's mist and moss constrain kneeling/polishing, charge final image via filtered glow on glass; sensory hierarchy POV-specific (salt, cerium, condensation); micro-setting (basin, tools) guides sharing choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (share light sans fire) signaled in vow, tightens via polishing awakening glass for villagers; endurance agency forecloses conquest path, cost legible in resurfaced memories during child's lit face.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of polishing grief to reflection emerges via glass's evolution, not statement; final image (prismatic constellations, "window not weapon") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting trauma without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in tactile, luminous noticing (glass warming, mist breathing); rhythmic modulation under memory pressure; child's whisper natural, subtext-laden.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with polishing breaths; high density integrates action/atmosphere; minor figurative density ("mist curled like sleeping dragons") in opener purposeful but borders overwrite, no loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma alchemy via gem polishing transforms hermit/healing tropes; sea glass reprise as rebellion ("reflect, not ignite") inevitable from vow, risks lyric compression coherently.</comment>
