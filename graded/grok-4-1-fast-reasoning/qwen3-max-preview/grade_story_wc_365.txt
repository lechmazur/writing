<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira's sensory-specific interiority ("fingers tracing the oily floor as if reading braille") and motivation intensify credibly to the final weeping realization, earning a responsible stasis; minor flaw in lightly told "trial and cyclically spontaneous failure" backstory slightly flattens early contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as shard pulses and sensory density build to Conceptual Repricing closure ("some truths don’t set you free—they make you responsible") with undeniable conceptual cost in the dimmed shard and return; two-shard structure with viscous transition legible, orientation anchored instantly, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Abandoned bay's "oily floor," "dust motes," and "broken gantries" constrain choices (silence as "cathedral") and charge final image of crumbling return; sensory hierarchy (scent, vibration, hum) reflects Elira's perceptual bias without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unveil withheld truth) signaled early tightens via shard's flare at core touch, forcing endurance of erasure ("in this world, she had never existed"); agency in sidestepping narrows options under Accumulative lens, cost legible in "unbearable lightness," but no sharp moral calculus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truths' responsibility emerges organically from shard-core resonance and final "woven into her bones," reweighting premise without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in weeping contrasts initial discovery drive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("liminal seams... sensed through scent, vibration") biases noticing with lyrical rhythm modulating to viscous transition; stable close-third POV, purposeful compression taught early pays off at closure without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm and concrete images ("film peeling from reality’s surface"), but figurative density in opening beats ("ghosts of engines," "braille") borders overwriting without full pattern payoff; no loops, clean syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory multiverse navigation via shard transforms parallel-world trope through grounded perceptual rules and responsibility repricing; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at core touch.</comment>
