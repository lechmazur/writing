<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization excels in tutor’s consistent curiosity rooted in nimble hands and building-language obsession, compelling the seal exchange; neighbor’s riddles apply crucible pressure, forcing truth from lies. Contradictory impulses—whimsical facade vs. reciprocal drive—act in scene via patient visits. Final choice to pocket key earned by prior causality with relational cost of exposed motives.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of clues builds to Charged Poise closure in seal/key exchange and building's sigh, reweighting lies-to-truth stake with conceptual cost of reciprocal engagement. Orientation anchored early in rooftop/meteors; backstory shards under BRR tilt present without flattening. No causality breaks; persistent constraint of unspoken agreement shapes tactics to revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting vividly selective via POV—moss-tracing fingers, meteor scars, rooftop sighs—mirrors internal syntax quest; rooftop garden constrains exchange by isolating under shower's glow. Recurring building whispers evolve causally, charging final descent image. Micro-object (seal) as setting constrains cipher choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of building-language deciphering signaled early, tightens accumulatively via riddle-tea pattern to key reveal narrowing whimsical facade. Agency in bringing seal forces confession; cost legible in ended lies and thigh-cold key commitment. Minor abstractness in "stories to tell" slightly mutes visceral price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of patient syntax in sighs emerges organically from sugar-lies scaffold crumbling to truth; subtext in "no lies exchanged" reweights companionship premise without moralizing. Final image of building's recognition offers resonant answer to isolation-through-listening question. Particulars like clay tablets avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in architectural whispers and nimble tactility; dialogue subtextual and idiomatic ("Third-floor joists sing"), advancing via riddles. Rhythmic modulation peaks in terse "You knew...I suspected," heightening pressure; no head-hopping, elisions taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "patina catching starlight like a promise" advances atmosphere/foreshadow); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in opening ("silver scars") risks slight overwrite but pattern-taught and purposeful for textural lens; closure propulsion clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tutor-deciphering sentient mortar via inherited seal transforms whimsy into urgent reciprocity; risk in sentient-building premise pays off in key/sigh reconfiguration. No derivative echoes; bold lies-to-truth arc feels inevitable from particulars.</comment>
