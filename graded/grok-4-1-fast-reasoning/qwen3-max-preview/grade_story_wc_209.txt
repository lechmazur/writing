<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation rooted in childhood gnaw, shown via journey and tears; micro-choices like packing satchel and kneeling reveal values. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously limits to very strong; serenity dominates without raw hypocrisy. Final surrender earned by prior persistence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motif density builds from postcards to glass flowers to mural reprise, culminating in CR where understanding reweights obscurity with heavier-heart cost. Mosaic shards (pavilion-journey-cathedral-return) taught early via postcards; legible transitions. Cost legible in "satchel lighter, her heart heavier."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Etched glass constrains discovery via fading light and lens, charging final mural image. Sensory bias (turpentine-lavender to incense-stone) vivid, selective, POV-filtered; cathedral evolves causally with dusk. No white-room; spatial coherence in nave-sill-altar.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (flower mystery) signaled early, escalates via textural deepening: postcard anomaly to layered blooms aligned with lunar cycles. Agency in reckoning forecloses ignorance with tearful realization cost. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of nocturnal beauty emerges organically from hidden cereus/moonflowers to garden hymn; final image reweights premise non-literally—"flowers bloom... everything makes sense." No moralizing; ambiguity in "surrender" lingers with conceptual cost of persistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature (tracing edges, shadows to velvet); rhythm modulates from hush to thunder to tenderness. Single POV stable, no leakage; diction reflects artist's eye (petals as prayer). Patterned compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors consistent (roots like veins, petals mid-prayer) without muddle in discovery beat. Minor figurative density risks overwrite but pays off in charged images. No loops; rhythm varies, openings diverse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art quest with night-bloom encoding in glass; transforms artist trope via lunar math specificity. Risky mosaic/lyric heightens resonance without gimmick; inevitable hindsight from postcard anomaly to mural continuance.</comment>
