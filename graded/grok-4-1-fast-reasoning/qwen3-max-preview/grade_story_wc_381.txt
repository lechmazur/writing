<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong particular interiority in breath-heart syncing and flowing into whisper; micro-choices like cradling the plea earn her guardian stance. Minimal internal contradiction limits 9+; serene competence shows little struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wing placement to resonant whisper ("The sky forgets only when the earth stops listening") to final spiral, delivering RR/Charged Poise with cost in her nightly resolve. Orientation anchored early; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brook's "murmur flowed not as sound but as texture" and dew-damp knees integrate sensory hush to constrain her barefoot ritual and charge final image; POV bias sharpens to moss/root immediacies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush prophecy) deepens via whisper's fracture into plea, narrowing to her cradle/answer with ongoing commitment cost; agency in mapping flows under textural lens, but subtle micro-turn lacks sharper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-speech emerges via prophecy's softening and wing's ascent ("woven with lullaby-light"), reweighting doom to guardianship without statement; final "silence that makes space for stars to speak" resonates non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("water’s murmur flowed... as texture") stable in single POV; rhythmic modulation from hush to radiant spiral heightens pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm, but overwriting in "velvet void where meaning pooled" risks figurative muddle in sustained poetic beats; no loops, clear propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms summoning trope into flow/silence mapping, with origami wing's glow-to-spiral risking bold lyricism that heightens stakes organically.</comment>
