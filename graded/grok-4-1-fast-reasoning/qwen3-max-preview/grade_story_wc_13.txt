<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied panic ("hands trembled") yielding micro-choice to sculpt time around the chime; motivation intensifies via prior dissonance, compelling chamber entry and earned closure in sketchbook snap. Contradictory impulses (panic vs. sculpting) act simultaneously mid-climax. Final renunciation of pendant seals change with felt fatigue cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from canal navigation to chamber womb, chime as pattern break tightens to release; on-page Charged Poise closure in "work here was done" with conceptual cost of borrowed time snapping back averted via anchors. Orientation anchored by para 1; no lens ambiguity. Persistent pendant constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rooftop canals constrain via slick stone climbs and resonance amplification, charging final echo release; sensory hierarchy (echoes as mercury pools, dew-slick glyphs) reflects illustrator's acoustic bias. Final city wake mirrors internal success through birdsong hum. Body/pendant as micro-setting enables borrowing with searing cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert echo collapse pre-wake) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven chime bend narrowing options; cost legible in "pendant grew hot, then searing" altering tactics to dream-murmur siphon. Escalation accumulates texturally to womb release, forcing endurance with curiosity-stir cost felt in eyelid twitch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of malleable time preserving lost via echoes emerges organically from uncaging acts; final image of rediscovered voices non-literally answers erosion question, reweighting illustrations as anchors without moral state. Subtext in pendant fade carries ambiguity of borrowed sustainability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in acoustic-time synesthesia (e.g., "whispers... trapped half-formed songs"); rhythmic compression heightens under chime stress without slippage. Distinct diction biases toward resonance particulars, modulating to quiet poise at close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "peeling instants like petals from frozen blossoms" advances action/motif); varied rhythm propels from climb to release, zero loops/artifacts, coherent metaphors (echoes as embryos). Closure image clear, propulsive without overwriting in peak chamber beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal acoustics in resonance canals transforms extinction trope via illustrator's midwifery; risk in giant's dream-borrow payoff heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early cadence rupture. No derivative echoes, bold premise integrity to voice.</comment>
