<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elira's micro-choices in dance reveal hierarchy of values, earning final sacrifice with visible cost; abstract phrasing like "encrypt vulnerability as strength" borders on label-speak, softening embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds via patterned dance beats building to CR closure—"vanished... rewritten"—with conceptual cost of self-erasure legible in final image; orientation anchored early in lab/sea trench.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken lab's flooded corridors and vents constrain dance choreography, charging final surge as veil; selective sensory details (phosphorescent algae, sonar echoes) filter through Elira's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of liberation deepens accumulatively from drone evasion to final encryption, driven by agency in dance that forecloses personal escape; cost unmistakable in not boarding submersible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of resonance over force emerges organically via dance/journal images, final capsule notation offering non-literal answer—"Let them follow the rhythm"—reweighting prior web/dice motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close yields distinct perceptual signature in rhythmic, biased noticing (e.g., "body translating pressure gradients"); purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image integration, but minor paraphrase loops in dance descriptions (e.g., repeated "pirouetted... carving arcs") slightly dull mid-beat propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dance-as-protocol synthesis transforms cyberpunk lab tropes via web patience and glyph dice, with final rewrite turn inevitable from established pattern; bold lyric risk heightens stakes.</comment>
