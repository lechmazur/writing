<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exemplary single-POV interiority with embodied emotion ("rattled her molars") and micro-choices under pressure (patching at 2:17 a.m.); cautious hope constrains decisive action without tidy epiphany; earned endurance in final whisper forecloses complacency with ongoing vigilance cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from decoding to interference to signal retreat; on-page Charged Poise closure ("signal writhed, weakened, then retreated") with conceptual cost of inevitable return; orientation anchored in first paragraph, no waivers needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory vividness (subsonic "vibrated beneath human hearing") and micro-setting (jury-rigged box "humming beneath the desk") constrain choices; final chart-pinning charges closure image; POV-filtered astronomer priorities shape notice of waveforms and pulsar.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (outwit signal to calm campus) signaled early, tightens via agency-driven test pulse yielding forum reports and signal "irritation"; cost legible in campus "breathing" but not healed, her sustained watch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of hope as counter-frequency emerges organically from particulars (violin tuned to lullabies); final whisper ("Try me again") offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting tricksters' corrosion with her grit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with perceptual signature (pattern recognition in waveforms); rhythmic control modulates from setup to peak ("hands didn’t shake") without elision or head-hopping; voice texture distinct and pressure-responsive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("peeling skin from an apple") integrated into action; varied rhythm propels without loops or scaffolds; closure line clean and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of subsonic psych-warfare and frequency lullabies transforms alien invasion trope; risk in quiet closure (whisper challenge) heightens stakes organically; inevitable in hindsight from early charts and grit.</comment>
