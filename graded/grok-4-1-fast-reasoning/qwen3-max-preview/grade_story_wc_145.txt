<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority and motivation through concrete micro-choices like muttering to the falcon and tracing glyphs, with contradictory impulses (no cheer, just tea) earning the final witnessing shift; subtly confident trait shown in smirk amid isolation without panic. Flaws like stubborn isolation compound quietly. Meets 9+ test with embodied confidence constraining loud glory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build from map scrap to condensation delta to ice sigh, delivering CR closure in spiral drawing with legible conceptual cost ("stops editing—and starts witnessing"); orientation anchored early at outpost/lake/falcon return. One tightening at delta pattern suffices; constraint of method shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen lake and grimed window constrain choices (glass as divining rod, lake edge for whisper), charging final image; sensory details like ice groaning and condensation fractals selective via cartographic POV bias. Micro-setting (phrasebook, glass) mirrors internal convergence without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (river origins) signaled early tightens texturally at condensation delta narrowing to ice seam response; agency in whispers forecloses flag-planting with felt cost in nuanced witnessing over noise. Escalation driven by pattern alignment under Textural lens; cost unmistakable in spiral act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of myth/meltwater origins emerges organically from glyph-condensation and spiral image reweighting maps/language; resonant non-literal answer in "rivers begin where language listens" without moralizing. Complexity lingers in quiet heralds; final image recharges particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in cartographic diction ("tributary glyphs," "watershed divides") and rhythmic modulation (short decisive sentences at ice sigh); POV stable first-person with confidence matching knowledge. Voice reflects dry wit in "feathered bureaucrat"; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "ice groaned like an old ship" advances atmosphere/action); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops/artifacts, purposeful metaphors coherent (delta branching matches rivers). Propulsion peaks at spiral without overwriting in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistics/thermodynamics/cartography transforms quest trope into lyric convergence; risk in condensation method and spiral CR heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable particulars like phrasebook equations feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
