<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's careful resourcefulness drives micro-choices like scavenging tweezers and splicing tapes, earning her final upload and escape without shakes under pressure. Contradictory resolve shines in "hands never shook," balancing competence with regime stakes. No other characters on-page keeps focus pure; motivation intensifies via sirens to compel broadcast.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: puddle chases → lagoon alignment → hatch key → rewiring → blackout broadcast → escape. Orientation anchors in first paragraph (Elira, lagoon, key). Closure as Decisive Change lands on-page: "dials flare to life," with cost in sirens/enforcers; final card reconfigures pursuit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Auric lagoon constrains via ripples/map and escape glow, charging final "vanished into the lagoon’s glow." Sensory selection (cool water, dust/static) filters through Elira's rebel lens. Details like "submerged slab" evolve with action, mirroring remembrance theme without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore histories) signaled early, escalates causally via rewiring under sirens, narrowing to endurance choice. Agency in "bypassed the kill-switches" forecloses capture path with felt cost (blackout/power siphon). One tightening suffices; moral calculus in indifference vs. truth visible at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance cracking indifference emerges via puddle maps to broadcast lullabies, reweighting regime lies without statement. Final image ("Ace of Keys") offers non-literal answer: freedom reappears quietly. Subtext in "not with explosions, but with remembrance" charges closure organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias (puddles as portals); voice texture modulates from strategic crouch to "small and sharp" smile under stress. Rhythmic prose ("water cool as forgotten truth") reflects Elira's resourceful mind. No dialogue; elision of backstory anchors to present key slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density: lines like "wires like veins drained of life" advance atmosphere/action without loops. Rhythm varies (short punchy sentences at sirens); no artifacts, metaphors cohere (auric fire dials). Propulsion peaks at "She didn’t run," breathing with closure poise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Puddle-reflection maps and analog Archive Engine synthesize fresh rebel ingenuity, transforming trope via tactile rewiring. Ace of Keys escape risks bold symbol without gimmick, inevitable from resourceful trait. Premise commits to coded resistance, heightening stakes uniquely.</comment>
