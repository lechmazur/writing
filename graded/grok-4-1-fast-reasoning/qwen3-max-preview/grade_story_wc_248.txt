<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in survival traits drives higher-stakes artistic trail, embodied in weeping at tapestry recognition; interiority concrete via patterns in smoke/charred spines, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in peak chamber scene, softening 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of discoveries (tapestry to tremors) tightens to RR closure at palm-press shudder/voices, with conceptual cost legible in final "throat of the earth" fissure; orientation anchored by ~50 words, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via "collapsed antechamber" slab unearth and "obsidian seal," charging final light-dissolving walls; sensory hierarchy (petrified ink/salt) filters through analytical intuition, evolving with tremors to mirror internal resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue promise) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via trail-creations forcing tremors/doors under her agency; cost felt in world's "criminal" label vs. archivist role at close, but one tightening sufficient without micro-turn excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preservation-through-destruction emerges organically from arsonist past to singing archive, resonant non-literal answer in "mercy flowed...as continuation"; final image reweights fire/memory without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature ("volcanic tenderness") modulating rhythm under rising density; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm/syntax propels via image integration (e.g., "threads brittle as dried veins"); minor figurative density in creations beat borders overwrite (-0.3), but purposeful motif avoids muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist-savior via ancestor/future self-portrait transforms trope; risk-taking in accumulative art-trail to CR closure feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmick.</comment>
