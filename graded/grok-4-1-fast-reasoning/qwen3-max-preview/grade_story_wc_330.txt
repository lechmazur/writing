<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silent carpenter's motivation roots in interpreting silence, shown through persistent micro-choices like placing the halo fragment and "singing" wordlessly, earning the closure endurance of never speaking while achieving carousel life; contradictory impulses peak when silence becomes "chorus," with embodied cost in bone-hum.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup from dream chime to wind bells harmonizing, culminating in Charged Poise RR where carousel turns under halo light, reconfiguring silence with undeniable conceptual cost ("beauty left incomplete is a wound"); orientation anchored by ~100 words, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (sawdust/caramel ghosts, groaning wood, moss-swallowed wheels) filters through carpenter's tactile bias, constraining choices (climbing aboard, fingers trailing calliopes) and charging final image (wood against wood whispering); recurring wind bells evolve causally to chime perfect note.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interpret/complete carousel) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via stirring horses to full gallop, driven by agency in wordless song/work; one tightening forecloses incomplete beauty path with felt persistence cost, legible in "hush... holding its breath."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-possibility/sanctuary emerges organically from particulars like halo pulse and horse eyes' recognition, resonant non-literal answer in final circle/smile reweighting wrong turn as "compass needle"; no moralizing, ambiguity in "never need to" lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (silence as "native tongue," sensory hush), rhythmic control modulates from mist hush to humming bones; purposeful compression taught early pays off in closure image without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm/syntax propels (e.g., "creak of wood, sigh of metal"), no loops/artifacts; minor figurative density in peaks ("mist curling like cats," "syrup") purposeful for textural lens but risks slight overwrites without obscuring closure gleam.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of abandoned circus reliquary and silent song transforms whimsy tropes via grounded persistence, risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes; final "shimmering note" feels inevitable, no derivative echoes.</comment>
