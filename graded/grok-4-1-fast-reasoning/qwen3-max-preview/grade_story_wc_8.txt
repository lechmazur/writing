<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in calibrated traits drives micro-choices like tracing the letter and planning parallels; emotionally rational attribute embodies contradiction without therapy-speak. Internal conflict subtle but present in weighing publication risks versus evidence. Minor flaw: resolution lacks deeper simultaneous impulses acting in peak reflective beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from discovery to resolve; CR closure in final stride and station's exhale reweights myth with conceptual cost to society. Orientation anchored early in station gloom. No causality breaks; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (ivy strangling beams, brass edge, vellum smell) filter through historian's priorities and constrain discovery. Setting mirrors internal states via cracking roots and exhaling station, charging final image. Recurrent rose petal reprise reconfigures pretense.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue truth) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via letter's proof and mentor's warning, narrowing to careful publication with felt societal resistance cost. Agency in resolve forecloses raw accusation path. Escalation coherent under lens but lacks one sharper option-narrowing turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Noble lies theme emerges organically from letter's exposure and family parallels, culminating in resonant CR invitation without moralizing. Subtext in petal's "crimson surrender" reweights memory's mortar. Complexity lingers in revisionist skepticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: historical metaphors (roots as veins, lantern in hurricane) biased toward curated silences. Rhythmic control modulates from damp gloom to resolve; no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels from moss-brushing to petal drop; figurative language purposeful without muddle in peak beats. Minor synonym churn on "lie" variants but thematic, not looping. Read-aloud rhythm charges closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of historical revisionism through personal/family parallels transforms trope; petal and station exhale feel inevitable. Bold reflective risk heightens stakes without gimmickry. Minor proximity to standard myth-busting arcs.</comment>
