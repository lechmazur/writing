<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Traveler's motivation to map healing via obituaries rooted in embodied memory (thread pulsing) and micro-choices (projecting presence in writing); internal conflict in grief's "hollows" acts simultaneously with precise action. Final renunciation—"They did not pray. They did not hope. They mapped."—earned by prior causality with solitude's cost. Contradictory impulses in writing the living as present satisfy 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from setup (thread, garden) to deepening (Elira's obituary as compass) to CR closure in crane-tucking and final mapping stance. Orientation anchored early ("damp stone...shadowed garden in autumn"). Cost legible in "solitude that didn’t ache so much as shimmer"; lens unambiguous, persistent thread constraint shapes final image for 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Selective sensory vividness (leaves "whispered...crunch," ink "bleeding like old wounds") filtered via POV sorrow; garden micro-setting constrains (hides crane under rosebush). Recurring thread charges closure ("catching the last sliver of moonlight"), satisfying 9+ gate. Atmosphere tensions lonesome splendor without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping healing geographies) signaled early, textural escalation via Elira details and thread resonance narrows to Charged Poise closure. Protagonist agency in writing/folding forecloses hope/prayer path with felt solitude cost. One decisive deepening sufficient under lens; 9+ agency and unmistakable cost on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of presence-in-absence emerges organically from particulars (obituaries as cartography); final image ("every step stitches sky to sea," mapping glorifies gone) offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise, satisfying 9+. No moralizing; ambiguity in "resonance" lingers meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (sorrow as "topography"); lyrical syntax/rhythm ("beauty carved from decay") modulates intensity purposefully. No head-hopping or leakage; diction biased to traveler's cartographic lens. 9+ rhythmic control under reflective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (short punchy finals vs. flowing descriptives); purposeful lyric metaphors cohere without muddle. Minor scaffold in repeated "not magic, but memory" (twice, pattern-taught) and garden paraphrase echoes deduct slightly, but no closure touch or loops dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: obituaries as "intimate cartography" with thread talisman transforms grief trope; crane-tucking under rosebush turn inevitable from prior mapping. Bold lyric risk heightens stakes coherently (+0.3); no derivative echoes, satisfying 9+.</comment>
