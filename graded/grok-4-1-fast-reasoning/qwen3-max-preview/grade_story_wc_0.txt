<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivation rooted in stripping drama via gradual decay is vividly embodied in micro-choices like forgoing gloves and sleeping by the slide; interior shift to humility earned through spiral discovery forecloses astrophysics path with career cost. Contradictory impulses subtle but present in colleagues' "breakdown" vs. her recalibration. Final renunciation of neutron stars feels inevitable from prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations build density from sifting dust to logarithmic spiral, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure where dust reconfigures cosmic premise with humility cost ("wept then"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via dawn spiral pays off pattern. No lens ambiguity or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting (shattered glass, humidifier hexagons, drafty spirals) constrains dust patterns and charges final slide-as-aurora image; sensory hierarchy via scientist's bias (dew eddies, air currents). Details evolve causally, mirroring internal calibration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recalibrate decay perception) escalates texturally via intensifying observations to spiral climax, narrowing from ruin-grief to cosmic symmetry with agency in sustained attention; cost legible in wept humility and career pivot. One decisive deepening suffices; pressure coheres without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of decay-as-refinement emerges organically from dust geometries and neutron parallels, reweighted in final image without moralizing; resonant CR answers "abandon stars?" via "found them here," embracing complexity over cataclysms. Subtext in dust-as-lens invites lingering ambiguity on perception's filter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (fractal scales, quantum lattice) biases noticing toward cosmic patterns; voice texture poetic-scientific modulates from purposeful sifting to awed weeping. No head-hopping; rhythmic control heightens textural accumulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm (short declarative amid lyric drifts); no loops, scaffolds, or filter stacks dull propulsion—peak spiral beat clean of artifacts. Minor figurative density fits voice but risks slight overwrite in "poetry... more awe"; syntax varies for ear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neutron astrophysics and butterfly fractals transforms tropes of loss/recovery into micro-cosmic ingenuity; risk in dust-self-organization pays off at spiral, heightening stakes without gimmick. Irreplaceable premise integrity from Madagascar vial to hung aurora.</comment>
