<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under reflective pressure reveal a hierarchy of values honoring unseen labor; motivation intensifies through aligned actions like whistling the widow's name. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9+; serenity dominates without deep scene conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from droplets/sighs to firefly alignment and final whisper, landing Charged Poise/CR closure; cost legible in "fading footprints" and world's fraying. Orientation anchored early; one deepening via fireflies suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (slick stone, moon sheen, damp rock) filter through POV bias toward patterns/effort; parapet/whisk constrain choices and charge final image of blinking fireflies tracing paths.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appreciating hidden effort) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via widow anecdote/fireflies into stance crystallization; cost felt in eternal unseen labor reweighting her place. Agency in endurance/attention forecloses isolation path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden effort emerges organically from particulars (nets, chalk tallies, fireflies); final "I see you" and descent offer resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature (patterns in knots/currents/fireflies); rhythmic prose modulates reflective intensity, diction controlled and voice-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; minor overwriting in figurative density ("scintillatingly somber" repeat, stacked images mid-story) slips but doesn't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of net-mender philosopher weaving wonder like nets; moon paths/firefly shanty transform lyric tropes boldly, with risk heightening quiet stakes.</comment>
