<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to leaf's float and dissolution as RR/Charged Poise closure; conceptual cost legible in her synced pulse becoming relay, reconfiguring solitary purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lichen pulsing with emotions constrains perception and charges climax; cave's tidal rhythm syncs her breath in final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Thermographic diction and perceptual bias ("thermal ghosts," "degrees Celsius") sustain sensory-mapper signature under climax pressure.</comment>
