<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (city deems mad, she persists with certainty) act in testing and packing beats; final satchel-packing choice earned by breakthrough causality with visible cost of potential erasure. Interiority particular and embodied ("hollow ache beneath her ribs"). Flaws (obsessive isolation) complicate but propel resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of whistle refinements builds to Charged Poise closure in "Either way, the sunwashed dread would finally have a voice," reconfiguring options with legible cost of mythic loss. Watcher head-turn ("slow pivot like tectonic stone") tightens stakes decisively. Orientation anchored early in map-tracing para.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Turtle-shell ridges constrain midnight climb choice and charge final image; cartographer's perceptual bias turns grooves into streets, sun-bleached sky embodies dread. Sensory hierarchy narrows to whistle tremble under dawn urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel watchers' silence) signaled early, deepens via watcher pivot narrowing to immediate action; agency in packing forecloses hesitation with felt cost of expedition fate. Accumulative pressure coheres to charged final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silence-as-theme emerges organically from whistle patterns and spirals, resonant in final "watchers... would have to choose whether to remain silent—or confess," reweighting indifference without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (everything as spirals/grooves) biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from reflective to resolute in packing beat. Stable single POV, no elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, varied rhythm; minor figurative density ("smoke," "failed lungs," "electric certainty") in dawn test para overwrites subtle pressure slightly but stays voice-consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of turtle-shell cartography, breath-code whistles, and horizon watchers feels inevitable; bold premise risks mythic quiet ending that heightens conceptual stakes.</comment>
