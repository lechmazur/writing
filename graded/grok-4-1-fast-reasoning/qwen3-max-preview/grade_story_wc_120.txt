<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in pushing exhaustion despite rule, embodied in aching bones and warming shell; final endurance earned by recursive mapping ritual, revealing hierarchy of values in "remembering how to try."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ritual whisper to swelling scenes and horizon split as Charged Poise RR; cost legible in "body forgets how to hold time" and self-snuffed candle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass spire constrains via resonance ripples and absorption, charging final vibration/split; micro-setting of nautilus and frost integrates tactilely, mirroring memory spiral without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake to conduct symphonies tightens via one decisive deepening—last memory's weave to crescendo—forces trade-off with exhaustion; cost felt in pushed rule and harmonic fissures, though agency dominates without reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory as score emerges organically from particulars like shell chambers as streets; final "world where symphonies need no audience" reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost of reverent silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with biased noticing (e.g., "fractal lace," "trapped breath"); rhythmic texture modulates from hush to vibration, perceptual signature cryptic-haunted.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm propels via varied syntax mirroring hush-to-crescendo; figurative density high but pattern-taught in lyric mode, though minor overload in blooming images dulls peak propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-writer conducting memory symphonies in resonant spire transforms tropes; risk of surreal horizon split inevitable from shell/ritual buildup, heightening stakes organically.</comment>
