<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elira's pacifism roots motivation in nonviolent persistence, with embodied contradictions peaking in shadow integration: "You carried me like a wound... Now carry me like a wing," earning the buoyant step forward with felt release cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through ritual stitching to Charged Poise closure in the gate's yawn and embrace; emotional gravity constraint shapes tactics, with Tear's dissolution as legible conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recycled spaceship's rust, failing gravity, and sentient responses (dimming lights) constrain emotional calibration and charge the climax groan; viewport ritual anchors POV bias in "cracked" relics mirroring internal seams.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of precise emotional resonance escalates via final photo and shadow confrontation, forcing integration trade-off; agency in stitching narrows options under lens, with ship buckling as visible price charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of healing wounds through darkness integration emerges via particulars like crystallized tears shifting to "overwhelmed joy," resonating in non-literal reunion without moralizing; final meadow embrace reweights pacifism's persistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person perceptual signature filters through light/grief biases ("hair floating like kelp"); rhythmic modulation peaks in song-tremble under stress, with shadow whisper carrying subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful metaphors ("needle-fine intent," "grams of levity per heartbeat"); minor figurative density in setup beats doesn't obscure, but elevated diction borders register drift in exposition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Bold synthesis of emotional gravity physics and tear-stitched dimensions transforms isolation tropes; shadow-as-wing reconfiguration feels inevitable from ritual particulars, with risk-taking in lyric closure heightening stakes.</comment>
