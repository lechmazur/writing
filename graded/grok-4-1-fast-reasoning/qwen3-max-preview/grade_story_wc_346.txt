<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Puppet memory in flooded toyshop concretely anchors motivation and internal conflict between saving and honoring; micro-choices like tracing Möbius band reveal hierarchy of values with embodied cost in scarred fingers. Contradictory awe at tenderness fulfills 9+ test without unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as nested patterns densify hush from "pane" to "viscous, golden" membrane, culminating in Charged Poise RR at puppet eye's chime unraveling causality with conceptual cost of gentle decay over salvation; oriented by ~50 words, no Orientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse's salt-worn stone and brass chronometer constrain ascent and placement, charging final image as glass dissolves into mist; recurring puppet head as micro-setting enables resonance. Sensory hierarchy (groaning stairs, prismatic shards) biases via adjuster's temporal friction, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (gentle end) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern activation narrowing to stillness (sea stilled, stars folding); agency in whispering forecloses violent end with felt cost in "not saved... honored it," legible in final exhale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of mercy in flaws emerges organically from puppet's smile despite shatter to universe's drowsy surrender; final image of eyeless puppet as "witness... relic of tenderness" offers resonant CR reweighting end-times premise without moralizing, fulfilling 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature in biased noticing ("hush thicker than marrow," "fractal lullabies"); rhythmic modulation peaks in short, charged closure lines. No elision or head-hopping; voice texture as character under awe.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "His fingers, scarred by temporal friction, traced..."); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, coherent metaphors (Möbius lullabies) taught early without muddle in peak chime beat. Zero loops, scaffold, or artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms doomsday trope into fractal lullaby for merciful entropy via puppet resonance; bold lyric risk in stillness cascade heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from vocation setup.</comment>
