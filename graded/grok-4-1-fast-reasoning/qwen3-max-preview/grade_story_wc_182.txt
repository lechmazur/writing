<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elira's traits shine through concrete actions like sensing linguistic strata and using silence as a tool, compelling her renegotiation choice; Kael applies relational pressure but shifts quickly without deep contradiction. Internal conflict is subtle, with competence dominating over simultaneous impulses. Final hand-offering reveals values hierarchy with cost to savior role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of gaps and linguistic imagery builds to CR closure in lexicon's shifting sentence, reweighting rescue with conceptual cost of reconciliation over extraction. Orientation anchored early via chronal signature and mountain bookstore. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in harmonized core and shelves' rearrangement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains via stuttering gravity, toppled shelves, and hollow absence shaping path to lexicon; sensory linguistic strata (ozone, glyphs whispering) filters through Elira's bias. Mountain's exhale and realigning shelves charge final image, mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve fractured lexicon/chrono-core) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via "in the gaps" realization narrowing extraction option; agency in diary placement forecloses prior tactics with relational cost to Kael's mission. One tightening suffices, pressure coheres to Charged Poise at revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge-as-choosing emerges organically from gaps-as-doors and lexicon's message, reweighting premise in final image without moralizing; subtext in "unheard symphony" lingers via semantic blossoms. Protagonist arc inextricable from reconciliation insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with Elira's perceptual signature (syntax bending causality); voice rhythmic and linguistic, modulating from echoing boots to quiet crescendo. Dialogue subtextual and goal-driven, e.g., "Neither are you" tensions status.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (verb roots splitting) advancing texture; varied rhythm supports propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in opening risks slight overwrite, but pattern-taught and closure-clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic fantasy transforms rescue trope via sentient lexicon and gaps-as-agency; risk in poetic compression heightens conceptual stakes, inevitable in hindsight via diary's payoff.</comment>
