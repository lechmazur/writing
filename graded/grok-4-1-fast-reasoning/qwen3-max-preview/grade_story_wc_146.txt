<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent in patient steps inheriting lost guilds, actions align revealing value hierarchy; interiority embodied in vibration "up her arm like a root seeking water," but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, limiting 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from ripples to full harmony; closure as Charged Poise lands on-page with fork laid in basin and "her footfalls now silent, her rhythm absorbed" as felt cost, reconfiguring continuity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobblestones constrain precise steps and charge final hum "within themselves"; sensory hierarchy (whispering boots, felt vibration) reflects tuner's priorities, vivid economy integrates with action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revival via rhythm) signaled early, escalates accumulatively from shutter creaks to clock ticking true; one deepening at fountain narrows to counterpoint with endurance cost in absorbed rhythm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of balance between lost/echoing emerges organically via steps tuning memories; final "Virelle breathed... rebalanced" offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (rhythmic resonance in "metronomic precision," "vibrating in harmony"); stable single POV, purposeful compression taught early pays off at shimmering archway.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "left foot first, heel striking the third cobblestone"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, figuratives like "dust motes in slanting sun" purposeful without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tuning fork/memory + footsteps transforms ghost town trope; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes, inevitable in "new bell tuner... feeling the rhythm in their ribs."</comment>
