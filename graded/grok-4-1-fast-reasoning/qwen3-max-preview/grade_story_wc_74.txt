<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Characterization excels in painter's consistent motivation rooted in proving kindness via glyphs, embodied in ritual choices; methodically hopeful trait constrains frantic despair effectively. Minor weakness: internal conflict leans lyrical over contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but final invitation to girl earns change with felt solitude cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of glyph effects building resonance; orientation anchors painter, rooftop, nights by first paragraph. Closure as Charged Poise in shared painting reconfigures solitary ritual with undeniable relational cost, legible in girl's glyph sketch moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse and smog-choked city constrain ritual (align canvas with moon path, fire escape offerings); sensory details like soot-streaked glass and salt-jasmine air selective via POV urgency. Final image charges with moon-glow greenhouse as micro-setting enabling communal turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove strangers remember kindness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via barista act, note, offerings to girl's arrival tightening pressure. Protagonist agency in painting glyphs drives deepening; visible cost in solitude foreclosed by invitation, though no sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of dormant empathy/remembrance emerges organically from glyph transmissions and ripple effects, avoiding statement; final shared glyph answers "you are not alone" non-literally, reweighting premise with communal resonance. Complexity lingers in city's weary learning without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in lunar-ink imagery and biased noticing (moonlight daydreams over smog); single POV stable, voice rhythmic and modulating with ritual calm to saffron quiet peak. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual in girl's whisper advancing closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., brush description pulses resonance and backstory); rhythmic variety, no loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (spilled ink silence, seeds empathy). Propulsion aligns with accumulative builds, clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical glyphs encoding lost kindness awakens city empathy, transforming trope of isolated artist via ripple mechanics. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically; "hand that gives water" glyph moment inflects non-obviously toward communal payoff.</comment>
