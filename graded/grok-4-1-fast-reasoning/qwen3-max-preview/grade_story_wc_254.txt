<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation (tremor rooting chest like seed cracking stone) and micro-choices under pressure (kneeling to converse, uttering "Unfold") reveal hierarchy of values, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, preventing 9+ entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase (pillars whispering to auroras spiraling) tightening to Charged Poise closure; her step onto shimmering ice reconfigures boundaries with felt cost of 17-year wait, legible in "scorch her palms."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quartz colonnade and frozen lake constrain choices (barefoot on glacial marble, lake cracking in response) and charge final image (step across ice to commune); sensory hierarchy (hum only silence-memorizers hear) filters through aesthetic POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (touch untouchable after ban) escalates via agency-driven deepening ("Unfold" spirals harmonics, forcing dance); cost unmistakable in causal evolution from threshold hesitation to ice communion, foreclosing isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sacred boundaries softening emerges organically from particulars (paraphrasing hymn into questions, membranes thinning); final shimmering lake offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (translating geometry into motion) and rhythmic control (caesura pauses in dance) sustain lyric compression, taught early; single-word "Unfold" pays off as voice peak without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm sync to quartz hum, but figurative density borders overwriting in mid-beats (light/sound/shadow bends) without uniform muddle; no loops, closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-ban aesthetic communion transforms trope of artistic exile; risk-taking in lyric voice (lantern-moth hush modulating to god-throat crack) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
