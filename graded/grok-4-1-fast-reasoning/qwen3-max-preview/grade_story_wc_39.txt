<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation in daily rituals and child exchange; interior contradiction shines in shift from survival pennies to redemptive jars, but music box "understood his true motivation" verges on unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of jar captures building to CR closure in poet's death and humming loft; cost legible in final poem's "vagrant, then a vessel" reconfiguring legacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dunes, salt-wind, and loft constrain wandering and storage, charging final image of feral loft brimming with sonic reliquaries; sensory hierarchy (sounds dominant) reflects poet's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of continuity escalates accumulatively from music box repair to child jar handover, forcing endurance with felt cost of orphan past; child scene crystallizes but lacks micro-turn reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of echoes stitching generations emerges organically via jars, reweighted non-literally in final jars "humming when the wind blew just right"; no moralizing despite poem's resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable with sound-biased perceptual signature; sparse dialogue natural and goal-driven in child exchange, voice modulating tenderly under winter pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion varies with scene breath, high density in jar labels; "gleaned" motif patterns without loop excess, but minor figurative density ("tide-water in hollows") borders overwrought in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ingenious sound-jars transform vagrant trope into fresh sonic reliquaries; risk-taking lyric bio shards heighten continuity stakes, inevitable in hindsight via dawn bookends.</comment>
