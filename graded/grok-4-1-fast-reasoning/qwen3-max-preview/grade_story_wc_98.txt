<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to protect memory is embodied in doubt pricking him amid ritual actions, with contradictory impulses (intuition vs. fear of misinterpretation) acting simultaneously before the seed's split earns closure; mentor's recalled voice reinforces without unearned epiphany. Flawless under single-POV defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ritual details builds to tremor and seed's split as Resonant Reconfiguration (fractal archive), with legible cost ("The knowledge fruit seed was gone") reweighting premise; orientation anchored by ~50 words, single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ridge's dew-laced grass, opal petals, and erupting vines constrain ritual choices and charge final hovering miniature ridge; sensory hierarchy (scents trigger recall) reflects Aris's priorities, integrated into action without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor memory pre-monsoon) signaled early, escalates via density increase (vines/glyphs) and doubt-deepening that narrows interpretive options; one tightening (tremor as awakening) forces stance crystallization with felt weariness cost, but minor abstractness in village examples slightly mutes on-page legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragile dream-memory emerges organically via glyphs releasing particulars (heron-son, salt-bread), culminating in final image repricing doubt as "lantern" without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer to erosion risk via autonomous archive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature ("empirically whimsical" filter on symbols like blue serpent); rhythmic modulation peaks in tremor beat, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at seed-split closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., vines "threaded with glyphs that flickered like fireflies caught in amber" advances memory stakes); figurative consistency in lyric mode avoids muddle, but minor density overload in opening ridge description slightly slows initial momentum—no loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-verification as measurable magic transforms folklore tropes; risk-taking in fractal self-correcting archive feels inevitable from prior particulars, heightening conceptual stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
