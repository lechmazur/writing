<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hesitation at reaching for Lirien reveals contradictory impulses acting simultaneously with fracture risk as embodied cost. Interiority concrete via pulsing card searing palm and memory fragments like melting cake. Minor abstract phrasing ("blissfully aberrant") borders diagnostic but ties to micro-choices like mirror whispers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of memory shards and ship decay builds to garden CR where "I am both. And neither. And all." reconfigures identity with legible fracture cost. Orientation anchored early at prow/ship/bay; no penalty. Single scene descent/ascent tightens meaningfully without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Recurring ship elements (carousel horses, mirror maze, pistons) constrain choices and charge final prow image. Sensory selection (copper/cinnamon air, oil-slick constellations) reflects POV urgency/mismatch. Card as micro-setting enables valve access and dulls post-payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapture self) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via card-flare/door to garden hesitation tightening options (whole or fracture). Agency in murmuring acceptance forecloses path with felt cost. Pressure coheres under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of paradoxical identity emerges organically from garden particulars, reweighted by final "trapped freedom...if you chose the bars" without moralizing. Closing image resonates non-literally on premise. Subtext in mirror invitations and name float carries ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature via fused-mind distortions (two voices, altering memories). Lyrical rhythm modulates with intensity, compression purposeful in descent hums. No head-hopping; diction biased to aberrant lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Purposeful figurative density (petals like letters) taught early as lyric pattern, no muddle in peak hesitation. Minor overwrite in engine room evaporates under accumulative intent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garden of names synthesizes aberrant identity and ship decay into inevitable CR, transforming carnival trope boldly. Risk in lyric mosaic of memories heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh angle on self-reclamation via swatch-card mechanic.</comment>
