<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via trembling hand steadied by humming, earning scar transformation; interiority concrete in wrist tingles shifting from pain to warmth; micro-choices reveal values hierarchy with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rune-writing density builds to cadence shift at final "breathe" rune, yielding Conceptual Repricing of scars as waypoints; orientation anchored early in platform scene; cost legible in shed shame without erasure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating platform constrains via vibrations/resonance, charging closure harmony; quill ink and wrist scars as micro-settings limit/reward actions; sensory details (steaming tea, crystallized ink threat) selectively mirror internal release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scar transformation) signaled early, tightens texturally through rune progression and stress prevention; humming agency forecloses crystallization path with felt cost; pressure coheres accumulatively to Charged Poise sip.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of pain-alchemization emerges organically from rune particulars shifting scars to "waypoints"; final tea-sky reflection reweights premise non-literally; earned insight avoids platitudes via concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with rune-scholar perceptual bias (ink properties, geomantic currents); lyrical diction/rhythm modulates intensity purposefully; no head-hopping, perceptual signature distinct in idiomatic fantasy lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene breath (short hum lines amid longer flows); high density integrates action/atmosphere without loops or scaffolds; figurative language purposeful/consistent, no muddle in peak rune strokes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rune scars-to-stories premise freshly synthesizes superstition with scholarship; platform resonance and ink trait transform trope of magical failure; risk-taking in held-breath stasis heightens lyric stakes organically.</comment>
