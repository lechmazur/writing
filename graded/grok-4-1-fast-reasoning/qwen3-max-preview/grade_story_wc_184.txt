<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong rooted motivation in patient reconfiguration, shown through concrete actions like threading the seal; interiority particular via puzzle-solving thrill without stock epiphanies. Lacks overt contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, tilting toward competence over struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from scattered fragments to synchronized clock hum, culminating in RR closure as door dissolves post-reweaving—"no longer needed"—with conceptual cost of integrating absence. Orientation anchors immediately in tower climb; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rope and seal as micro-setting constrain choice and charge final pendulum arc; sensory details (brass oil, ticking stutter) filter through archivist's methodical bias, evolving causally with reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to resolve anomaly tightens accumulatively as weave syncs clock rhythm, narrowing to Charged Poise; agency in patient threading forecloses anomalous door with legible reconfiguration cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of weaving absences emerges organically via seal-into-rope merge, resonant in final ledger note repricing fables as "pauses waiting for hands"; non-literal closure image reweights entropy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing ("logic of the weave as if... editing"); rhythmic diction modulates from exploratory to assured, compression purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels via integrated action-description; minor repetitive stems ("not by force, but by") voice-motivated for emphasis, no loops dulling closure image of settling rope.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival puzzle and temporal anomaly via braid-reconfiguration transforms haunted-tower trope; risk in lyric accumulative closure heightens conceptual stakes inevitably.</comment>
