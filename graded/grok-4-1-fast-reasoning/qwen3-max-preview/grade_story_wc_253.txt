<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Blank-faced performer's contradictory impulses—defiance in whittling erosion, compliance in box carving—act simultaneously, earning final endurance with cost of emotional void shown in flat narration and micro-choices like lying to officers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from whittling rituals to box preparation/presentation, landing Charged Poise/CR in whisper amid stalled turbine silence ("I miss you"), reweighting compliance as armor with legible cost of "lighter, emptier" survival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Turbines as skeletal sentinels constrain choices (shadowed whittling, remade hush mandates grief's silence) and charge final image (stalled blade yields true silence for whisper), with sensory pine shavings and dust integrating via POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief survival under Happiness Decree) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via officer visits and box ploy narrowing options to ambiguous endurance; cost felt in hollowed self post-presentation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief carved into tolerated shapes emerges organically from whittling/box acts; final image ("whittling absence into artifact") offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting mandate via lingering ghost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct flat-performative texture (e.g., "The knife meets grain. Resistance is minimal"); dialogue sparse/natural, carrying subtext in compliance lie; rhythm modulates tension without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short narrated strokes vs. longer reflections); purposeful figurative layering (shavings as ghosts) serves accumulative texture without muddle or loops, propelling to closure whisper.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian mandate with whittling-as-defiance transforms tropes; risky void-tone and turbine hush premise commit boldly, with box carving turn inevitable from established rituals.</comment>
