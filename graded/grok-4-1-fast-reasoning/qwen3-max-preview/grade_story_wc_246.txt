<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation to thresh meaning intensifies through embodied actions like clutching the pen and tracing the glyph, revealing confidently uncertain trait via micro-choices under anomaly pressure. Interiority concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses (rigid syntax unbending into ellipses) acting in scene. Final endurance of fluidity earned by prior causality, foreclosing control with felt cost in the blooming past.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from listening to glyph-tracing, culminating in CR closure where final image ("wet clay—malleable, messy, and still warm") reconfigures history's rule-set with conceptual cost of impermanence. Orientation anchored early (interpreter at anomaly post-seeds). One tightening via glyph suffices, pattern taught immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly as setting constrains choices (rippling ground, bending light pressure glyph-tracing), with pen as recurring micro-setting charging final glow. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (stars whispering backward, tidal throb). Details integrated into action, mirroring internal fluidity without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thresh meaning from paradoxes) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via edits unknotted like shoelace, narrowing to fluid acceptance. Agency in inviting contingencies forces renunciation of control, with cost legible in "strange comfort" of messiness. Guardrail met: tightening forecloses fixity in edited examples (war to dinners).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fluid history emerges organically from particulars (fallen tree re-rooting, unsent letters as conversations), reweighted non-literally in final image of blooming corrections answering "wrong tense" seeds. Subtext in contingent edits resists tidy morals, embracing ambiguity with emotional aftereffect of dancing grammar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single POV stable with perceptual signature (syntax as punctuation dissolving, stars garbled by entropy). Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates poetically under pressure, prose as character in "confidently uncertain" texture. Purposeful non-standard grammar (ellipses, unpunctuated flow) taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "light bent in lazy spirals" advances atmosphere/action); rhythm varies read-aloud, propulsion syncs scene (slow throb to shimmering glyph). Minor overwrite in metaphor density ("thresher on broken gears") but coherent, no loops or muddle touching closure; syntactic variety emphasizes key images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi anomaly as narrative editor transforms tropes (time travel via glyph/contingencies) into inevitable fluidity, risking lyrical compression that heightens stakes. Original premise angle on regret as metaphysical seeds; final "dancing with its grammar" inflects boldly without gimmickry.</comment>
