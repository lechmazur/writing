<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied actions like fingers tracing epitaph grooves and retracing poems syllable-by-syllable; motivation to map collective grief drives carving strangers' stones with felt progression to acceptance. Minor slip in archetypal "fiercely meditative" label without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Final endurance earned by spectral guidance buildup, no unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred early via meditative buildup of ribbons, butterflies, and spectral pressure; holds to Conceptual Repricing closure where Elias joins grief's migration ("no longer carving alone"). Orientation anchored in opening sentence; cost legible in final chisel pickup amid thunder, reconfiguring isolation. One tightening via final crimson ribbon suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting (moss-slicked flagstones, iron rafters, lemon tree) constrains carving and ribbon-tying, charges final indigo dusk image; butterflies brushing panes echo internal migration. Sensory hierarchy meditative: tactile grooves, visual violet panes. Recurrent ribbons as object-setting evolve to whisper poems.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover grief's geometry) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via spectral wrist-guidance and ribbon web during migration; one tightening in Silas stepping beside for palm-over-heart forces stance crystallization. Cost felt in ongoing carving renunciation of void-filling. Butterfly migration complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief as winged migration emerges organically from ribbon knots, chiseled vessels, poem fragments; final image ("picked up his chisel again... smiled, for he was no longer carving alone") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting absence into current. No moralizing; ambiguity in collective vs. personal lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single close-third POV with perceptual signature (letters as vessels, grief's geometry); rhythmic modulation peaks in "thundering calm" carving rhythm syncing butterfly flutter. Purposeful compression taught early via meditative elision; diction controlled, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "wings brushing the panes like parchment against stone" advances setting, echo, rhythm); varied syntax/paragraphs propel accumulatively. Minor figurative density in opening beats ("unspooling like a sigh") borders overwriting but pattern-taught as lyric motif without muddle or closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravestone carving as grief-geometry mapped via spectral hand, poem-ribbons, butterfly migration in greenhouse; ribbons' evolution from keepsake to memory-loom feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric Accumulative structure heightens meditative stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
