<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Charmed skeptic's interiority shines in embodied dread "pooling in her ribs" and unflinching cataloging of memories, revealing contradictory impulses of cynicism versus listening; final vow as micro-choice earns sovereignty with emotional cost of foreclosing healing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of memory lattices building to pattern break at shell's "final harmonic surge" into silence/completion (Charged Poise RR); on-page cost legible in time thinning and archived past, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory selectivity (vines "curled gently around her ankles," jasmine thick with ghosts) anchors twilight garden; constrains via dawn pressure and willow roots cradling shell, charging final image of moss placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to archive before dissolution escalates texturally as shell "pulsed warmer," whispers clearer, forcing vow that crystallizes stance; agency in listening/placing shell forecloses dissolution path with felt void cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief-to-structure emerges organically via lattices translating pain to "compass"; final silhouette against dawn offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting isolation as fluency, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in "geometries of grief, lattices of longing"; rhythmic modulation peaks at vow's sparse "silence. Not emptiness. Completion," no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric rhythm, varied openings; minor deduction for figurative saturation (e.g., supernovas, lattices) bordering overwrite in reflective beats, but no loops or scaffold dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific "resonance structures" alchemizing quarantined memories into sovereignty transforms grief tropes; bold lyric risk in archiving vow heightens stakes organically.</comment>
