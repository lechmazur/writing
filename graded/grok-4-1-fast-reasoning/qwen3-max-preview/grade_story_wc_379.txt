<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's micro-choices like off-key humming embody discerning trait under persistence pressure, earning Leo's change with relational cost. Internal conflict subtle but present in restraint from opening mailbox.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via resonance density to RR closure: mailbox "exhales," locket softens with Leo's tears as felt emotional cost. Shards transition legibly, one tightening via fourth humming suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Courtyard jasmine/dew and locket warmth constrain choices, charge final image; sensory hierarchy POV-biased to emotional pulls over visuals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resolving locket's grief signaled early; daily humming escalates accumulatively, narrowing Leo's isolation with visible endurance cost. Agency in persistence forecloses inaction path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of trauma's echoes healed by listening emerges organically via locket hum, mailbox rite, seashell reprise; final image reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "hearing" objects; sparse dialogue subtextual ("I hear things"), advances stake. Stable single-POV, rhythmic modulation under emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates sense/action; varied rhythm propels without loops, purposeful metaphors like "trapped wing" avoid muddle in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grieving locket/mailbox "exhale" ingeniously transforms curator trope into resonance mechanics; risk of alive mailbox heightens stakes organically.</comment>
