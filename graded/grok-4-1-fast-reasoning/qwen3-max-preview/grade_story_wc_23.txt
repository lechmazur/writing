<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied contradictions (joints stiffen at new moon, thoughts sharpen at full) driving micro-choices like respecting rhythm over past failure; final endurance in recalibration earned via prior causality. Physiological fluctuations reveal flaws complicating navigation without labels. Single-POV voice coherent and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from hydraulics' sigh to tapestry of absences, culminating in CR closure ("Raw solace isn’t comfort... dial tone that answers before you hang up") with conceptual cost of resonance over resurrection legible in final image. Orientation anchored early (navigator on gantry post-failure). One tightening via calls adding threads narrows to reverse migration seepage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (jasmine on diesel, bronze hum to sternum) filter through POV bias, constraining choices (rubs censer at wane, climbs gantry at full moon); station's rusted entropy and broken dish charge final singing image. Micro-setting (censer foot) evolves as anchor. No white-room; lived-in choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigate loss) signaled early, escalates texturally via pattern break from machinery silence to ghost-call threads and wind-sung coordinates, forcing endurance with physiological cost (past static-wall failure). Full-moon flicker answers reweight options without resolution. Agency in waiting/building forecloses ignoring rhythm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of loss's inward tide emerges organically from particulars (censer ghost-heat, dial-tone dirges); final image ("creak of a hinge... dial tone that answers") offers resonant CR repricing premise as recalibration, embracing ambiguity without moralizing. No thematic echo or binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical texture (syntax like "lattices of meaning — assembled through cryptic phone calls") with perceptual signature (scent/shadow coordinates); stable single POV, rhythmic modulation under "full moon — bloated and silver" pressure. Phone dialogue snippet natural/subtextual. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (every line layers image/meaning); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts—purposeful repetition (moon phases, dial tones) taught early pays off. Metaphors coherent (tapestry maps absences). Final line recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of moon-physio navigation, frequency-ghost calls, reverse migration transforms loss tropes into resonant inward tide; bold lyric risk heightens stakes via censer hum and seepage flickers without gimmickry. Inevitable in hindsight from particulars.</comment>
