<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly as scientist-child during starlings' dance, compelling surrender; final vessel-like change earned via prior sentimentality and fear, with tear as embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from crystal/flame to starlings' resonance, landing Charged Poise/CR closure in "She rose... flameless but alight," reweighting fear with soul-cost reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard/waterfall constrains ritual via responsive sighs/blossoms, charging final image; body (knees in roots, palms cupping) and crystal as micro-settings shape awakening beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonize logic/wonder) signaled early, tightens via starlings' arcs mirroring spirals, forcing intuitive surrender with felt marrow-hum/emotional cost charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from crystal memories to journal's dual script; final "wonder... truest name" non-literally reweights premise via particulars, inviting ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature ("reading braille left by forgotten gods"); rhythmic modulation peaks in hum/crystal swirl, eliding nothing unearned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but stacked metaphors in climax ("light swirling... orchard sighed") slightly muddle propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical ritual via starlings' runes/crystal memories transforms tropes; risk-taking lyric compression inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
