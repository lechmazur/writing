<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Diminutive titan's motivation rooted in exile and brother's stolen face compels subtle micro-choices like marginalia and pellet placement, earning her final refusal as Earned Stasis with hollow echo of justice as felt cost. Contradictory impulses surface in no-triumph emergence amid kneeling witnesses. Internal voice particular and embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds via rune messages eroding pretender's lie to CR closure: skin sigils reveal usurper, reweighting truth with delayed-justice cost legible in her "hollow echo." Orientation anchored in first paragraph; shards transition legibly via time markers, lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dust motes, tombstones-books, starlight constrain choices (silent footfalls, hidden traces) and charge final open-book image. Sensory hierarchy (scaled fingers on marble, ink density) reflects titan's priorities; setting evolves causally from pause to realignment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmask pretender) signaled early tightens texturally via converging witnesses to revelation, narrowing to her stance crystallization in refusal; cost unmistakable in people's weeping and her wandering identity. Agency drives via message runes forcing pretender's font-dip exposure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-eroding-mirror emerges organically from ink reaction and "graceful collapse," reweighting crown as carried burden in final line without moralizing; rune motif shifts from tactic to self-conception, inviting ambiguity on worship's peril.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (patience "colder than stars," ink as "grief"); rhythm modulates from meditative setup to charged climax speech. Experimental poetic compression taught early, legible at her "soft as settling ash" emergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density and propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm, but figurative density ("ink bleeding through parchment," "pollen on the wind") borders overwriting in setup without harming closure image. Zero loops; opening/final lines recharge motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of titan exile, ink-alchemy revelation, and drift-rune philosophy transforms usurpation trope; risk-taking in poetic mosaic heightens erosion stakes, inevitable in hindsight via pellet reprise.</comment>
