<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's mellow therapist traits drive micro-choices like wordless singing and passing the curl, with embodied serenity (pocket anchor) under eclipse pressure; internal conflict subtle in mission's open seeding. Minor therapy-speak in "nurture lifelong wonder" abstracts slightly without embodied cost. Strong individual voice over stereotype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: eclipse density gathers participants, culminating in Charged Poise RR as curl passes and wonder seeds with felt cost of personal relinquishment in "now resting in the little girl’s cupped palms." Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early at Sage Ridge. No causal breaks; one tightening via eclipse suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sage Ridge hollow constrains gathering and singing choice, charging final image of ridge echoing child's vow; sensory hierarchy (sage, moss, half-light) POV-filtered through Elara's attuned presence. Junipers and roots evolve with eclipse hush, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (quilt, lyre) tactile and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nurture wonder) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via eclipse drawing crowd and shared hush forcing adaptive harmony; agency in passing curl forecloses personal anchor with on-page cost. One decisive density increase suffices; no abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ordinary magic theme emerges organically from particulars (curl gleam, shared breath), final image of passed curl and "seeded" mission reweights premise non-literally with ambiguity of fragile continuity. No moralizing; subtext in child's whisper invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in tidal fingers and whispering magic biases noticing; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("What’s that?"). Rhythm modulates from honeyed strum to velvet pause under eclipse pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyric metaphors (honeyed chord dissolving into soil); minor overwriting in stacked images ("whispered, waited, and wove") but pattern-taught early, no loops obscuring closure. Varied syntax propels to eclipse peak; ear-test rhythmic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eclipse hush, baby curl anchor, and adaptive lullaby transforms wonder trope into textured seeding of communal magic; curl reprise inevitable in hindsight, risk in quiet passivity heightens stakes without gimmick.</comment>
