<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve via nuance is rooted in grandmother's wisdom and past failures, compelling endurance; interiority concrete in chime-handling and name-whispering. Micro-choices like tilting chime reveal values. Minor weakness: embodied contradictions subtle, more atmospheric than visceral in peak ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds ritual pattern to Charged Poise closure in fading light ("The light didn’t last. It never did."), reweighting preservation stake with impermanence cost. Orientation anchored early in library-clouds. Lens holds cleanly; single scene with routine shards fits defaults.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains via porous architecture enabling wind-resonance and mist-stair climb; recurring cracked chime charges final nesting image. Sensory selective (echoes, dew-brush, light-blooms) through POV's listening bias. Atmosphere foxglove-hued mirrors absences perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve nuance vs. forceful restoration) signaled early via rules/past falterers; ritual whisper deepens via fading light, foreclosing resurrection under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in evanescence charging poise. Agency in vow-kept smile/endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of imperfection-as-aperture emerges from chime-crack and light-on-absences; final nook-remembrance reconfigures preservation question non-literally. Subtext in tending emptiness avoids sentimentality. Resonance from particulars, no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature: memory-glows light path, names ripple light. Lyrical diction/rhythm modulates ritual intensity purposefully; pattern-taught compression legible. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm; figurative language consistent in lyric pattern without muddle. Minor scaffold in repetitive "older than" phrasing, but no loops dulling closure. Propulsion strong to final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Surreal synthesis of extinct-emotions museum, name-lights, crack-mouth ghosts transforms tropes organically. Bold imagery (grief-vellum, sky-whales nook) inevitable in hindsight; risk heightens without obscurity.</comment>
