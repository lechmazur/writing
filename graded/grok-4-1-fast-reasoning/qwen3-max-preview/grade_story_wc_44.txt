<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to literally trace shadows drives consistent micro-choices like winding the forbidden key despite warnings, earning her transformation into threshold-keeper. Quietly deliberate trait embodies in recording amid unraveling rather than fleeing, revealing hierarchy of scholarly values over fear. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak ritual beats, but change feels earned without unmotivated epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: nightly rituals densify knowledge from key's resonance to shadows' sealed nature, culminating in on-page CR as she steps through threshold, palm burning with recursion—legible conceptual cost of becoming the loop. Orientation anchors early (Elira in Vaelis observatory post-spoons). Single scene coheres with one tightening: realization shadows remember path, enabling crossing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating isle observatory with cracked dome and orrery constrains choices—key inserted there triggers reversal—charging final image of drifting isle under her rearranged stars. Sensory hierarchy scholarly: ink-stained fingers on glyphs, spine-vibrating hum, wall-whispers. Details evolve causally (runes flare cobalt-gold-black) without tourist catalog; recurring spoon (never hit ground) mirrors paradox.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shadows' noon path) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ritual deepening—seventeenth night forces stance crystallization as keeper. Agency in winding/repeating/stepping forecloses observer path with recursion-burn cost felt on-page. One tightening sufficient; no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of equilibrium via loops emerges organically from ritual particulars—shadows shift from excised to partners—resonant CR in final rune ΘΑΛΗΣ-9 and noon shadowing time, reweighting spoon-bend premise without moralizing. Subtext in silence's theft vs. relearning charges ambiguity of absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature: deliberate scholarly noticing (glyph-mismatch, gear-backspin). Lyrical voice modulates rhythm for resonance (short declarative rituals amid poetic density), consistent syntax reflecting quiet precision. No dialogue; purposeful compression of nights legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "key didn’t open locks. It opened thresholds" advances plot/foreshadows). Rhythmic variety in read-aloud (mix fragments, compounds); metaphors coherent (serpent-tail loop, liquid night shadows). Minor overwriting in early figurative density (reality spirals, lunar frost) approaches but doesn't obscure peak; no loops or scaffolds dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: spoons expose physics seams, shadows as sealed consciousnesses reconciled via rune-key loops—inevitable hindsight from early paradox. Bold risk in literal noon-shadow quest avoids trope (magical fix); transforms fantasy via scholarly equilibrium calculus.</comment>
