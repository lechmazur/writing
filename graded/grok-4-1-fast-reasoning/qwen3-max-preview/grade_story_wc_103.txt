<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation to feel time's grain drives micro-choices like barefoot walk and final caress, earning symbiotic acceptance with embodied cost in tear-sprouting wood; interiority particular via tasted rain and unfelt hands, though occasional diagnostic labels slightly abstract contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as perceptual layers build to CR closure in "She smiled, trembling, the quaking reverie complete," reweighting premise with memory disintegration cost; orientation anchored by ~50 words, one tightening via fragment brush pays off without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden's pulsing leaves and yew tunnel constrain perceptional choices, charging final halo caress; sensory hierarchy (dew ankles, thorn soles) reflects Elira's texture quest, integrated purposefully without static catalogs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (time's texture) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via inversion/disintegration narrowing to reverie endurance; agency in fragment adjustments forces trade-off with photo ash cost legible on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of time's tactile emotions emerges via particulars like porous joy and slick regret, resonant non-literal answer in final spectrum reweighting garden-memory symbiosis without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature in temporal synesthesias (rain taste, backward laughter); rhythmic modulation peaks in terse "Not burned. Not torn. Disintegrated," sustaining lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and image layering, passing ear test; figurative coherence in inversion beat ("roots ceilings, blossoms dripped upward") purposeful without muddle, minor overwriting density nudges down from peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry folding time/memories into textured emotions synthesizes fresh inevitability, risk-taking in lyric reverie heightens stakes via symbiotic wound without gimmickry.</comment>
