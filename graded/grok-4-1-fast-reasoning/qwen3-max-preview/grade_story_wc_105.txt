<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular through synesthetic hearing and marrow-monitoring; motivation intensifies via sister's absence fed to forge, earning final endurance with embodied cost ("thin from hunger, spirit scarred"). Contradictory impulses in grief-alchemy act in forging scene. 9+ test met: final renunciation ("won't return") earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to "crack," cadence shifts to Charged Poise closure as she pulls device and leaves, reconfiguring silence into compass with cost ("weary but unbroken"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in "leaving the forge to cool" and refusal to return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory hierarchy via POV (violet hum, crimson cello) selective and purposeful; setting constrains choice (resonance only here) and charges final image (wrecks resonate post-imprint). Micro-setting (forge, device) evolves causally. 9+ test: greenhouse/shipwrecks pressure forging and payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hear trust break) signaled early, deepens via "crack" after feeding absence; agency in imprinting narrows options to warning-device. Cost unmistakable in bodily/spiritual toll charging final climb. Escalation textural via sound-density under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (grief to guidance) emerges from forging absences, no statements; final image ("memory-catcher... warm as heartbeat") reweights premise non-literally. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes. 9+ test: ending answers "trust fracture" via compass without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with synesthetic perceptual signature ("heard colors faintly"); voice texture modulates rhythmically (short "crack" lines under stress). No elision or head-hopping. 9+ test: rhythmic control heightens pressure, signature consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm (e.g., staccato post-crack); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled figures—synesthesia consistent. Propulsion peaks at "froze. That was it." 9+ test: zero artifacts, propulsion clear to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, absence-forge, cellular time transforms grief trope organically; risk in lyric accumulation heightens closure without gimmick. Inevitable hindsight via "sound of trust breaking" payoff. 9+ test: non-obvious premise inevitable, risk elevates stakes.</comment>
