<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive trait embodied in unflinching persistence amid failures, with contradictory impulses (purity vs. error) acting in ritual micro-choices; earned change in "He smiled—not in triumph, but recognition" forecloses perfection path with prior failure costs. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "interrupt a stifling destiny" borders tell but anchors motive without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds iteratively to closure CR in "destruction had been the wrong word all along. It was deconstruction," reweighting failures as scaffold with conceptual cost of shattered expectations; orientation anchored early in nexus at twilight; one tightening via nexus thrum response narrows to motion over mastery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains ritual via powdered moonstone/bronze access and responsive thrum/shadows; sensory hierarchy (tectonic thrum, indigo syrup, frost bloom) filters alchemist priorities, charges final "frozen bloom...melt[ing] into light" image; spatial coherence in lap-to-circle placement tracks cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vivify to break failure destiny) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through approximation beats (whisper equations to blood/stir corrections) reweighting options; agency in softening cadence forces trade-off, cost legible in "bruised violet" eyes and prior spills now harmonized ghosts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of iteration/deconstruction emerges organically from failure ghosts to "becoming the road," resonant non-literal answer in crozier's reborn voids; ambiguity lingers in mid-miracle without tidy moral, reweights prior via "seed beneath could stretch."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd perceptual signature via alchemical bias (equations as pleas, air bent like heat haze); rhythmic control modulates with intensity, compression in peak "air cracked like ice"; purposeful lyric diction taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "shadows peeled...curling like ink" advances action/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud, no loops/artifacts; figurative coherence in alchemical vehicles supports propulsion without muddle in frost bloom climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical failure-as-creation with crozier rebirth transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulation heightens resonance without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight via "iterate, fail, adapt" to portable nexus.</comment>
