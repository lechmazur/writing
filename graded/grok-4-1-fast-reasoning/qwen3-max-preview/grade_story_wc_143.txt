<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in "quiet ache" propel micro-choices like labeling the hourglass, earning her shift to vigil; embodied emotions (throat tight, bitter smile) show contradiction without therapy-speak. Minor abstraction in reflective summaries slightly dilutes simultaneous impulses during the grain's fall.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from ascent to "final grain dissolving mid-fall," landing Charged Poise CR closure in "She carried the image in her chest now" with emotional cost of isolation legible. Orientation anchors immediately; single scene holds without shards or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sensory details like "boots crunching softly over regolith" and dawn's "pale gold" filter through inspector's priorities, constraining suit-bound actions and charging final shadow image. Spatial choreography coherent; lunar vacuum subtly guides chem-reaction timing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake to witness/photograph tightens via countdown ("04:57 Lunar Standard") under Accum lens, forcing endurance with throat-tight cost; agency in framing shots and labeling forecloses detachment. Escalation coheres without reversal need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of unheard persistence emerges organically from hourglass legend and her "vow: I was here when it ended," resonating in non-literal whisper finale without moralizing. Final image reweights obsolescence as "beauty intact," embracing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in poetic-scientific noticing ("sodium metasilicate layered with lunar ilmenite"); rhythmic modulation peaks at hush deepening, diction controlled without filter excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density and propulsion in lines like "message wrapped in erosion"; varied rhythm passes ear test, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image despite "last" pattern (taught early, purposeful).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chem-hourglass relic and vigil transforms lunar trope into elegy; "harmonic resonance tuned to... 2047" inflects ingenuity with conceptual cost, risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes.</comment>
