<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority via pulsing scars and trembling knuckles revealing contradictory resolve; earns final step-through as teacher via prior betrayal scars; minor abstraction in "teach suffocating to breathe" dilutes peak embodiment without cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echoes and ripples tightens to Charged Poise closure as threshold dissolves with felt release cost ("doorknocker clattered... purpose spent"); orientation anchored early in sanctuary under starlight; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ashen charcoal dust and starlight pooling constrain bare-foot steps and anoint collarbone, charging final lantern-field image; selective sensory hierarchy (taste of burnt sugar/tears) mirrors ritual urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching breath via absence) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through met-echoes with stillness and scar-palm press narrowing to dissolution; agency in exhale/whisper forces reconfiguration with sanctuary-sigh cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of healing via "measured silence" emerges organically from scar-threads and unlit lanterns reweighting suffocation premise; final "stop fighting the shape of your own throat" resonates non-literally without moralizing, inviting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (scars as mechanism, breath stirring ash) stable in single close-third POV; rhythmic modulation builds to hushed cadence at "You are allowed to gasp"; purposeful elision of reunion pays off in expanse image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, but repeated "burns bridges carefully" refrain borders template cadence across three instances without full pattern payoff; figurative stack ("ink in rain," "burnt sugar") coherent yet heavy in peak dissolve beat dulls slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scar-weaving ritual transforms bridge-burning trope into indispensable healing mechanism; bold lyric risk in echo-stillness progression heightens stakes organically to lantern-field repricing.</comment>
