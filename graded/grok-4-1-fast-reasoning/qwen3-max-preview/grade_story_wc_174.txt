<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular through embodied actions like tracing charred grooves and puppet-building from manuscripts; contradictory impulses (past evasion vs. accountability) act in reflections, earning final serenity with relational cost to Mira. Self-puppet moment reveals flaw under pressure without safety-hedging. 9+ test passed: final earned change forecloses evasion path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: reflective shards build density to CR closure ("serenity wasn’t cultivated—it was earned") with conceptual cost (forward sincerity via subversion). Orientation anchored early (calligrapher in dome); backstory interleaves with micro-choices like whispering lines. No disorientation; pattern taught immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dome's rivets-as-eyes and rain-Morse selectively mirror internal hush, constraining solitary rehearsal and charging final shadows/breath image. Recurrent candle/stick as micro-setting enables epiphanies. 9+ test: environment charges final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical reversal) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening reflections/bar violence to stance crystallization; agency in enduring bottle-throw alters tactics. Cost legible in "violence as punctuation." Enters 8+ via trade-off but minor abstractness in some stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of accountability emerges organically from puppet twists and stick insights, culminating in non-literal CR ("turning embers into light") reweighting prior evasion. Resists tidy morals via ambiguity (Mira may hate title). 9+ test: resonant answer without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with perceptual signature (half-lit whispers, flickering motives); rhythmic prose modulates from hush to shimmer without head-hopping. Lyrical compression taught early, legible at closure. 9+ test: signature holds under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (short whispers amid long shadows). Minor overwrought metaphors ("velvet fog") in opening but purposeful, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image. No filter stacks; clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligraphy/puppets for ethical subversion transforms tropes; bar shows and self-puppet risk heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from stick's guidance. 9+ test: non-obvious angle inevitable.</comment>
