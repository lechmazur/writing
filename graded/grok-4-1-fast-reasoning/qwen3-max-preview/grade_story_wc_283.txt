<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent motivation in humility of small things compels shift from solitary work to sharing jars, earned via button placement; embodied in calloused fingers and patient spirals. Minor abstraction in interiority lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density to pivotal button placement causing echo's clear speech ("The future is not foretold; it is folded"), tightening to CR closure in final weaving image with conceptual cost of world's unraveling vs. assembly below. Orientation anchored early; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring jar and buttons constrain choices (e.g., cross-referencing spirals) and charge final image of gleaming buttons under lantern light; sensory details (resin/rust, dust motes) filter through POV priorities, mirroring internal humility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of assembling truth amid unraveling world escalates accumulatively via echo's speech, narrowing to sharing jars as Charged Poise; agency in micro-choices like slower hourglass spin shows visible conceptual cost in refusing grandeur.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of prophecy from fragments emerges organically via buttons as choices, resonant in final non-literal image ("stitched in silence, buttoned to the soul"); minor thematic echo in grandmother's tone risks mild preachiness but avoids full moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (buttons as pivots, sand as shedding truth); rhythmic prose modulates effectively, prose-as-character reflects quiet reverence without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively, but paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "unscrambled," "quietly inspired") and heavy figurative layering in peak echo beat dull some propulsion; no closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of buttons as choice archaeology and echo jars transforms prophecy trope into raw possibility; risk-taking in metaphorical world heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via button-to-jars progression.</comment>
