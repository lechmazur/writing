<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (humming in bones, second skeleton) and micro-choices under pressure (entering alcove, touching petal) earn the shift from bewildered to awake; minor abstractness in epiphany ("resonance across possibilities") prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from wandering to glyph/shell/petal CR closure; cost legible in petal memories of alternate selves dissolving into skin, with cameo as persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Astral orchard and cameo constrain inquiry/revelation and charge final image (petals etched with selves); sensory details (ozone/petrichor, embryonic stars) filter through archival POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel nonlinear inheritance) tightens via bathroom deepening that narrows options to chosen/borrowed futures; agency in inquiry/touch forecloses linear view with felt memory cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of resonance across possibilities emerges organically from glyph/shell/petals without statement; final image ("field to be harvested") resonantly reweights "gaps" premise with conceptual cost of multiplicity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (archival metaphors like tuning fork, origami) and rhythmic control modulate from disquiet to awakening; stable single POV with lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("blossoms trembled as if remembering"); minor overwrit in metaphors (e.g., embryonic stars) purposeful for texture but borders coherence in peak revelation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi orchard and bathroom epiphany transforms inheritance trope via nonlinear payoff; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens conceptual stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
