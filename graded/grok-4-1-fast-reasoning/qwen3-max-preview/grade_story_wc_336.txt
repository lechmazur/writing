<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation roots deeply in personal aversion to a wonderless world, shown through embodied tears and micro-choices like distilling specific memories into filaments. Contradictory impulses emerge in her shift from idle tools to essence-weaving, compelling the closure with felt emotional cost. Interiority particular via tree-whispers and child-laughter echoes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: essences weave into density increase, culminating in seed-crack RR (Charged Poise) with legible cost in "tears tracing paths down cheeks weathered by decades." One tightening via tendril's warm curl reconfigures options. Orientation anchored by ~50 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Parapet-moss and waterfall-roar constrain weaving at the "seam," charging final shimmer and knitting veil. Sensory hierarchy (auditory hush, tactile mist) mirrors internal reverence. Micro-setting (parapet trembling in resonance) alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder's color) signaled early, escalates via density of woven filaments to seed-tremble under Accumulative lens, narrowing to her heart-anchoring with tear-cost. Agency in memory-distillation forecloses loss-option. One deepening suffices, charging final belonging-pulse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of wonder-preservation emerges organically from essence-filaments and color-bloom, reweighted in final "seed’s glow answered — not with defiance, but with belonging." Non-literal resonance avoids moralizing, tying to Elira's unyielding heart.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (e.g., "moss that sighed with ancient memory") stable in single close-POV, modulating rhythm to hush-cadence under pressure. Pattern-taught poetic compression legible at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: metaphors cohere in lyric pattern (e.g., "each snip... a stanza"), varying rhythm without loops or scaffolds. No figurative muddle in peak seed-crack; read-aloud reverent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of literal "color of wonder" via essence-weaving transforms mythic tropes; risk-taking in lyric Accumulative structure heightens closure-charge without gimmickry. Inevitable hindsight from seed's child-laughter origin.</comment>
