<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in drumming as quiet rebellion against imposed silence, evolving to earned wholeness; "drumming for the child who forgot her own name" reveals particular motives without labels. Final micro-choice to sing braids voices, foreclosing isolation with weary cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via rising memory tides to garden's responsive bloom; closure as Charged Poise in "She stopped drumming. The garden didn’t," reconfiguring burden to shared rhythm with legible weariness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sonic sculptures and resonant soil constrain and amplify her drift—"each step triggering harmonic chimes"—charging final image where garden carries rhythm; sensory hierarchy narrows to tactile/auditory urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Suffocating memories tighten via collaboration in movement, narrowing to voice-braiding climax; cost unmistakable in "small and weary" smile after weaving, felt in foreclosed silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Burden-to-bridge theme emerges implicitly from particulars like fractured reflection shifting to outward pulse; final "heartbeat she no longer carried alone" reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature in "rhythms only the dead would recognize" biases noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks coherently in singing without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density in multi-job lines like "vines trembled. Pools rippled."; figurative pattern (light/sound) taught early pays off without muddle or loops in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sci-fi grafting transformed via sonic rebellion synthesis feels inevitable; risk in lyric drift heightens stakes, as in lagoon lifting "not to drown, but to lift."</comment>
