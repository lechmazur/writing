<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied regret "settles in your joints" and contradictory memories acting simultaneously; final handover to ghost earns change via prior collecting micro-choices. Contradictory impulses (others' fragments vs. ghost's lens adjustment) compel the closure choice with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of fragments to CR closure in envelope's "frame it," reweighting premise with cost of dissolved ghost and no-regret stasis; orientation anchored early in lagoon/scavenger/ghost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via pooled time enabling confusions that charge camera tactic; recurring camera as micro-setting evolves to shape final image when ghost uses it. Sensory selection (salt-crusted planks, fossilized sighs) filters through scavenger bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiate ghost via collecting) signaled early tightens accumulatively when ghost mimes lens adjustment, narrowing to self-development with agency in handover; cost legible in final no-regret reconfiguration charging ending image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of framing eroded ambition emerges organically from carousel illusion and envelope realization, reweighting prior fragments without moralizing; final image offers non-literal answer via ghost's dissolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in fractured syntax ("time...pools, eddies") biases toward echoes/residue, modulating rhythm with pressure; stable first-person holds lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm and zero loops; metaphors cohere (carousel/gravity, scratched record) without muddle, even in peak spire climb to flash/envelope.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stalled carnival/ghost-self negates ambition trope via camera/envelope repricing; risk in nonlinear confusions heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
