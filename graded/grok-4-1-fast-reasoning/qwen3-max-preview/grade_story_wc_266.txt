<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira's humming and Torvin's ear-to-bark listening embody particular traits under pilgrimage pressure, revealing gentle persistence without stock phrasing. Final vigil earns shared burden reconfiguration with felt cost in lighter steps. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously caps below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from gathering to ridge crest discovery, tightening via artifact find ("child’s shoe, half-buried in clover"). Charged Poise closure lands on-page with cost legible in "burden...carried...differently—shared, sanctified," reweighting leash-break premise. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway details (moss-slick railings, gnarled willow, dry creekbed) constrain choices via "land’s whispered detours," filtering through guides' reverent perception. Star-punch holes evolve as recurring light source, charging final vigil image. Sensory hierarchy matches urgency, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find unused courage) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via path challenges to crest tightening at artifacts. Persistence forecloses direct routes with cost in "indirect routes...reverence." Agency in micro-choices like pausing forks; price shapes vigil.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reserved courage emerges organically from particulars (rusted whistle, hopeful knots), culminating in non-literal CR: star-holes in town crusts reweight premise without moralizing. Final image resonates via shifted meaning of artifacts, inviting ambiguity on reclamation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person voice stable, perceptual bias toward sighs/whispers character-specific. Rhythm modulates (short clicks amid longer descriptions); sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Courage doesn’t rust"). No head-hopping, diction controlled for poetic texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density integrates action/image (fox "vanished into bracken that sighed open"); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful ("roots...like question marks") without muddle in vigil peak. Minor elevated diction fits voice, propels accumulatively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: star-punch as soul-metronome transforms courage-hunt into reverent pilgrimage, risking lyric indirectness that heightens resonance. Artifacts' quiet presence inevitable in hindsight, no tropes unearned.</comment>
