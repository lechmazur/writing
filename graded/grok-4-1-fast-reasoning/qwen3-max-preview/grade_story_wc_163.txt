<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to sync with belonging's rhythm is concrete and intensifies through embodied actions like brushing algae as braille; interiority particular via astrological lens on ruins. Final reconfiguration from disconnection to inhabited purpose earned via feather's arc. Minor slip in occasional abstract therapy-like phrasing ("rhythm of belonging itself") but doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via wonder images to firefly spiral/climax, CR closure in palm-mirror burst scattering fireflies, reweighting solitude with cost of transformed feather ("no longer an ending—but a softly ingenious beginning"). Orientation anchored in first paragraph; one tightening via impossible fireflies suffices. Cost legible in "alone again, but no longer lonely."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selective sensory details (silted heart, anglerfish lanterns) filter through POV's wonder bias, constrain via viewport/cracked dome limiting interaction. Recurring facility/portholes charge final gold-green radiance; micro-object feather evolves to threshold-tuner. Final ascent blush integrates causally with dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging rhythm) signaled early, tightens texturally via firefly alignment to schematic—deepening awe, narrowing to palm-mirror agency foreclosing disconnection. Cost felt in feather cooling post-burst, charging poise. No reversal overload needed; pressure coheres to end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of belonging coaxed from thresholds emerges via feather/fireflies images shifting from loss to liturgy; final hand-gesture offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting abandonment. Subtext in impossible fireflies defying logic; no moralizing, ambiguity lingers in carried rhythm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (drowned constellations, shadowseam wonder); rhythmic prose modulates from drift to shimmer under awe pressure. Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at CR closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "gloved fingers brushing algae-slick corridors as if reading braille maps"); varied rhythm flows read-aloud, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in figurative density (e.g., "beauty stitched into fracture") but pattern-consistent, legible at peak firefly glow without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrology in abyssal ruins with feather as tuning fork, underwater fireflies mirroring reactor—transforms mystic tropes via specific emotional ley lines. Risky lyric texture heightens belonging stakes; inevitable hindsight in dawn ascent carrying wonder.</comment>
