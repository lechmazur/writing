<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shines in "listened—to the sigh between notes," embodying reverence and contradiction between sadness and reclamation; micro-choices like shifting key compel higher stakes, earning the closure's endurance with felt emotional cost. Flawless single-POV traits via tactile tools and preparations anchor motivation without backstory excess.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density builds from brittle tune to shimmering canopy and chorus emergence, landing Charged Poise closure in vine's wreath with conceptual cost of surrender over force. Orientation anchors immediately ("verdant arbor at dawn"); single scene causality intact, no slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Arbor's hum and vine constrain Elara's song-tending, charging final wreath image; sensory bias (moss-oil paradox, pulsing tendril) filters through her tinkerer lens, evolving with hush to mirror reclamation. Micro-setting as tool pressures pivotal melody shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore via alignment) signaled early, tightens via vine's question-curl and oak-voice reversal under Accumulative lens, forcing key-shift agency; cost legible in "solidarity" grip and sad verse, reweighting to crescendo with undeniable price of forgetting confronted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reverence-through-song emerges organically via particulars like reed-pipe flute and chiming blossoms, culminating in non-literal wreath answer to "Why did we stop singing?" without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "people soon to follow," reweighting progress vs. rhythm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("shadows deepened, though sun climbed") biases toward musical hush, stable third-limited distance modulates with intensity; child's "moss-soft" voice carries subtext of collective memory, distinct from Elara's flute-song pursuit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("brittle at first, stumbling over silences" to crescendo); figurative layering purposeful and coherent (amber spirals, velvet hush) without muddle, zero loops—closure image crisp and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer-melody remedy transforms sacred-restoration trope via gear-flute and singing arbor; risk in lyric hush-build pays off in chorus doorway, inevitable hindsight reconfiguration heightens stakes organically.</comment>
