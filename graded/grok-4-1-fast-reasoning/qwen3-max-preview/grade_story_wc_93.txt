<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Herder's interior contradiction—curse as theft of awe yet tool for sync—acts in scene via guided placements; final laugh and pattern-vision earned by prior struggle, with cost in soundless expression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of placements/eels builds to CR in "curse didn’t show him the next second—it showed him the next pattern," with legible cost in transformed precognition and promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frictionless world constrains choices (no grip/speech, hum/exhale instead) and charges final image of humming rocks/tide; aurora pools mercury-like, mirroring summons.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (align with patterns) deepens via eel contact/memories under accumulative lens, forcing exhale agency; cost unmistakable in foreclosed control path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of harnessing via sequence emerges organically; final "method to ask better questions" reweights premise non-literally, charged by mandala-weaving eels.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pattern-noticing ("sacred patterns he’d spent decades failing to grasp"); rhythmic control modulates from shadow-movement to resonant hum/quiet curse-shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figuratives ("living mandala," "collapsed star dust") taught via sequences, no loops; propulsion peaks in touchless contact flooding memories.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frictionless physics, precog curse, sacred math summons eel-ghosts; risk of lyric density heightens closure resonance without gimmick.</comment>
