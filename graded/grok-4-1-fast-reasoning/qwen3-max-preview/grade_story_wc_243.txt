<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in embodied restraint—"She did not weep. Tears would blur the ink"—revealing contradictory impulses of sorrow and preservation; motivation compels writing under self-imposed pressure, earning endurance with minor told epiphanies elsewhere.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably, building density from locket to written clauses; Charged Poise closure in "stitch by ink-stained stitch" reconfigures covenant with felt endurance cost against erasure, orientation anchored immediately at jetty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory selectivity reflects POV urgency—salt-crusted planks under fingers, ink's forest smell, jasmine perfume—constraining gentle work and charging final blooming jetty image as regenerated covenant mirror.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preservation signaled early escalates accumulatively through deepening clauses amid listed ruptures; agency in renunciation (no tears, ongoing witness) forecloses mourning path with legible emotional cost, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of regeneration emerges organically from particulars like locket smile and child laugh; final image offers non-literal answer to covenant rupture via "breath by breath," reweighting small moments with undeniable persistence cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—"ink smelled of forests and endings"—and rhythmic modulation (short declarative peaks like "She smiled—small, private") sustain single POV stability, modulating beautifully with reflective intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative layering (tea steam, stone bridge) propels via varied rhythm; minor overwriting density in writing beat ("steeped... like tea leaves") slightly blurs without touching closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh walnut-ink archivist synthesizes memory preservation innovatively, transforming covenant trope through proximate causes and lyric acts; risk in poetic compression heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
