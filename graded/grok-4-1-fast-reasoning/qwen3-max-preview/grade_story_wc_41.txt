<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (foresight dissolves into forgetting) act through ritual micro-choices like arranging driftwood; final endurance (walks backward despite knowing he'll forget) earned by curse's prior costs, shown in chalk-dust fingerprints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from driftwood arrangement to chalk screeches culminating in sound reveal; Charged Poise closure ("He dropped the chalk... wouldn’t remember") reconfigures options with legible cost of vanishing moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fog and driftwood constrain choices (triangulate grief's echo) and charge final image ("fog reshaped itself into... rocking chair. Then... nothing"); sensory hierarchy (sonic shrieks amid hush) reflects POV's hunt, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate aging's sound) signaled early, escalates via ritual density to climax hearing; agency in chalk drags forecloses forgetting's path with on-page cost ("wouldn’t remember this moment tomorrow"), coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of echoes slipping away emerges organically from rituals and sounds; final image ("chalk... humming faintly—the last echo") offers resonant CR reweighting curse without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sonic ghosts in silence, ozone/static taste) biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates intensity, stable single POV with lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density (each line advances texture/stakes), varied rhythm passes read-aloud test; purposeful metaphors (fog sculpting phantoms) cohere without muddle, no loops in peak screech beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic hunting curse in junkyard echoes; risk-taking in tidal lyricism heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via chalk/driftwood pattern transforming loss trope.</comment>
