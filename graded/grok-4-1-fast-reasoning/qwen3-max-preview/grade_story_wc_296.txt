<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory fear and resolve act simultaneously as seed anchors, compelling higher-stakes micro-choice to kneel and press palm; final heart-unlocking renunciation earned by layered revelations with embodied cost in cracking ribs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of revelations builds to RR closure in vortex collapse and light caught; cost legible in "ribs crack—not with pain, but release" reconfiguring her guarded state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cursed lake's ice faces and inverted branches constrain walk to vortex eye and charge final blooming upward; sensory narrowing to whispers/petals mirrors internal unbending without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth-revelation signaled early tightens via expanding circles peeling armor, forcing endurance trade-off; agency in planting seed drives deepening under accumulative lens with rib-crack cost charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Mirrors lie" realization reweights visions of child/lover/enemy as non-literal answer to guardedness theme, emerging organically from seed's peeling without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature biases toward thorn-vines/moss-marrow metaphors stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from howling wind to serene hymns without filter excess or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines like "roots unfurled beneath her flesh, mapping veins, tracing scars"; figurative density purposeful in circles motif but strains slightly in climax shard-petals without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed-unbending in orchard-vortex transforms druid trope via circles method; risk in lyric fantasy heights stakes, inevitable in "seed now a crown" hindsight.</comment>
