<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction peaks in "data refused to fit" yet "pulse slowed," earning final renunciation of isolation with conceptual cost; interiority particular via scents and spectrometer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build to CR closure in "She realized then: the chemistry... in the convergence," reweighting premise with unquantifiable yield cost; orientation anchored early, no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower chamber and amber constrain waiting/realization and charge final image of "wings catching the last grey light"; sensory hierarchy reflects scientific bias perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (test homecoming chemistry) deepens when "spectrometer registered no anomalous compounds" forces intuitive shift, narrowing to endurance with "quieter now" cost legible on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of amber as "fossilized moment... time... softened" offers resonant non-literal answer to emergent truth, reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "lichen spelled out equations only the wind could solve" and rhythmic modulation under pressure maintain clean single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with image-driven propulsion; minor figurative density in ascent ("bronze quiet sentinel") coherent and pattern-taught, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific pilgrimage yields inevitable "becomes part of the reaction" CR; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
