<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied awe and contradictory impulses (scanning threats yet surprised by beauty); final realization earned via visions tied to prior micro-choices like prying the seam. Perpetually surprised trait constrains perception without labels. Minor therapy-adjacent epiphany phrasing at close doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from search to harmonic visions, culminating in CR/RR closure ("The belonging wasn’t a signal...") with legible cost in shed self-fragments. Orientation anchored early (pilot in observatory at dusk). Single scene seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory hierarchy (thermal scans to bone-resonance hum) filters through pilot's bias; setting constrains (seam pry, drone projection) and charges final blurred stars image. "Brilliant dimness" motif purposeful, not overt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode belonging) signaled early, tightens via chip activation to internal visions; agency in alignment choice forecloses external-search path with felt cost (lost memories). Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, though pilgrim's late appearance slightly softens pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of internal resonance emerges organically from particulars (visions as self-fragments); final image non-literally answers via charged poise ("simply present"), reweighting search motif without moralizing. Pilgrim dialogue confirms subtext subtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (micron-deviations to heartbeat sync); rhythmic modulation heightens visions beat. Sparse dialogue natural, subtextual ("It was never out there").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm; metaphors coherent ("glyphs shimmered like trapped constellations") propel without muddle. Minor overwriting in opening descriptions ("shadows breathe and stone remembers"), but no loops or closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone-tech mysticism transforms relic trope via self-tuning chip; bold lyric risk ( Accumulative visions) inevitable in hindsight, heightening internal stakes without gimmick.</comment>
