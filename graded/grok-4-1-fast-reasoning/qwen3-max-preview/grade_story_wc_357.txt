<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to trace resilience intensifies through micro-choices like banking to the glint and jamming the arrow, earning her shift from fixing to echoing; interiority concrete via embodied senses (breath caught, bones vibrated). Contradictory impulses subtle in risking deeper flight as gravity snaps back. Final weeping recognition forecloses prior path with felt emotional cost. Single-POV strengths shine without relational needs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dew-trails build to arrow discovery, touch deepens resonance knowledge, tree action reconfigures orchard into song. Orientation anchored early (orchard planet, inversion hour). CR closure via fused arrow and purpose shift, cost legible in "waiting for someone who... flew when the world turned upside down." One tightening sufficient for scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Floating arches and inverted runoff constrain landing/sprint; dew spirals as liquid compass charge navigation to glint. Sensory hierarchy (scent of nectar, thrumming relic) reflects pilot bias. World rules (gravity flip, bio-resonance) learned via action. Final image recharges setting via harmonized echoes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resilience source) signaled early, tightens via arrow's vine reaction narrowing to Grandmother act amid reverting gravity. Protagonist agency drives: touch despite unknown, deeper flight foreclosing escape. Cost visible in timed sprint/launch. Accumulative pressure coheres to stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of resilience-as-remembering emerges from arrow's storage of trauma/triumph, orchard's echoes; final song/CR reweights premise without statement. Returning spirals (dew, vines, moss rings) shift meaning organically. Ambiguity lingers in her echoed purpose, no tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in third-limited, perceptual signature via "whirling silence," "liquid compass needles." Rhythm modulates: short sprints in inversion climax, breathing cadence post-song. No head-hopping or withholding; elisions purposeful/legible. Prose texture fits pilot's intuitive mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels: multi-job lines integrate sense/action (vines "snaking up her calves, blooming instant orchids"). Figurative density purposeful/lyric-taught, coherent spirals avoid muddle. Minor metaphor stack in opening but no loops or scaffold; rhythm varies, closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: arrow-as-seed catalyst for echo-resilience on inverting orchard planet feels inevitable from dew navigation. Bold lyric sci-fi transforms tropes (lost artifact plants memory). Risky inversion mechanics heighten stakes coherently; no hedging.</comment>
