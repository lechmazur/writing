<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, like tasting lagoon water despite risk, reveal interior contradiction between curiosity and potential entrapment; sensibly eccentric trait enables delve but lacks deeper flaw-complicated tradeoffs touching closure. Final homecoming renunciation earned via prior psychometry causality. No unearned epiphanies, but internal conflict skews descriptive over simultaneous impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from descent to psychometry revelation ("hinged awakenings") to journal, culminating in Conceptual Repricing closure where Elira chooses inward guidance with legible cost (sealed passage, forfeited surface life). Orientation anchored early (fence, fissure, lagoon). One tightening via compass reading narrows to surrender without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Subterranean lagoon's mineral dampness, dripping stalactites, and petrichor constrain ritual choices and charge final image (warm passage air); sensory hierarchy (scent/silence over sight) reflects POV bias. Details evolve causally (water for psychometry/journal). Micro-setting (compass on shale) mirrors internal shift, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find explanations' failure) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via psychometry deepening knowledge of surrender; agency in tasting water and tucking journal forecloses return with felt cost (belonging to stone). Pressure coheres to Charged Poise at passage step. One reversal (terror to awe via compass) tightens options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of sensory truth over reason emerges organically from petrichor psychometry and journal ("follow the scent"); final image (stone sealing as "closing eyelid") offers resonant CR repricing surface logic without moralizing. Subtext in silence's vibration charges ambiguity of chosen entrapment. Particulars like inverted constellations avoid platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature (scent/silence bias: "musk of ancient roots"); voice texture modulates rhythmically from steady descent to hushed laugh. Compression purposeful in cavern's "resonant hush vibrating in her molars." No head-hopping; diction fits sensibly eccentric lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "rope biting into her palms, breath shallow, heart steady" advances setting/action/emotion); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("logic dissolves like sugar in rain") during peak psychometry slightly muddles but pattern-taught. Closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Petrichor collector premise synthesizes psychometry, scent-truth, and expedition lore into fresh inward-guidance turn; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Compass reprise transforms trope of lost explorers. Hindsight inevitability in "stone breathes here" callback.</comment>
