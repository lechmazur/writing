<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular via humming conjectures and thumb-tracing equations; final change to reawakening earned by scarf's activation and singing, with felt search cost. Sanely eccentric traits constrain shelving and enable entry without labels dominating. No major flaws touch closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from library slip-in to amphitheater singing, culminating in CR via librarian's realization and patrons' warmed pages. Orientation anchored early (shadow in scientific poetry library). Closure cost legible in "seven years searching" reweighted by satisfaction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Hyperbolic tessellations and pulsing orbs constrain entry and charge final desk image; sensory hierarchy (chalk-dust, rustle) reflects POV priorities. Details evolve causally (shelves groan, air thickens). Body/scarf as micro-setting enables micro-choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find story-place) signaled early, tightens via scarf-drape and step-in under Accumulative lens; agency in axiom-whisper and singing forecloses search path. Cost felt in analog persistence amid digital collapse, visible in return humming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of analog sanctuary emerges via particulars (scarf survives Collapse, orbs breathe); final image (warmer pages) offers non-literal answer reweighting digital loss without moralizing. Resonance from hyperbolic "infinite stories without crowding."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (equations as sonnets); rhythmic prose modulates from shadow-silence to manifold-song under pressure. No elision or head-hopping; diction biased to scientific-poetic lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "The silk rippled... The air thickened"); no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors in peak (tessellation entry). Rhythms vary for ear; minor long-sentence runs purposeful in lyric build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry as story-locus transforms tropes; risk in folding world and orbs heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from scarf-hem hint to reawakening.</comment>
