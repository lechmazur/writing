<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strength in embodied contradiction at "weep, not from grief, but from snowmelt ardor," rooting past forgiveness in present micro-choices like tugging the braid to release Elara's giggle; final renunciation of signature feels earned via prior unraveling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure at blowing the helix—chorus roots with cost of slack rope and empty hands; orientation anchors immediately in first lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum and aurora constrain waiting ("wrapped in furs") and charge final image of helix in bedrock cradled by oaks; selective sensory hierarchy (hum of fibers, drip of snowmelt) mirrors thawing process.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preservation escalates accumulatively through reconfiguring rope (giggle release narrows to bronze pour) to helix blow, forcing trade-off of unraveling ancient vow; cost legible in "rope, now half-unraveled."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of vibration-preservation emerges from particulars like punched holes whispering names, resonant non-literal close in helix carrying lullabies forward without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in caster's bias ("threading melody into mantra," "technically gentle hands"); rhythmic modulation peaks at "A note blooms—warm, amber, trembling," stable first-person POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short "Cooling takes three days" breathes amid lush process); figurative consistency (rope as python, helix pocked) taught early without muddle at climax pour.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost-wax process, organ card, and chant-rope into memory-helix transforms preservation trope; risk of lyric ritual heightens stakes in unsigned legacy.</comment>
