<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's arboreal motivation roots every micro-choice, from patient deconstruction to whispering "Show me," earning her shift to cartographer with embodied resonance like breath caught at the chime. Contradictory impulses surface in pausing amid thunder, revealing hierarchy of listening over forcing. Final renunciation of "fixing" feels inevitable via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from sextant glow to dream-projection to forest offering, culminating in CR closure where mapping reconfigures sorrow-measuring premise with resonant cost in her smile amid whispering trees. Orientation anchors in first paragraph; one tightening at healing click narrows to following dreams. No lens ambiguity; cost legible in "She wasn’t fixing anything anymore."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moonlight as micro-setting constrains healing and charges final pooling image around her sketching; storm-rain-tower-forest evolves tactilely, mirroring internal grief absorption without overt symbolism. Sensory hierarchy (silver glow, rustles) reflects worker's priorities; spatial choreography clear from stairs to mossy root.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (arboreal discovery) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via dream-mapping that reweights quantified sorrow, forcing stance from technician to pilgrim; agency in "Show me" forecloses prior path. Escalation coheres with one decisive projection reversal; cost felt in resonance of trees' offerings, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trees-as-silent-witnesses emerges organically from particulars like oak's crevice offerings, culminating in non-literal final sketch that reweights sorrow from overload to mapped mercy without moralizing. Subtext layers in images like leaves trembling at unnamed grief; ambiguity lingers in mundane miracles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct with perceptual signature (sorrow etched in fractures, roots remembering screams); single POV stable, modulating rhythm from thick dust to exhaling mist. Compression taught early pays off in charged poise of final whispers; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "Each screw... came loose like a sigh"; metaphors cohere (moonlight pooled like blessing) without muddle in peak projection beat. Rhythms vary read-aloud, zero loops or scaffolds; propulsion peaks at "the nearest oak split its bark."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sextant-as-sorrow-gauge transforms trope into arboreal cartography, with risk-taking in dream-projection yielding inevitable hindsight freshness; no derivative echoes, bold synthesis of quantified grief and tree-witnessing heightens stakes to merciful mapping.</comment>
