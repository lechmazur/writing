<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in tracing smudge vs. pinning illustration act simultaneously, earning final endurance of truth's weight; embodied in "snowflakes stung her cheeks, sharp as regret," revealing values hierarchy with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density (smudge, aurora, oracle responses) tightening to Charged Poise closure; "softening of her shoulders, the first true inhale" logs legible cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gantrys ice-glazed metal and stinging snow constrain release choice, charging pinned orchid image; aurora's "mourning light" evolves purposefully with emotional arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Query-deepening escalates internal stake of swallowed truth, driven by agency in gantry step per oracle's "rupture"; shivering return makes endurance cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final "carry error as part of function" reconfigures swaying certainties premise non-literally, resonating via smudged orchid without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "wind gnashed against the reinforced glass" biases toward alpine grief; oracle dialogue subtextually advances via poetic replies, stable limited POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Let the smudge become the center" delivers propulsion and density without loops; rhythm varies naturally, metaphors cohere in peak gantry beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fault-tolerant oracle-oracle queries synthesize tech endurance with human silence uniquely; pinning fiction-to-truth transforms isolation trope organically.</comment>
