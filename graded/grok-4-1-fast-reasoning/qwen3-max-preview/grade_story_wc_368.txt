<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority particular and embodied in "pulse had become a stranger’s rhythm, thrumming with borrowed time"; contradictory drive to understand rather than heal earns final shift to cultivating fractures with visible vulnerability cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations build density to Conceptual Repricing closure; fabric's responsive flicker reconfigures premise of magnetism with cost of unexplained illumination legible in "She didn’t explain."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Floating tea house tethered "by ancient silk ropes to nothing but belief" anchors selectively via POV's light-tracking bias, constraining observation and charging final mist-curl image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to grasp story-magnetism tightens accumulatively via wing insights to old man's refraction and self-application; cost felt in aperture of fractures foreclosing replication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of authentic fractures magnetizing stories emerges implicitly via wing-heart-old man triad; final fabric "flickering between visibility and vanishing" resonantly reweights premise without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature on light angles ("glory preferred the side glance") stable in third-limited POV; rhythmic control modulates revelation without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative pattern (iridescence/light) taught early pays off sans muddle or loops; propulsion peaks in "patience detonates" without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of donor heart, stolen wing, and story-magnetism via iridescent lattices transforms introspection into bold lyric risk; "broken places gleam" inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
