<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scattered memory keeper's contradictory impulses—humming a "ghost" melody that "stumbles" and invites rather than forces—embody her fractured mind and compel the communal joining; final shift to "the loom" earned with her weeping as recognition, a visible cost scaled perfectly to lyric scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: her solo hum accumulates voices into density surge ("child’s voice... then an elder... baker"), tightening to mica "cracked—not with destruction, but release" as Resonant Reconfiguration; cost legible in "realm remembering itself," reweighting scattered fragments into whole without demand.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mica windows and moss constrain ascent and humming choice, charging final orchard "breathing deeper" image; sensory bias (bare feet on "dew-kissed moss," palms on "cool and whispering" mica) filters through keeper's memory-curating priorities, evolving causally from hoard to release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle via resonance) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as voices braid into "trembled" climax narrowing apathy-to-harmony options; her invitational agency forecloses force path with embodied cost in "didn’t force it," though realm-scale abstracts slightly from micro-beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of reminding over fixing emerges organically from song-threads "knitting" unraveled dawns, culminating in non-literal "swaddle a people... dawns are whole again" image reweighting silence's conceptual cost; minor final-paragraph articulation borders telling but ties earned particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature biased to memory-fragments ("pockets stuffed with... scent of rain"); rhythmic diction modulates from wandering hush to choral surge, with purposeful compression ("let the tune wander, let it stumble") paying off in communal release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density integrates image/action ("mica shivered... fleck of gold swirled") with propulsion; varied rhythm breathes with invitation's pace, zero loops/artifacts, metaphors coherent (light "hoarded... like fireflies pinned") enhancing peak without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical memory orchard and mica-hoarded dawns transforms communal-song trope via "invitation" over force, risking lyric density that inevitably charges "bound... harmony" reconfiguration; bold mirror-world frame commits fully without retreat.</comment>
