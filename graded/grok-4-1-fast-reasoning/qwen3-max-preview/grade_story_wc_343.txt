<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength in embodied curiosity via tracing hopscotch and cross-referencing, compelling higher-stakes approach to captain; minor weakness in low internal contradiction during presentation, lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from hopscotch notice to luminance mastery; closure as Charged Poise in chalk-charting reconfigures isolation into fluency with felt ongoing cost of dog-eared commitment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Airship deck and balloon constrain hopping sequence and charge final chalk image; starling murmurations as micro-setting evolve with luminance, mirroring internal discovery without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of charting via patterns tightens at hopscotch decoding, narrowing to crew-wide beacon with agency in directing hops; cost legible in shifted murmurations and new shared responsibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden world languages emerges organically from phrasebook, hopscotch, birds; final whispering-back image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting blank spaces without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature of obsessive pattern-noting; voice texture modulates from anxious flipping to confident directing, dialogue natural and goal-driven in captain scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, purposeful metaphors like "lute strung with sunbeams"; minor figurative density in opening eases into propulsion, no loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hopscotch-as-luminance-map synthesizes airship fantasy freshly, transforming isolation trope via pattern fluency; risk in chalk-navigation payoff feels inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
