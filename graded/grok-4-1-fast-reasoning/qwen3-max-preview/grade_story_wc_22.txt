<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in restoration shines through ritual actions like planting at specific death sites, earning a credible endurance with felt persistence; interiority particular via cracked hands and throat-listening, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene for 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from listening to bird-permitted planting to final Charged Poise; closure reconfiguration legible in "tight, trembling space between what was lost and what might yet grow," with conceptual cost of fractured insistence undeniable on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Jetty planks and slats constrain planting (scooping soil between), charging final shadow image; sensory selection (silt-soft syllables, kelp scent) purposeful and POV-biased toward ritual sites, evolving with tide.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of achieving submerged concord signaled early, tightens texturally via bird signals narrowing to action; agency in micro-choices like crushing pods forces trade-off of silence-breaking, with cost felt in ritual's slow seep, charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of life reweaving scars emerges organically from seed burials at death sites to final sprouts-over-bayonets image, reweighting memory/mercy without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in "petals press against rusted bayonets."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in ancient-tongue whispers and bird-verb interpretations; rhythmic texture modulates from dusk sighs to softened lullabies, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "pods... curled like ancient scrolls, brittle as forgotten vows" advances object/voice/motif); figurative density voice-motivated in lyric mode without muddle, rhythm varies naturally, no loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed-cipher ritual, dead tongues, bird pacts transforms battlefield reclamation into inevitable textual poise; risk in non-causal bird "conversation" heightens stakes organically, no derivative echoes.</comment>
