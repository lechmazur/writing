<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via synesthetic embodiment peaks cleanly in the laugh's "cerulean with flecks of brass, smelled of wet pavement and cinnamon," earning the thinning/release with contradictory refusal-pull; minor abstraction in backstory traits avoids full 9+ specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density buildup to coin spin/singing ("seven notes, woven from the sighs"), delivering Charged Poise closure in sapling sprout and ghost's thinning with legible cost of self-dissolution; orientation anchors in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orchard/fountain constrain choices (coin spun above fountain, branches crack fissures) and charge final sapling image; sensory hierarchy (dewdrops reflect futures, roses exhale melodies) filters through ghost's priorities without catalog excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lure possibility) signaled early tightens accumulatively in echoes' emergence and singing's braiding, forcing release trade-off; cost felt in "form thinned... release she’d avoided," but lacks one agency-driven micro-reversal for 9-band under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of art/memory luring possibility emerges organically from particulars, final sapling ("Grow") reconfiguring despair-to-courage without moralizing; resonant counter-reading in ghost's oblique cost lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct synesthetic perceptual signature ("voice turned grief into lilac mist") and rhythmic modulation under climax pressure sustain close-3rd stability; purposeful elision of backstory pays off in present sensing/choice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines, but minor overwrite in climax metaphors ("braiding despair into something softer, stranger") risks coherence without pattern harm to closure; no loops, clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synesthetic ghost weaving echoes/timelines transforms haunted theater trope into fresh orchard release; tarot coin's hover/chime inflects inevitability, risking bold lyricism that heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
