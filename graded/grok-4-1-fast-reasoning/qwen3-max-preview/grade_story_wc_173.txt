<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Solid interiority and motivation rooted in resonance and defiance, shown through patient untangling and embodied heat melting snow; micro-choices like synchronizing breath reveal values. Lacks deeper blind spots or mistakes compounding pressure, making her too serenely competent without genuine struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via progressive thread releases culminating in RR closure at "The knot dissolved... prism flared," reconfiguring silence into textured voice with cost in her solitary homecoming and emptied prism. Orientation anchored early in courtyard/prism; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration—snowflakes melting from intent, prism's humming facets—mirrors internal resolve and constrains climax via threads' tactile demand. Final bare feet leaving no prints charges closure image, qualifying 9+ constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest echoes to defy conformity) signaled early, escalates texturally through yielding threads narrowing to final resistant knot, forcing whisper-agency; cost legible in furnace-intent and non-print feet foreclosing conformity path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of defiant remembrance emerges organically from unraveling lives' murmurs into spilling harvest; final "courtyard, now alive with murmurs" offers resonant reconfiguration of lullaby without moralizing, reweighting silence as rebellion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical perceptual signature—body as verse, sighs as script—modulates rhythmically; stable third-limited POV with clean distance, purposeful poetic compression taught early and legible at echo-spill closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety and density propel, but dense figurative strings ("coiled like sleeping serpents," "furnace of refusal") in untangling beat border overwriting without muddle, docking from peak clarity; no loops, strong propulsion overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courtesan-poet harvesting sonic echoes via threads transforms tropes into inevitable lyric defiance; bold risky poetic fantasy commits fully, with prism-flare reweighting feeling earned and irreplaceable.</comment>
