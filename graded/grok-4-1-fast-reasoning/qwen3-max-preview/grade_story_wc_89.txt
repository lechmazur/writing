<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and embodied in "bone learning feather, blood learning flame," revealing contradictory surrender amid transformation; motivation intensifies via spices and memory, compelling the climactic yielding with visible self-cost. Final metamorphosis earned by prior micro-choices like whispering to remember. No stock phrasing or unearned shifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds from spices' aromas to spark's bloom, delivering Charged Poise closure in the phoenix's return and reforged bond, with cost legible in "grief learning song." Orientation anchored in opening lines; single scene coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orchard and moonlight constrain ritual via responding branches, pulsing moon syncing heartbeat, and falling petals as slow snow; spices' scents integrate tactilely, mirroring internal shift in "air shimmered... with longing." Recurrent elements charge final exhale without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforge bond) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through scent-coiling and skin-translation, narrowing to surrender-choice with agency in non-resistance; cost felt in bodily metamorphosis foreclosing prior self at spark's bloom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love outlasting entropy emerges organically from fortune-invitation, spice-keys, and hybrid phoenix; final "Everywhere" image reconfigures loss into covenant without moralizing, resonant via particulars like glowing footprints.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature in sensory bias (scents bending gravity); lyrical rhythm modulates from quiet certainty to heat's cradle, consistent under pressure. Brief dialogue natural, subtextual in "I never left," advancing bond.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative overload in transformation beat ("smoke serpents... lift," "ember-feathers") risks coherence without pattern payoff, docking peak propulsion; minor "not X, but Y" loops purposeful yet templated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune cookie in fairy-tale via persistent paper-invitation and sideways-time spices transforms phoenix trope; risk-taking in hybrid creature and cosmic leaning heightens stakes organically to closure.</comment>
