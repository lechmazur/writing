<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concrete interiority and embodied emotion shine in micro-choices like pressing the crystal to mirrors, revealing contradictory impulses between armored duty and vulnerable girlhood; final self-confrontation in the oval mirror earns the renunciation of wholeness with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as glimpses accumulate density toward Charged Poise closure in the shimmering mirror and whispered question, with legible cost in accepting "not whole... but enough"; orientation anchors immediately in lighthouse orchard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices via intuitive guidance by ice creaks and wind, lighthouse beam, and mirrors hung in trees; skeletal orchard and shifting floes charge final image where ice groans "with possibility," mirroring internal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconstituting courage tightens texturally through accumulating anomalies to self-mirror climax, narrowing options from shattered past to deliberate mercy; cost legible in "slow work" and broken persistence charging the final paths revealed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of peace as "presence of choice" emerges organically from glimpses of anomalies, reweighted non-literally by ending question "What if we choose differently?" that resonates prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in selective noticing of suspended glimpses and intuitive pauses; rhythmic control modulates from calm accumulation to charged poise, with stable close-third POV and purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm—no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; peak clarity in closure lines like "The fragment pulsed" integrates image, sound, and resolve without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-war empathy-mapping via scavenged mirrors transforms peacekeeper trope into lyrical ingenuity; risk in quiet, image-driven closure heightens stakes through intuitive anomaly-hunting.</comment>
