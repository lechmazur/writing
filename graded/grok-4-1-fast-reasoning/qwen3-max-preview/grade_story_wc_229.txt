<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied motivation shines in "blistered fingers" and "intention, raw and trembling," compelling the core choice with consistent traits; interior contradiction via shallow breath under vow's weight earns subtle endurance at closure. Minor slip in overt epiphany phrasing like "whispers traveled farther" avoids deeper deduction as it's vow-anchored early.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent density builds to ships' turn ("The ship turned, smooth as a sigh"), delivering Charged Poise closure with felt cost in "sank to her knees"; orientation anchored by para 1, single scene coherent, one tightening via vibration surge suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse constrains broadcast ("curling down the lighthouse walls"), charging final image; sensory hierarchy (scent over sight) reflects POV urgency, details like "peeling under salt" mirror internal gentleness post-heat. Micro-setting (cork, railing) evolves tactilely without stalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purify sea's intent) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via scent spread to on-page reversal ("three more vessels corrected course"); agency in pressing cork forecloses shouting path with embodied cost ("relief, thick as honey").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unshouted tenderness emerges organically via cork/scent particulars, resonating in final "sea sighing" image without moral; subtext in ships' quiet shift reweights premise. Slight on-nose "screaming tenderness" tempers peak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (vibrations as "tuning fork struck against bone") stable in single POV; rhythm modulates pressure (short sentences in surge), purposeful compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "Dawn bled gold... staining the cobalt tower"); rhythmic variety passes ear test, minor metaphor density ("liquid gold") in closure avoids overwrite penalty as pattern-consistent. No loops or scaffolds dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of intent-purifying cork transforms lighthouse trope via scent/vibration logic; risk in lyric fantasy heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early vow to whispering wind response.</comment>
