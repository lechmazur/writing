<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elira's contradictory impulses—reckless idealism via tender acts amid Kael's threat—act in scene, earning Kael's loosening grip as seedling change with relational cost. Internal conflict embodied in "fiercely gentle" response to lunge. Voice distinction clear in dialogue idioms. Minor telling in backstory block fits BRR.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from Elira's ritual to orchard's surge and cards surfacing, yielding Charged Poise closure in "roots began to weave them together" with felt barter cost. Orientation anchored early in catacomb orchard. Single scene, one tightening via Kael's lunge. Cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains via roots twining Kael's ankles and surfacing cards, charging closure. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased: barefoot soles on bone/earth, glow-filtered fissures. Details integrated into action, evolving causally. Micro-setting (oak, resin) mirrors internal states without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weaving lullabies vs carving epitaphs) signaled early, tightens via lunge/restraint to Charged Poise with agency in Elira's anchor-touch foreclosing pure opposition. Cost unmistakable in Kael's loosening grip and woven destinies. Accumulative pressure coheres under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of patching souls emerges from particulars (tarot inlay, roots' agreement), final image reconfigures "vengeance" and "grace" without moral. Subtext in dialogue silences and wrist-touch. Resonance from flawed characters' complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in biased noticing (roots as "living manacles," resin "slow tears"). Dialogue natural/subtextual, advances conflict (trammel flips). Stable third-close POV, rhythmic modulation under stress. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density, propulsion via varied rhythm; metaphors coherent ("moon cracked by time") without muddle in peak lunge. Minor figurative density in climax (−0.3) but pattern-taught/pays off. No loops; clean grammar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb orchard/tarot inlay transforms tropes; risk in lyrical fantasy heightens stakes. Final weaving inevitable from particulars. Bold voice commits to premise without retreat.</comment>
