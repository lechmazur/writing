<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses in wilting under ambient lies yet pressing on reveal hierarchy of values; final endurance as archive earned by escalating discoveries with embodied cost in paling skin and thinning breath.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as glyph discoveries deepen density to CR closure: "the lost conversations hadn’t vanished... waiting for witness," reconfiguring quest with felt reversal cost on page; orientation anchored early, no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse details constrain via humming vents and propaganda-induced wilting while charging final image of "emerald haze"; recurring vines/moss filter through calligraphic POV, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens accumulatively through wilting escalation—"pressed a damp cloth to her forehead"—forcing endurance until chest discovery forecloses isolation path; agency in map-following yields legible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of preserved candor emerges organically from note/letter particulars, culminating in resonant CR: "Now, she would become the archive," reweighting premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature—"ligatures of longing, marginalia of memory"—modulates rhythm under stress; purposeful lyric compression taught early pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops or scaffolds; figurative language selective in peaks like "silence pooled like standing water," enhancing propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligraphic glyphs as emotional cartography in dystopic greenhouse transforms quest trope; risk in wilting curse heightens stakes organically to inevitable CR.</comment>
