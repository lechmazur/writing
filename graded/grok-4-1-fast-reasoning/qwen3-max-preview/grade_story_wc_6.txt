<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction between destruction and salvation embodied in coin ritual and final radio response; micro-choices like threading the cord reveal values with cost. Father's legacy flaw drives inevitable compassion without hedging. Minor epiphanic tell ("She does now") slips but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to Charged Poise closure: coin dip forms figure, threads cord, lagoon hums with conceptual cost of refined wild love. Orientation anchored early (dunes, lagoon). Single scene coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Black sand constrains kneeling/jogging, obsidian shards charge ritual image; sensory hierarchy (salt air, sand grit) POV-filtered via firefighter alertness. Final tattoo recharges lagoon mirror. Environment guides grafting choice purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (legacy redemption) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via coin vibration drawing shapes/figure; agency in whispering "Sing with me" crystallizes stance, foreclosing erasure with felt cost of acceptance. Radio call tests under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scars-as-song emerges organically from particulars (cannery mercy, bakery save, coin graft); final tattoo swirl reweights binaries without moral. Resonance in lagoon hum harmonizing rupture. No tidy assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in fluid fire-water diction (kelp-drift, tide-pulled); rhythm modulates to peak compression at figure's emergence. No elision issues; voice particularizes noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, metaphors consistent (kelp, sand scarring); no loops, scaffold, or muddle despite lyric density—ritual beat flows read-aloud. Minor overwriting in opening dune walk elevated but pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arson-firefighter duality in lagoon graft ritual transforms tropes; coin threading/figure essence risks bold lyric ingenuity, inevitable in hindsight via "scars can sing." No derivatives.</comment>
