<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Artist's defiant mischief evolves into complex devotion, with contradictory impulses (prank vs. scalpel) embodied in trembling fingers and child-session micro-choice, earning final self-refraction that forecloses ritual with spire's dissolution as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density through refracted sessions to dream-tightening and self-act closure; CR lands on-page as spire dissolves into rain-burnt-sugar mist, visibly reweighting purity's lie with defiance's conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Canyon echoes and bone towers constrain hurling choices across sessions; mist's pulse-to-face evolution mirrors internal states, charging spire's thinning dissolution as resonant final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake against spire's coherence hunger deepens accumulatively via child-session dimming to protagonist's self-refraction agency; shuddering spire and defied ritual deliver unmistakable on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Forgiveness-as-complexity emerges implicitly from echo-alterations, with final "I'm sorry" refracted as acknowledgment reweighting the price of truth without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with refraction-biased perception ("mist pulsed like a slow heartbeat") holds stable single-POV, rhythmic control heightening pressure to whispered closure poise; child's brief dialogue natural and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High-density propulsion varies rhythm without loops or muddled figuratives; peak self-recital breathes purposefully, distilling to "mist that smelled of rain and burnt sugar" for clean closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Poetry-refraction in grief-bone world synthesizes defiance ingeniously, transforming coherence tropes via spire-face reveal that risks bold conceptual payoff, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
