<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to preserve hope roots deeply in her vigil and embodied anchor (river stone warming), driving the realization and embedding action with felt cost; interiority concrete via dusk-noticing gaze and weeping for resilience. Minor abstraction in "luminous regret" avoids full 9+ contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from audit flicker to metamorphosis discovery to stone-embedding CR, reweighting hope with undeniable conceptual cost ("Remember the weight. Remember the texture of fear"). Orientation anchored early; closure legible on-page with ripple through dreams.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blooming library with petal-chandeliers and floating shelves constrains choices (projects footage in nook, embeds in archive) and charges final image; sensory details (pulsed spines, dappled gold) filtered through Elira's priorities, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve hope) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via footage comparison tightening to metamorphosis realization, narrowing options to embedding with visible cost (dreams now "richer... threaded with luminous regret"). Agency in patient hunt and final act; one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of adaptive hope emerges organically from shadow's transformation and stone's ripple, offering resonant non-literal answer in final image ("shadows still knew how to tremble… and how to rise") without moralizing; reweights prior footage contrast.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature (thresholds, indigo surrenders); voice modulates poetically yet precisely, syntax/rhythm heightening realizations (e.g., "struck her like dawn through stained glass"). No dialogue; elisions purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion, varied rhythm (e.g., short punchy realizations amid lyric flow); figurative language purposeful and consistent without muddle, though minor overwriting in opening petals risks slight drag before pattern teaches.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-archives overwriting grit with gloss, shadow-as-hope's chrysalis, and stone anchoring; risk-taking in lyric sci-fi frame transforms tropes, with metamorphosis turn inevitable from footage hunt.</comment>
