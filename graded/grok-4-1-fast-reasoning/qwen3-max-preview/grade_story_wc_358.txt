<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Investigator's motivation to map chaos for foresight drives consistent micro-choices like planting sensors despite silence, embodied in touching the patch repeatedly; interiority particular via technical lens on wind vectors. Minor flaw: assured competence lacks deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, but final commitment to confront wind earns credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as observations densify toward CR closure: final step into wind's path reconfigures premise of adaptive chaos with conceptual cost of personal confrontation. Orientation anchored immediately in port labyrinth post-silence; single scene tightens via wind spike at Junction 7 linking crash causality without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Labyrinthine containers channel wind, constraining survey paths and charging final image where protagonist steps into its "path"; sensory hierarchy (crunch, creak, tug) reflects professional bias. Micro-setting of anemometer and vectors integrates purposefully, mirroring internal convergence theory without tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to predict convergence escalates accumulatively via impossible gusts tying to Varga's crash, narrowing options to deeper maze entry; agency in persistent measurement despite silence forces stance crystallization. Cost felt in time pressure before sunset and patch's weight, legible in final challenge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of foresight amid adaptive chaos emerges organically from wind "learning" via containers, reweighted in CR ending where investigator invites mutual scrutiny without moralizing. Varga's transmission "the way the wind learns" seeds subtext, resonating via final image's non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature biases toward physics (vectors, gradients) with rhythmic modulation under rising chill; voice distinct in phrases like "wind curled around a corner, tasting the air." No dialogue; POV stable, compression purposeful for textural drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., "anemometer. Wind spiked—17 knots... dropped to zero" advances action, data, stakes); rhythm varies with short spikes mimicking gusts. Minor metaphor density in opening ("whispering secrets") purposeful, no loops dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of accident investigation with personified wind "learning" in container geometry transforms trope of unnatural disaster; risk in CR ending ("Let it learn me too") heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; premise commits fully to adaptive physics without retreat.</comment>
