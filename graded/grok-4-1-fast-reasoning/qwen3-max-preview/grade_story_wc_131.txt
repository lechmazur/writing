<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Embodied emotions peak in "warmth spreading through her ribs" and tears at notice, earning subtle change from isolation; interiority concrete via sense flares, but mild contradiction limits 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: relic density builds to Charged Poise closure at notice ("you’re not alone"), reconfiguring invisibility with legible tear-cost; orientation anchored early, one tightening via fragment placement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Crawl spaces and stained-glass constrain hiding/placement choices, charging final "light through stained glass"; sensory hierarchy (ozone, thrum) reflects dweller's bias, micro-setting as recurring veins/ducts evolves with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (invisibility vs. resonance) signaled early, tightens via risky placements narrowing to emotional cost in tears; agency in caching drives under lens, but abstract need softens visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of visibility-as-resonance emerges via relic echoes, final notice reweights premise non-literally without moral; counter-reading (hoarding risk) adds complexity from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (ghost-sound pulses) stable in single POV, rhythmic modulation heightens hush-to-warmth; sparse dialogue natural/subtextual in intern's gasp.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated sensory action, no loops/artifacts; figurative consistency ("sapphire hush" to "gold") supports tone without muddle, varied rhythm passes ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hidden dweller returning relics transforms invisibility trope; risk in poetic relic-agency feels inevitable, heightening stakes via sense-memory rule-set.</comment>
