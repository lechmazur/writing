<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority particular through polymer/river analogies; contradictory impulses (blame vs. flow) act in scooping foam and sketching; final redesign renunciation earned by causal insight with embodied cost of tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as foam observation density builds to CR closure (grief reconfigured as flow) with conceptual cost legible in chrysalis swept away; single tightening from past frustration to present sketch suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Braided ravine and foam constrain pilgrimage choices (tracing paths, scooping) and charge final image (streams converge, gilding foam); sensory hierarchy (symphonic sounds over visuals) reflects chemist bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant atonement stake signaled early tightens via foam insight reversal, narrowing options to dissolution acceptance; agency in micro-choices (gloves off, notebook sketch) forecloses permanence with felt impermanence cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of rupture as rhythm emerges organically from particulars (scaffold, foam geometries); final polymer dream reweights separation premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with symphonic rhythm (glissandi, timpani) matches perceptual signature; stable close third-person filters all through chemist's polymer/music lens under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels insight beats; purposeful metaphor pattern (braided DNA, liquid gold) coherent without muddle, even in peak foam epiphany.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer grief via chrysalis/foam/river braid transforms atonement trope; risk in symphonic lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
