<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene via rest attempt versus resumed climb, earning the final reconfiguration of regret into fuel; motivation rooted in textured regret compels escalating proofs. Interiority concrete and particular (marrow-deep certainty, die's click as metronome). Closure choice earned by prior micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from whispers to carved/speaking proofs, culminating in pattern-breaking ripple and RR (Charged Poise) where reflection touch reconfigures regret with cost (die vanishes). One tightening via proof escalation narrows to rupture. Orientation anchored early in staircase/optimist intro; closure cost legible in "He stood taller... weave it into the next proof."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Staircase as micro-setting constrains (carries him when sitting) and charges final ripple image; die/body tactile (clicks, rolls on landings). Sensory selective (echoes, cold tread, liquid glass). Details filter through POV's geometric bias, mirroring internal paradox without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture texture) signaled early, escalates via proof density under Accumulative lens to agency-driven tightening (elegant proof causes ripple). Cost unmistakable in die's vanishing and reconfiguration. No live option foreclosed earlier, but final trade-off charges image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of weaving regret into endurance emerges organically from dice motif and proofs rupturing stasis; final image ("weave it into the next proof") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting perpetual indecision. Complexity lingers in grim optimism without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mathematical/geometric diction ("theorem tested against gravity’s silent dissent"); rhythmic control modulates from steady climb to peak intensity at ripple. Stable single POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "chipped die clicked... metronome of regret"); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test. Minor figurative density in proofs beat but pattern-taught and propels to closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical proofs rupturing infinite staircase/prepetual motion trope, transformed via dice regret; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes. Final reconfiguration inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
