<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density build to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "The market will call her ruined" after smashing vials, with petal constraint shaping the image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Grotto constrains and charges closure via resonance—"The grotto’s amber pulses faintly, resonating with the petal’s charge"—evolving to "hums in approval" and "shimmering like captured sunset."</comment>
