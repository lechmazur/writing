<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concrete interiority in honoring breakage drives micro-choices like hymning mundane sounds; minor epiphanic summary ("She understood then") slightly undercuts fully earned change without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as hymn density builds to shard's dissolution (Charged Poise RR) with legible cost in sanctified imperfection; orientation anchored early in haven post-blood work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vinyl shard as micro-setting constrains offering and charges closure glow/dissolution; scent of hope evolves purposefully across senses to mirror unification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reunification escalates accumulatively via soul responses (woman weeping, child giggling), deepening with shard mending to foreclose disconnection path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brokenness-to-connection theme emerges organically from vinyl hymns; final souls-touching image offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting mundane sacredness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature in sound/scent bias; rhythmic modulation heightens hymn beats without elision or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density propels via varied sensory rhythm; minor repetitive "scent of hope" churn (4 instances) dulls without full pattern payoff, but no closure touch.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hospice mundanities transformed into afterlife vinyl hymns synthesize fresh ingenuity; risky lyric ascent feels inevitable from opening blood work.</comment>
