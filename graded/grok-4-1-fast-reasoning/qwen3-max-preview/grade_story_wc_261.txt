<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (seeks closure yet opens wounds) act in scene via scar-tracing and plant-listening; final renunciation ("no longer a closure seeker") earned by seed-merge with palpable weep-cost, avoiding epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of revelations (scar → ivy → rings → seed) builds to CR closure in palm-dissolve and spiral image, with cost legible in "wept... for the lie"; orientation anchored early in tower post-surgery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tower, ivy, cellar, tunnel constrain choices (roots part as invitation, ivy bows at end); recurring ivy charges final image, sensory details (moss-slick flagstones, turned earth) mirror internal hush without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (read scar's displaced miracle) signaled early, tightens via ivy-coordinates and ring-memory narrowing path; agency in palm-press and kneel forecloses closure-lie with weep-cost charging final spiral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (stories as continuation, not closure) emerges from particulars (scars/roots/seed); final spiral rings/hourglass reweights premise non-literally, resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (reads scars/rings/plants); rhythmic prose ("meteor hush stitched with awe and dread") modulates intensity, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "roots parted like curtains"); figurative language purposeful in lyric mode without muddle or loops, though dense metaphors border overwriting in tunnel beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: accidental plant-telepathy + coffee-ring memories + scar-seed merge transforms introspection tropes; risk-taking in textural fantasy heightens stakes, inevitable in spiral payoff.</comment>
