<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied empathy in shadow measurements and tasting tears; contradictory ache for unexperienced lives drives micro-choices to self-inclusion. Final smile for her own erasure earns change with cost. Minor abstract phrasing in early nostalgia averted by scene actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shadows to whispers to raindrop signing as Charged Poise/CR, reweighting her identity with erasure cost legible in "preemptively nostalgic for her own eventual erasure." Orientation anchored by ~50 words. Single scene fits defaults perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains via tactile whispers climbing spine and refracting memory, charging closure's raindrop signature. Sensory hierarchy (shadows, vibrations, tastes) filters through archivist's empathetic bias. Final fog-crack evolution mirrors internal hush without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sculpt identity) signaled early, escalates via deepening memory density under Accumulative lens, narrowing to self-erasure trade-off. Agency in conjecturing immersion forecloses detachment with felt cost in pulsing vellum. One tightening (vibrations into marrow) suffices; cost unmistakable in descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-tactile-archive emerges organically from shadow-grief metrics and whispers; final raindrop sigh reconfigures premise without moralizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from resurrecting others into self. Counter-reading (surrender vs. resurrection) adds ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (measuring grief via paces, tasting salt) modulates rhythmically; syntax reflects empathetic immersion. Stable close-third POV; compression taught early, pays off in charged final image. No head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: every line advances texture or conjecture. Varied rhythm passes read-aloud; figurative language (shadows as "slow hands counting griefs") coherent, pattern-taught without muddle. No loops, scaffolds, or overwriting in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist measuring collective grief via shadows/crystals transforms archival trope into tactile resurrection. Risky lyric accumulation heightens preemptive nostalgia stakes organically. Final vellum pulse inevitable from particulars, no hedging.</comment>
