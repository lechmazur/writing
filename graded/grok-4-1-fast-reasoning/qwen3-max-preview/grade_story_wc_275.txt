<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—father's violent legacy vs. chosen gentleness—act simultaneously in the knife-sheathing ritual and seed-giving, earning the final child's interaction as Earned Stasis with visible cost of forgoing brutality. Interiority is concrete and particular, embodied in petal tremors and root grief. No safety-hedging; flaws like perceptiveness complicate isolation but drive continuity stake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of vignettes builds pattern of quiet continuity, taught early via farm/knife, tightening to child's question as Conceptual Repricing where plants "hold space" reconfigures post-tower void with conceptual cost of softness amid ash. Orientation anchored by ~50 words (dome, farm, post-tower). Closure legible on-page in final cutting gift; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass dome and red soil constrain choices (protecting beauty vs. outer rubble), sensory hierarchy POV-specific (perceptive noticing of petal tremors pre-wind). Sandbag scrap recurs as grounding "ballast for the soul," charging closure image. Details evolve (sun to dusk) and mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weave continuity vs. brutality) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through visitor challenges—one-fingered man's question deepens pressure—culminating in child's query forcing stance crystallization. Agency in renunciations (knife sheathing, plant gifts) forecloses violence path with felt cost in "world softer... to live in." One tightening sufficient; minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of continuity emerges organically from particulars (roots embracing shards, seed gifts), reweighted in closure image of girl's dirt-nails departure answering "plants remember?" without moral. Subtext in silences and implications avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers in unforgiven world. Final non-literal resonance: scent over screams.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (senselessly perceptive noticing grief-curl roots, petal tremors) biases details character-specifically; rhythmic modulation builds lyrical texture under low pressure. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Continuity," seed-handing), advances via implication. Stable close-3rd POV; purposeful compression legible, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "violence folded away, not forgotten" advances character/theme); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwriting: metaphors dense ("liquid gold... tranquil blaze") in opening but pattern-taught, not obscuring closure. No loops/artifacts; slight paraphrase in sheathing repetitions dulled mid non-peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-tower pacifist inculcating values in roses transforms tropes via "engraved quiet" and sandbag memory; bold lyric risk heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise (beauty-weaving in ash) inevitable from particulars; no derivative echoes.</comment>
