<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in clasp resistance and embodied exposure post-unhook, earning change with vulnerability cost; therapy-speak like "protected vulnerability" is minor, offset by concrete micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via chime density to RR closure in cloak shed with exposure cost; orientation anchored in opening lines; single scene fits scope perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse balcony constrains (railing snag, eaves chimes) and charges final descent/seashell image; sensory hierarchy (salt breeze, cold rock) reflects POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (certainty vs. nuance) signaled early, tightens via insistent chimes to agency-driven unhook with legible exposure cost under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of nuanced doubt emerges organically via cloak/mirror shifts, resonant in final question-offer image without moralizing; reweights premise non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical perceptual signature (chimes as "metallic sighs") modulates rhythmically under stress; stable single POV with purposeful compression legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops; figurative pattern (whispers, sighs) taught early, coherent in peak unhook beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of conscience trade, chime code, literal doubt-cloak transforms introspection trope; risk-taking lyric heightens stakes to inevitable unhook.</comment>
