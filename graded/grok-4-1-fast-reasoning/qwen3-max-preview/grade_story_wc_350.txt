<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Empathetically decisive trait drives precise singing and anchoring choices with embodied commitment; interiority concrete via talisman selection and multilingual weaving. Final renunciation of weight forecloses isolation path with felt permanence. Minor flaw: minimal contradictory impulses shown in scene, but actions align holistically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vibrations build density from song to seismic response, culminating in RR (Charged Poise) as doors open and town stirs. Orientation anchored early via tower climb. Cost legible in weight's permanent descent: "a permanent anchor, a promise."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower's memory core and brass dials constrain singing tactics; cuckoo weight as micro-setting charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (echoes, glows, creaks) filters through Elara's choral priorities. Valley choreography coherent, evolving with vibrations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rehabilitate elevator) signaled early, escalates via language density and response ("Хліб не вмирає"), narrowing to communal invitation. Agency in song anchors pressure; cost in weight's forfeiture alters valley stasis. One tightening sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of voices/bridges emerges via particulars (silos to sanctuary); final image reconfigures isolation without moral ("Bridges... require weight"). Subtext in multilingual exchange resists binaries. Resonance from Rumi/Shona integration, non-literal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual bias choral (tones as "bridges"); rhythm modulates from hush to chime cascade. Elevator "dialogue" subtextual, goal-pursuing. No head-hopping; diction idiomatic to librarian's multilingual world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "boots echoing like metronome ticks"); rhythm varies for propulsion. Minor figurative density ("zodiacs mid-dance") in ascent beat, but pattern-taught as celestial motif pays off. No loops; clean propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: choral rehab of talking silo via tower harmonics transforms anthropomorphism into communal anthem. Risk in multilingual sonics heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from "grain-dust" grief to "earned sunrise."</comment>
