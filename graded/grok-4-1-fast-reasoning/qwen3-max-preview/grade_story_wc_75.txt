<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to rescue arts intensifies through persistent actions like bread-baking and lens-scanning, earning her shift from ghost-hunting to framing living moments. Interiority embodied in "lavender and grief" kneading; micro-choices reveal values under grief's pressure. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses shown in peak revival beat slightly tempers from 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from solitary scans to communal music, tightening at boy's drum discovery ("I remember the drum") into closure's CR via "We are not preserving art. We are becoming it." Orientation anchored early in grotto details; felt cost in ongoing "practice" reconfigures silence into renaissance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto's damp stone, slick staircases, and waterfall roar constrain climbs and amplify echoes, mirroring internal thaw; rosewater dread evolves with dough's lavender. Recurrent stalactites as "chandeliers" charge music night; final steam from initials ties micro-setting to transformed sanctuary image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescuing arts vs. grief's silence—tightens accumulatively via bread rituals to drum beat, forcing communal stance crystallization. Elara's agency in offerings forecloses isolation with practice's visible cost; no reversals needed under lens, but price legible in "frost from their spirits" dissolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of art-as-inheritance emerges organically from bread mnemonics and lens glimmers, reweighting preservation in final whisper without overt moralizing. Bread shapes shift from grief-triggers to survival symbols; rosewater dread's transformation resonates as counter-reading to loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with artistic perceptual signature (e.g., "etched into wet stone"); rhythmic prose modulates from dread to warmth. Boy's whisper natural and goal-driven; no head-hopping, diction biased toward cultural salvage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density: lines like "edible archives" advance character, stakes, atmosphere; varied rhythm breathes with revival's cadence. No loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors; "steam rose from fresh initials" propels closure image crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bread-as-initials and lens-for-living-moments synthesize post-trauma renewal uniquely, transforming elegy into "renaissance carved into limestone." Risky accumulative revival from beekeeper's absence feels inevitable; no derivative echoes.</comment>
