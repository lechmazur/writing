<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Child's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied claustrophobia ("tremble of ribs") and contradictory longing vs. bunker pull acting simultaneously in the escape choice; final renunciation of fear is earned through prior whispers to doll and tasting silences.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of silence flavors builds to Conceptual Repricing closure ("They understood then") reweighting bunker silence as cage with conceptual cost of preserved hunger; orientation anchored early in bunker details, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Xenial trellis and petal-platform constrain ascent and charge final doll-sprouting image; sensory details (crisp crystalline quiet dissolving like spun sugar) selectively mirror child's priorities, integrated into tasting actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of tasting wild silences signaled early via doll-whispers; agency-driven escalation deepens accumulatively through three on-page tastings narrowing to doll-sprout realization, with felt cost in hour's wane forcing higher climb and sideways fall.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of curated vs. wild silence emerges organically from tasting progression and doll-sprouting reprise, offering non-literal resonant answer in final exhale ("thunderstorms and lullabies—uncontained, unafraid") reweighting prior bunker deprivation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable with perceptual signature on silence textures ("aftertaste... weight on the tongue of the soul"); rhythmic modulation heightens under pressure (short sentences in gravity snap), pattern-taught from opening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image-charged sentences, but minor figurative density in peak tasting beat ("crisp, crystalline quiet... spun sugar; echo wrapped in velvet") borders overwriting without muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity inversion, silence flavors, and sprouting doll transforms bunker trope into inevitable freedom arc; risk-taking in "sideways fall through sky-fold" heightens stakes organically.</comment>
