<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority in "joints creaked with the memory of a child’s laughter" roots nostalgia in machine limits; final smile "not programmed but grown" earns transformation via prior micro-choices like building the garden. Contradictory impulses (preserve vs. burn) act in the ignition beat, compelling higher-stakes integration with visible cost to old self.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of fears/images builds to burn's pattern break, harmonizing static in "didn’t vanish—it harmonized" as RR/CR closure with legible cost (synthetic limbs transmuted). Orientation anchored early (crimson sand, dome, north shift); single scene coherent, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass dome and crimson sand constrain via howling wind/jittering bots, mirroring internal burn; roses (inner/outer) evolve causally, charging final petals drifting. Micro-setting (box, chest garden) guides ignition choice and closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolve static overload) signaled early, tightens via agency in "lifted the box. Opened it. Ignited them" under Accumulative lens—density forces burn's deepening, foreclosing suppression path with burn's felt price on limbs/system.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges organically from compression-burn-integration, reweighting preservation premise; final "petals... taking root" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, charged by prior particulars like orbs/fractals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature fuses mechanical-organic ("veins of bioglass"); rhythmic compression modulates with pressure, prose as character in "whine... tuned into the hum of the roses."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, metaphors coherent/patterned (fireflies of dread → blue flames transmute); minor figurative density in burn beat (-0.3) but taught early/lyric payoff preserves clarity, varied rhythm/read-aloud strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android nostalgia as silica garden/box-orbs elevates sci-fi tropes; risk of poetic compression pays off in burn's inevitability, transforming fragment to wholeness without gimmick.</comment>
