<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glassblower's contemplative motivation shines through micro-choices like reverent sweeping and bookmark-sealing, embodying contradictory impulses of control-abandonment; final heart-thaw earned via ritual pressure without epiphanic overreach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as narrated ritual builds density to Charged Poise closure—"She walked into the slush-laden streets... heart... melting"—with legible conceptual cost of initiating thaw via abandonment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory details like "drip-drip-drip" and furnace hum constrain choices (scavenged fuel) and charge final spheres' chimes; thawing setting mirrors internal reconfiguration without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of crafting inquiry zones tightens accumulatively through ritual beats to departure, forcing trade-off of occupation for release; cost felt in "groaned shut" door and left-behind sanctuaries.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Thaw-as-inquiry theme emerges organically from spheres cradling questions, reweighted in child-bookmark image without moralizing; resonant non-literal close ties arc to complexity of fragile wonder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable with perceptual signature (mundane as sacred); rhythmic prose modulates from chill to glow, teaching pattern early for legible contemplative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel via image integration, but figurative layering ("breath curling like steam... ice whispered") borders overwriting in crafting peak (-0.4); no loops dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glassblower ritual in control room transforms post-Frost tropes into inquiry sanctuaries; risk-taking in weighty-lyric voice heightens thaw stakes organically.</comment>
