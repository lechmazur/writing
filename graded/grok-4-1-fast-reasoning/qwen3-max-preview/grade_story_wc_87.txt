<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously (vectors vs. tides in opening); micro-choices like naming poles earn final paddle with visible cost of surrendered precision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density via pole-naming to crow washer; Charged Poise closure lands cleanly at "compass needle finally stilled—not pointing north, but pointing toward her stern" with felt cost of obsolete skills.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Poles and kayak as micro-setting constrain choices (inland pull, waiting hull); final paddle image charged by their "ragged salute," mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcome regret stasis) signaled early, tightens via pole-walk agency narrowing options; cost legible in "backlash... lost its grip" but lacks one deeper reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect motion emerges organically from particulars; final laugh offers resonant answer to navigation-by-precision question, reweighting poles/stars without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in nautical-math metaphors (equations, vectors, latitude); rhythmic control modulates with pressure, syncing to "stroke by stroke" without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "salt wind tangling... unresolved equations"); varied rhythm passes ear test, minor opening metaphor stack purposeful for voice but borders overwrite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poles-as-stars and self-pointing compass transforms regret trope; risk of absurd coping heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
