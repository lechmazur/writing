<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grandmother's motivation to evolve tradition is concrete and intensifies through micro-choices like chanting hybrid syllables from glyphs and plants; embodied refusal via gnarled fingers and creaking joints reveals character under pressure. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene slightly tempers perfection, but earned change in offering "Choose" forecloses compliance with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: decoding to chanting to amber blooming/surging inward builds density to RR (Charged Poise) closure with conceptual cost of seeding insurgency risk legible in mist dispersal and clearer springs. Single scene anchors orientation early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Volcanic setting constrains via vines steadying wrists and obsidian altar charging the ritual; sensory details (steam breath, ground hum) filter through POV memory of soil, evolving to seedlings in ash. Recurrent kite in tree charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unseal to seed evolved destiny) tightens texturally via chant-induced glow/cracks, narrowing to agency in "Choose" whisper; cost felt in land's internalization foreclosing personal control. Escalation coheres under accumulative lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of intentional evolution emerges organically from glyph-decoding, plant communion, and mist-seeding; final seedlings humming script reweights tradition-as-possibility without moralizing, inviting ambiguity on insurgency's quiet cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of plant-sighs and glyph-shimmers; syntax/rhythm modulate from reflective to reverent at "light pulsed once, then surged," heightening pressure legibly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image-chains like "cracks spiderwebbed... blooming"; figurative density purposeful and mythic-consistent, no loops or artifacts dulling closure image of twitching kite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant-telepathy, kite-script decoding, and amber-embryo insurgency transforms tropes; risk in quiet recalibration ("no grand explosion") heightens stakes organically to inevitable seedling payoff.</comment>
