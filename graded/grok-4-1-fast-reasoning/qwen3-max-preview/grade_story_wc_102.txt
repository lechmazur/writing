<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Artist's motivation rooted in gnawing question drives micro-choices like breath alteration and kneeling; embodied tremors and hitched breath show contradiction under pressure. Final permeation earns change with surrender cost. No strong simultaneous impulses acting, but pivotal climax clean.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from obscura image to mist unfurling as Conceptual Repricing—"unused love was not stored; it was sung"—with permeation cost legible in final image. Orientation anchored early at viaduct; single scene coherent. No lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (jasmine/scorched parchment scent cues memory; bioluminescent vines pulse with breath) filters through artist's priorities, guiding path up viaduct to constrain choices. Final blooming viaduct charges closure image purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate unused love) signaled early tightens via tear sighting and breath-followed deepening, narrowing to surrender under Accumulative lens; permeation forecloses seeking with felt bodily cost. One decisive intensification suffices; agency in matching breath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: question answered non-literally by mist chorus permeating body, reweighting storage as sung reservoir without moral. Final image resonates with prior petals/faces motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (inverted blossoms, liquid glint) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from humming instrument to tidal breath syncopation under pressure. Purposeful compression legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally with scene (short hitched breaths amid longer tidal exhalations); high density integrates image/action without loops or scaffolds. Minor metaphor density in obscura chamber ("drowned stars") purposeful but borders overwrite in peak reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera obscura quest, ember pilgrim, and tear artifact transforms mystical tropes through breath mechanics and love reservoir premise. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes coherently to brighter viaduct close.</comment>
