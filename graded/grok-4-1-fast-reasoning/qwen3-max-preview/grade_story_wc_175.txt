<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong devotional motivation rooted in transient paradox drives micro-choices like tender knotting; embodied emotions in trembling fingers and exhaling bones reveal contradictions without label-speak. Final renunciation of touching the monarch feels earned by prior rooting/wandering tension. Minor slip: self-label "transiently rooted" borders on diagnostic without full embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from wing-brush to spiral-completion to departure, culminating in Charged Poise closure where monarch lifts from unraveling shrine, reweighting ephemerality with conceptual cost of dissolution ("by morning, rain would loosen"). Orientation anchors early; one tightening via ritual cadence suffices. No lens ambiguity or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (dew-slick stone, gold-green light, ferns curling) filter through devotional POV; grotto/stump constrain building choices, moss-thread enables knots. Recurring monarchs charge final image, mirroring internal vanishing. Micro-setting (moth wing cradle) elevates closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honor histories via ephemeral signal) signaled early; accumulative escalation via ritual density forces stance crystallization in final bow/leave, foreclosing permanence with felt cost of unraveling ("only indentation in the moss"). Agency in knotting/renunciation drives under lens; monarch benediction complicates without resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of dignifying vanishing emerges organically from wing-shrine-monarch arc; final image ("carrying... a history briefly... remembered") offers resonant CR repricing erasure without moralizing. Subtext in non-touching honors ambiguity; elders' silence anchors without intrusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (absences, blushes, interrupted cadences); rhythmic prose modulates from deliberate to dissolving cadence. No elision or head-hopping; diction reflects transient devotion without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel ritual beats; purposeful "blush"/"knot" motifs avoid loops. Minor overwrite: stacked metaphors ("interrupted cadence made visible, audible, sacred") slightly muddle peak breeze moment, dulling propulsion without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual devotion and eco-elegy transforms trope of impermanence via esoteric realist's signals; bold lyric risk in accumulative shrine-building heightens stakes, with monarch reprise feeling inevitable. No template echoes; closure image singular.</comment>
