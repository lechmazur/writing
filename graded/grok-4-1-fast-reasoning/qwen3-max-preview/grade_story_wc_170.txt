<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Personal revelation in third mirror earns continuity with subtle cost of self-recognition, rooting motivation in borrowed hope; embodied via palm press and humming, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously on page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density via mirror sequence tightening to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in terrace's release sigh and her non-look-back vanishing after glyphs/prism anchor orientation early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism parapet and tarnished mirrors constrain painting rite and charge final gleaming doorways; sensory hierarchy (tactile stone, visual fractures, auditory hush) mirrors internal release without stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to coax possibilities escalates texturally through sequential mirror fissures under lens; agency in humming/song weaves pressure, cost felt in amplified return and personal mirror trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of alive mirrors and shadow-yield reconfigures fear-to-possibility without moralizing; theme emerges organically from heartbeat code and fractures, inviting ambiguity in what-might-be.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in light/memory bias; rhythmic modulation peaks in hush-pause, diction controlled and voice-motivated without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful light-fracture pattern propels via varied rhythm; minor figurative density in mirror reactions coherent but borders overwrite without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of heartbeat-borrowing as pigment transforms tropes into inevitable rite; risk in lyric mirrors/possibilities heightens stakes, fully committed to premise without retreat.</comment>
