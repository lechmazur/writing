<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in texture-to-sound revival, embodied in selective feeding of diamond and grounded veins; interiority concrete via patterns and syllables. Minor slip: contradictory impulses more implied via backstory than simultaneous in scene peak. Final endurance earned with tears but lacks hairline scene friction for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from waiting to birds' syntax, diamond filtration, voice emergence. Closure as RR/CR on-page—"She opened her mouth... spoke her mother’s tongue"—with legible cost in "She wept, but did not stop speaking" and grounding into earth. Orientation anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: echoes layer time, bone towers tremble in recognition, constraining climax amplification. Canyon acoustics as recurring micro-setting charge final image of forward echoes. POV bias filters via pattern legibility; no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—revive lost language—tightens via birds' arrival and diamond's vacuum, narrowing to filtered signal. Agency in raising diamond and speaking forecloses silence with on-page tears and sated curse. Accumulative escalation coherent; cost unmistakable in "grounding it into the earth so it would not vanish again."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of texture-to-voice emerges via particulars: extinct glyphs in flight, filtered resonance, responsive echoes. Final image—"new echoes bloomed... forward, into the world"—resonates non-literally, reweighting forgetting vs. persistence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with perceptual signature: syntax in wings, timbre hunger. Rhythmic prose modulates precisely—"Quietly. Precisely."—under pressure; diction controlled, lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-task (e.g., "flock’s rhythm strike its surface" advances plot/atmosphere). Varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figuratives purposeful, not muddled in peak ("The air thickened with texture made audible"). Propulsion peaks cleanly at speaking.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: curse as hunger filtering noise for texture-signal, birds writing grammars, veins conducting revival. Risky lyric accumulation inevitable in hindsight; closure—"echoed her final word... forward"—transforms tropes organically.</comment>
