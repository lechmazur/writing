<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied emotion and micro-choices shine in "boots crunching through the last brittle crust... ache in her ribs," rooting motivation in betrayal and legacy; earned stasis in final lightness despite heavy body shows contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in "She walked away... mist swallowing her silhouette," reconfiguring survival to legacy; cost legible in scorched life entrusted to unseen thaw, orientation anchored early without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Snow and mist constrain choices ("testing footholds, letting the mist veil") and charge final image ("sent it spiraling into the valley like scattered pages"); selective sensory hierarchy reflects spy urgency, no white-room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (plant truth for reckoning) signaled early, tightens via planting microfilm despite burns; agency in renunciation forecloses retrieval with felt cost ("legs unsteady... spirit strangely light"), coherent escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of mending records emerges organically from planting act, resonant CR in "burned spy became the quiet gardener... planting seeds in frozen earth"; non-literal answer reweights betrayal without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("wind shifts, testing footholds") biases toward spy caution; stable close-third POV with rhythmic modulation under reflective pressure, no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density propels but figurative overload ("ice dared to weep... antenna crooked like a broken promise") in most sentences dulls peak planting beat without pattern payoff; minor paraphrase loops in snow motifs, varied rhythm saves high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spy trope into lyric planting of legacy transforms betrayal into seasonal sabotage; risk in quiet surrender heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via pillbox-to-hatch progression.</comment>
