<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Logically emotional trait drives embodied adaptation in syncing steps and counter-song, with awe trembling against calculation; final exhaustion as earned change forecloses isolation into guardianship. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via intensifying vibrations from ice groans to sonic wave; RR closure in Heartstone's forgiving pulse and exhaustion lands on-page with legible cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drift-ice floes constrain steps and guide to lighthouse; key and mercury basin charge final alignment image. Sensory hierarchy (vibrational over visual) reflects engineer's perceptual bias under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to protect Heartstone tightens via sonic harpoon assault, forcing vibrational counter-agency; exhaustion and transmuted malice deliver unmistakable cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Harmony-through-frequency theme emerges organically from adaptation beats, resonating in final sea sigh without moralizing; final image reweights violence-as-dissonance non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with resonant diction and rhythmic throbs matches focalizer's vibrational signature; stable close-3rd POV biases toward harmonics without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "boots crunching over unstable plates" advances action/setting/character); purposeful figurative pattern in pulses avoids muddle, though minor synonym churn on "vibration" caps below 9.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sonic Heartstone premise synthesizes engineering mythos freshly, with vibrational defense transforming scavenger tropes; risk in abstract harmonics pays off in audible closure grace.</comment>
