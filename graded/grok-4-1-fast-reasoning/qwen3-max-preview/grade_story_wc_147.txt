<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act vividly in the climax—"Instinct shrieked: seal it, flee, survive. But she forced her hand to stay open"—earning the final renunciation with embodied cost of oxygen depletion and death.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density deepens to closure's Conceptual Repricing: vial shatters "releasing its stored echoes," reconfiguring time as "rippled, eternal" with legible cost in "her vision dimmed and the last bubbles left her lips."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Temple's "gathered hush" and "velvet quiet" constrain the choice to stay vulnerable, charging the final image of "shards... pulsing faintly" as seeds of remembrance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of vial activation tightens via deepening hush and "oxygen alarm pulsed faster," driven by agency in overriding instinct; cost unmistakable in bodily sinking amid resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of surrender to ephemeral emerges organically, answered non-literally by "to harness... was not to capture it, but to become its vessel," reweighting prior trauma echoes without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via sonic lens ("whispered like mourners," "dissolved" sound) sustains rhythmic control under stress, with stable close-third POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but figurative density in climax ("salt and sorrow and starlight") borders overwriting without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic archaeology and memory-resonator vial transforms underwater trope into inevitable resonance payoff, with bold lyric risk heightening stakes.</comment>
