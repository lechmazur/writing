<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concrete interiority via sea glass as embodied anchor and ritual micro-choices reveal reticent endurance against grief; final humming renunciation earns Charged Poise with visible cost in transformed ache.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through ritual density to on-page Charged Poise closure ("ache...luminescent, glowing softly"); cost legible in endured loss pulsing as beacon, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lantern room's "creak...sigh...ghost-light" and west window constrain stone ritual; sea glass charges final image, sensory hierarchy skipper-specific (boots echoing like heartbeats).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tend fragile connections) signaled early, tightens via flicker-forced stones under Textural lens; agency in ritual forecloses isolation with felt endurance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of chained compassion emerges organically via letters/stones/glass; final image ("sea glass...pulsed...second heart") offers non-literal resonant reweighting of loneliness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable close-third perceptual signature (salt-spray quietude, humming as joy's echo) with rhythmic modulation; purposeful compression teaches ritual pattern paid in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm/syntax; minor figurative density ("bruised twilight," "velvet dark") in setup purposeful, no loops/artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of anonymous rituals (letters, stones) transforms lighthouse trope; stone message/stones-glass reprise risks quiet Charged Poise that heightens emotional stakes inevitably.</comment>
