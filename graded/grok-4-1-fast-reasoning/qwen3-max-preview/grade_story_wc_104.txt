<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in planting resilience, shown through precise micro-choices like pressing spores and scattering seeds with whispered names; embodied patience in chains clinking and breath stirring dust. Interiority concrete via soil-rooted metaphors particular to her gardener's worldview. No deep contradictory impulses act simultaneously, but endurance earns closure cost without unmotivated leap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from key decoding to vault breach to scattering, culminating in Charged Poise RR where arrow planting and seed weight reconfigure options with felt cost of chains and risk. Orientation anchored early in carnival center. Single scene tightening via mural slide suffices; closure image of vanishing into wind with spores carries undeniable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory integration: dust motes like pollen, wind's soil scent, constrain choices (piano bench decoding, mural slide). Carnival micro-setting (clown mural, prize toys) charges final arrow marker and seed scattering. POV bias filters through agrarian lens; recurring dirt cracks mirror transformation without overt symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vault breach before wall falls) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via decoding success enabling scatter; agency in patient key presses forecloses violent path with risk cost. Raiders as off-page pressure coheres without resolving via coincidence. On-page trade-off: chains limit escape, but spores/arrow plant legacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inevitable green resilience emerges organically from seed names, arrow signal, soil cracking; final image reweights premise non-literally as "music instead... and green." Subtext in non-violent precision tensions Regime wall. No moralizing; ambiguity in her survival lingers purposefully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable, perceptual signature in organic metaphors (roots seeking water, pollen dance) biases toward growth. Voice modulates rhythmically: short presses build to expansive close. Compression purposeful, taught early; no head-hopping or withhold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers... brushed against the arrow" advances prop/character); rhythm varies for ear, from clipped chains to lingering notes. Minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite but pattern-taught as lyric mode pays at closure. No loops, scaffolds, or template cadence; propulsion clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Piano-key vault in carnival fuses post-apoc tropes freshly via botanical cipher; arrow as signal transforms relic into legacy. Risky lyrical compression heightens stakes organically. Inevitable synthesis: chains enable staggering grace, wall fall irrelevant to seed sow.</comment>
