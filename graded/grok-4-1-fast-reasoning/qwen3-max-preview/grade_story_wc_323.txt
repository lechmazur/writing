<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira's balanced curiosity and necessity-driven motivation compel teaching choices, embodied in anchor chain handling; internal awe during power fluctuation reveals character under subtle pressure. Minor lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal teaching beats prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through shards (classroom to balcony to resolution); orientation anchored early in Maris-7 dome. Closure as Conceptual Repricing via anchor speech reconfigures adaptation with felt cost of past renunciation, but single tightening (power fluctuation) lacks micro-reversal depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Benthic details (bioluminescent towers, pressure dome hiss) selectively constrain perception and charge final holomap overlay; recurring anchor silhouettes starfield in closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elira's navigational priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (starlight navigation post-aliens) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via student struggle to power fluctuation deepening, forcing Elira's anchor stance. Kael's question tests commitment; resolution crystallizes endurance with adaptation cost legible in class success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of adaptability emerges organically from anchor evolution ("not weights... navigators") and edge geometry praxis, reweighting unfolded universe in final students' sextant proficiency. Resonant non-literal closure answers "getting lost" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV with perceptual bias (star-charts as tactile salvation); voice texture modulates poetically from class explanation to balcony awe. Dialogue natural/subtextual (Kael's "What if we get lost?" pursues goal, reveals status).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (short balcony sentences vs. flowing holotank descriptions); no loops, purposeful "edge geometry" recurrence. Minor figurative density in opening ("invisible lace") risks overwrite but integrates without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of abyssal isolation and non-Euclidean nav transforms tropes; anchor's reprise from relic to compass feels inevitable, risking bold sci-fi lyricism that heightens stakes.</comment>
