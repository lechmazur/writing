<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exemplary embodied interiority and motivation rooted in rebellion, with contradictory impulses in fatigue vs. persistence during the dance; final teaching choice earned by exile's solitude foreclosing isolation at cost of scars and blood. Micro-choices like pressing speck to collarbone reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from steps to speck discovery to exhaustive dance, culminating in CR closure via villagers' arrival reweighting ban's rule-set; cost legible in "feet bled faintly into the moss." Orientation anchored early in garden/twilight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden's moss/dew/petals constrain dance (soles brushing, petals trembling) and charge final image of communal twilight steps; sensory hierarchy (tactile tides, stellar hum) reflects POV urgency without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory rebellion vs. ban) signaled early, escalates via speck surge tightening to sacrificial dance; agency in inscribing verse forecloses solitude with bleeding feet cost unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory as contraband-turned-compass emerges from dance glyphs and speck echo, resonant non-literal answer in child's dandelion and her vow without moralizing; final image reweights exile premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (gaps, gravitational sighs) stable in third-limited POV, rhythmic modulation heightens dance pressure; child's whisper natural/subtextual, distinguishing from narrative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels to closure, but figurative overload in dance beat ("arcs against star-strewn sky," "silver rivers") risks muddle without full pattern payoff, docking from 9-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nostalgia ban, tide-anchored skin, and body-inscription verse feels inevitable; risk-taking in lyric accumulation transforms tropes, heightened by obsidian grace tone.</comment>
