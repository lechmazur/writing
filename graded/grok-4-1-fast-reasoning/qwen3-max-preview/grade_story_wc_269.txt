<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's tactile motivation roots in mentor's page and witness past, compelling descent choice with embodied loss; contradictory grief/hope acts in tapping rituals, earning final teaching shift without epiphany shortcuts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via journal/code/rhythm shards to CR closure in "bioluminescent coral spiraled upward," reweighting disappearance with submersion cost felt in patience and slowed cycles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Station's stilts/brine constrain surge retrieval and submersible descent; atlas page as recurring object charges handmade closure image, filtering sensory focus through Elara's tactile bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythmic delay lag deepens stake from loss to hidden life, forcing code dig and hull taps that foreclose vanishing narrative; agency in assembly narrows to submersion revelation with endurance cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Submerged reefs image reconfigures loss-as-metamorphosis without statement, emerging from tapping particulars; final "temple of tactile cartography" resonates via rhythm without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tactile perceptual signature ("tapped the same rhythm") biases noticing, with syntax echoing 17-second pulses; stable limited third holds under pressure, lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety propels without loops, density high in "sonar logs... pulsed in rhythm"; minor intro figurative stack purposeful for textural lens, closure chime image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tapping-as-radar synthesizes eco-loss into "periodically eternal" reefs, transforming tropes via geothermal downward growth; risk in lyric accumulation heightens tactile closure without gimmick.</comment>
