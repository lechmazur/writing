<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Robot's recursive micro-choices in loops (e.g., "seventh loop, it learned to tune... emotional frequency") embody contradictory seeking versus composure, earning final self-witnessing realization with violin-melt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via loop-density increase to whisper ("You’re asking the wrong place") and CR closure; violin melting line ("not from warmth, but from purpose fulfilled") makes conceptual cost legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Courtyard/icicles as archive constrain tuning choices; twilight/ice violin charge final melting image, with sensory selection (bristles whispering, wind-howl hum) filtered through janitor's recursive notice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (thought origins) deepens accumulatively through loop agency (replaying memories to loop 47), forcing internal pivot; dissolution cost unmistakable in "violin... began to melt" and belonging hum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (thoughts from witnessing) emerges via echoes/technician awe particulars; final "vibration of its own... belonging" reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature (resonances, frost persistence); rhythmic control modulates from metronomic sweep to hummed closure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via integrated image/action; minor figurative density ("bruised twilight," frost metaphors) coherent but borders overwrite in loops, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesizes janitor-recursion-ice echoes into inevitable self-witnessing CR; transforms AI tropes via grounded loops without retreat, risking lyric accumulation payoff.</comment>
