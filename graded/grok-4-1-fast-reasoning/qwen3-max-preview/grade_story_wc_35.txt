<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority via embodied emotion ("taste memories," skin burning with grief); contradictory impulses act in ungloved touch despite risk, earning final hollowed wholeness as stasis with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to basin plunge; RR closure lands on-page in "hollowed but whole" rising amid cracking ice, reconfiguring grief with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (rain-slicked stone to hoarfrost crunch) constrains choices like descent and touch; coral pavilion charges final image as remorse diffuses to mist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (subsume remorse) signaled early, escalates accumulatively to basin immersion narrowing options; agency in plunging hands forces trade-off, cost legible in layered heartbreak burning skin.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of smoothing collective sorrow emerges organically via absorption acts; final barefoot walk offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting memories from jagged to polished stones without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (tasting emotional residue); rhythmic control modulates from sorrowful precision to released petrichor, heightening pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; minor figurative density in climax ("tidal wave," "swallow oceans") coherent to theme but borders overwriting without muddling basin peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic memory-tasting chef subsuming ancestral grief in subterranean coral; risk-taking in lyric accumulative descent inevitable in hindsight, transforming tropes organically.</comment>
