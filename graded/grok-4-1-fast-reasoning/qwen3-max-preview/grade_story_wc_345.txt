<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira's altruistic resonance compels collective trust without command, shown in spectral tears cleaning the bell and nudging toward courage; settlers' micro-reactions like Kael's thumb-trace reveal earned change under thinning orchard pressure, balancing competence with spectral limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as chalk messages densify into gathering and bell-ring, yielding Charged Poise closure when nebula shimmers "beyond the seventh arch—not distant, but waiting"; orientation anchors in first paragraph, cost legible in orchard's fraying roots and sighing pride.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Floating rock arches and petrified root-veins constrain the root-path to the seventh arch, charging final image; Glass Canopy and upside-down trees filter through Elira's purpose, with dew-slick moss and violet glow mirroring unity's bloom without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thinning orchard bounty signals dominant survival stake early, tightening via moon-blush synchronization to bell-chime reversal that reweights collective options; agency in Kael's lift and hands clasping bears orchard-loss cost, coherent under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Unity over command emerges organically from chalk fragility to helix-swirl, reweighting strangers-to-family in final "walking together" image without moralizing; brambled hope recurs via rooted whispers and blooming petals, inviting ambiguity in spectral smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical texture with biased noticing—"whispers rooted," "spectral tears"—sustains stable third-person focalization on Elira/group; rhythm modulates from intimate chalk to rippling chime, perceptual signature fantastical yet controlled under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density layers sensory propulsion—"chime like liquid glass"—with varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; minor figurative density in "wings brushing petals into bloom" purposeful for accumulative texture, clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost catalysis via chalk/bell in upside-down orchards transforms unity trope, with nebula pulse as inevitable risk-heightening reconfiguration; no derivative echoes, bold spectral agency coheres vision.</comment>
