<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's interiority concrete and particular, with embodied shifts like trembling chalk and breath catching; motivation intensifies from rebellion to responsible traversal via father's attack. Minor diagnostic slips like "risk without purpose was entropy" slightly abstract emotion, but contradictory impulses act in scene (leaving scrawls despite ache) and final endurance earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scrawl discoveries and responses build density to CR closure ("Begin again") with legible cost in melancholy paths not taken. Orientation anchored early (library, Elara post-attack); one tightening via interactive scrawls narrows isolation into network recognition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mica pane as recurring micro-setting constrains perception and charges final glow/image; rainwashed library sensory-selective (wet paper, cedar) mirrors internal veils. Subway seats and father's room evolve causally, filtering through probabilistic bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (responsible widening) signaled early, escalates via scrawl network and father link under accumulative lens, forcing endurance with cost in "clover melancholy" ache. Agency in interpreting/leaving scrawls narrows options; one deepening via response reply suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of contradiction-as-invitation emerges organically from scrawls/glyphs; final notebook image resonant CR reweights rebellion into poise without moralizing. Clover motif shifts from ache to resilience, charging closure non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single POV with perceptual signature (probabilistic lens on shadows/scrawls); rhythmic diction modulates from flickering unease to warm curl. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("just glass and rock"); no head-hopping, compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density, varied rhythm propels via image over scaffold; "lucid contradictions" purposeful pattern, not loop. Minor paraphrase in reflections ("widening perspectives") but no closure dulling; strong verbs anchor vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Probabilistic runes/scrawls transform graffiti trope into fresh network; lantern's paradoxical glow inevitable synthesis of inheritance/rebellion. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes organically, no hedging.</comment>
