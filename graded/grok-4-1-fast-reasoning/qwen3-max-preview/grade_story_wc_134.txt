<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in her twitching toward the pearl despite no intent, earning the final understanding via forgotten wish vision; pilgrim's pressure reveals her blind spots without stereotypes. Interiority embodied in hand tremor and vision's sharpness under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (thrum, glow, shadows) builds to CR closure in pearl pulsing dark and integrated realization, with cost legible in gift's failure and buried memory surfacing. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored by pilgrim's arrival in first graph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cave's bending light and crystal floor constrain shadows/forces, charging final exhale/hum image; sensory hierarchy (acoustics echoing questions, prismatic shards) mirrors her perceptual bias without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control magic amplification) deepens texturally via pearl's unintended call, narrowing to stance crystallization; pilgrim kneeling triggers thrum, forcing pearl draw with visible cost in vision tearing through.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of everyday magic including unseen emerges organically via shadows' integration, final hand-hold reweighting premise without moralizing; resonant CR avoids tidy binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (visions in bursts, sideways riddles) stable in limited third; sparse dialogue subtextual ("You called them") advances under Accumulative lens, rhythms modulate with pulse intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax (short gasps amid flowing descriptions); metaphors cohere (ink shadows, struck chimes) without muddle, no loops though minor figurative density in buildup serves texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh irony transforms clairvoyant trope via self-amplified unseen in singing cave; pearl's wish reveal and bright-dark synthesis feel inevitable, risking lyric ambiguity for charged poise.</comment>
