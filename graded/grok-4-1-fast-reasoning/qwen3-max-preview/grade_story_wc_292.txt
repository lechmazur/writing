<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's "nervously confident" trait embodies contradictory impulses—trembling fingers yet "electric certainty"—driving her decoding and transcription choices with ancestor-rooted motivation. Final renunciation of fear as "compass" earns closure shift. No safety-hedging; flaws like guild exile compound into pilgrimage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: journal discovery → stanza transcription → storm dialogue → jet stream shift (DC) with nail's burn as felt cost. Orientation anchors early (Elara at station post-jet shift). Closure reconfigures exile via on-page weaving of coordinates.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Copper nail constrains (warms, burns) and charges final pocket slip; station's resonance board and alarms guide transcription choice. Sensory hierarchy (salt-ink pages, groaning sky) filters via Elara's cartographic bias. Micro-setting (nail, board) alters tactics at climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake (reverse exile/prove maps control weather) tightens causally via stanza realization, narrowing to storm-questioning agency with nail-burn cost. Escalation forces trade-off: layer coordinates despite alarms. Protagonist alteration (fear → compass) crystallizes at golden shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (erased memories control chaos) emerges via stanzas-as-transmissions, nail-legacy weaving; final journal image non-literally answers "What do you want?" with mercy-path reconfiguration. No moralizing; resonance from drowned grief particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in close third: perceptual bias ("stanzas matching jet stream frequency") modulates rhythmically under stress ("sky cracked open—not with lightning, but with light"). No head-hopping; elision (backstory) anchors to present nail-cue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm ("Clouds unspooled backward. Rain rose."); no loops or muddled metaphors despite poetic density. Minor figurative density in climax ("compass needles caught in a ghost’s grip") purposeful, not obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: coded sailor stanzas control jet stream via nail-forged memory, transforming exile/weather tropes. Risky lyric storm-dialogue heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight from ancestor setup.</comment>
