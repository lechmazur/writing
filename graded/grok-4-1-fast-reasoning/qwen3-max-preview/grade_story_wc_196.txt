<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and motivation rooted in heartbreak sharpening focus, with earned reconfiguration from preserving loss to magnifying kindnesses; micro-choices like photographing dust reveal values under quiet pressure. Minor diagnostic phrasing like "silent ache" borders therapy-speak but stays concrete. Final endurance of pain to serve larger purpose shows hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from button to dust swirls to mapped artifacts, delivering Charged Poise closure in "turning memorials back into living stories" where cost of prior despair reconfigures role. Orientation anchored early in file room post-emancipation. Single tightening via cross-referencing Vance suffices; supervisor ellipsis motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust patterns and button as micro-setting constrain discoveries and charge final image as compass, with sensory hierarchy (visual gradients under lamp) filtered through archivist's reverent bias. Spatial choreography clear across shelves; evolves with light shifts mirroring internal turn. No slips touch closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of heartbreak vs. overlooked tenderness signaled early, tightens accumulatively through artifact chain forcing stance shift; agency in methodical documentation forecloses despair path with felt cost in "pain was gone, but... serve something larger." Visible trade-off in supervisor's initial skepticism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of love persisting in margins emerges organically from particulars like button vow and handprints, reweighted in final sanctuary image without moralizing. Subtext in dust as "whispers" invites ambiguity on institutional indifference. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question of endings vs. beginnings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in "dust... never random," modulating rhythm to emotional peaks; brief dialogue natural, subtext-laden ("files into memorials"). No head-hopping; diction controlled, biased toward archival precision.</comment>
<question>7</grade>8.6<comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "trembling fingers... dust motes danced" advances setting/action/atmosphere); rhythm varies, no loops or scaffolds dull propulsion. Minor figurative density in opening but purposeful, not muddling closure image of button as compass.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on archival work via dust forensics transforms trope of quiet discovery; button's vow and "Magnifications" log synthesize war orphanhood into non-obvious kindness anthem. Risk in textural drive pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
