<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in personal loss compels ritualistic choices, with interiority concrete via clipboard's sensory details; micro-choices like color-coding keys reveal values. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a high-pressure beat, keeping it from exceptional. Endurance of ephemerality earned but not tested pivotally on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ritual to mission, cadence shift in final standing/tucking reconfigures meaning via chalk's half-life ("half-gone, half-alive"). Orientation anchored by ~50 words (arcade at dawn, her kneeling). Closure as CR with conceptual cost of impermanence legible in last lines; one tightening via today's widow's encoding suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Golden arcade's honeyed light, brass chutes, and pigeons selectively mirror her nostalgic rite, constraining choice to this analog temple over digital. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased toward tactile slowness (chalk-scraping, ink drying). Final glow charges closure image, evolving with her rise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (smuggle meaning past algorithms) signaled early, deepens via widow's heavy words forcing inventive calibration under lens. Agency in juxtaposing games/endurance forecloses instant paths with felt cost (rain-erasure sacred). Escalation via density to poised action; no external antagonist limits to strong.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of marginal meaning emerges implicitly from chalk grids vs official mail, final image ("deeper...drawn") reweights premise non-literally with ephemerality's cost. Resonance from particulars like hopscotch "FORGIVE ME," inviting reflection on slow kindness. No moralizing; ambiguity in kids' unwitting role lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature in chalk/mail filters (e.g., "souls" in stamps). Prose texture rhythmic, modulating from descriptive to charged poise; diction biased toward analog tactility. No head-hopping or withholding; compression purposeful for lyric build.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density: lines layer image/voice (e.g., "pigeons and...bakery carts") without loops; rhythm varies, propels to closure. No scaffold, figurative coherence (honeyed light, ghosts humming). Minor repetition in ephemerality lists patterned and taught early.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of playground codes smuggling adult grief transforms mail trope via kid-mediated delay. Risk in lyric-ephemeral structure heightens stakes of impermanence; no hedging, fully commits to chalk's fragile hope charging end.</comment>
