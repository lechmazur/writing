<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied recognition ("gasped — not from shock, but recognition") linking her unsent letters to the film's, earning the closure choice to release with contradictory impulses of seeking versus personal silence vividly acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from film press to compartment discovery to letters, delivering on-page Conceptual Repricing closure ("unused love doesn’t vanish — it incubates") with felt emotional cost in her "ribs like a second skeleton"; orientation anchored early, one tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting as micro-world constrains via projector baseplate compartment and charges final image ("theater exhaled, its walls lighter"); selective sensory details (ozone, wet stone) mirror internal states through goal-directed action without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early tightens texturally through deepening visions to personal letters, forcing renunciation (hoard vs release) with legible cost in trembling commitment; agency in following echoes narrows options under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of incubated love emerges organically from particulars (film sprockets, yellowed envelopes), reweighted in final marquee glitch and boot rhythm without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in release motion charges prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature ("map emotions like constellations"); rhythmic prose modulates with intensity, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image integration, but figurative density borders overwriting in peak visions (e.g., "lullabies and unwept tears"); no loops, clean syntax supports propulsion without artifacts dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry on celluloid transforms ghost story tropes into emotional archaeology; risk-taking in sustained lyric texture heightens stakes, with premise's non-obvious angle ("where unused love is stored") feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
