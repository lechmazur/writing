<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied grief and contradictory endurance (clutching handle while knowing echoes aren't her voice) compel the final pact with visible emotional cost; interiority particular via musical metaphors tied to leaf blower past. Minor reflection density anchors tightly to present without flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as motif density builds to charged poise closure in final hum and tiny laugh echo, reconfiguring silence into sustaining resonance with felt perpetual cost; orientation anchors early (tunnel, dusk, post-hourglass). Single scene fits defaults flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tunnel's curves amplify sighs into hymns, constraining his stance at the heart and charging final shiver/laugh; pull cord as micro-setting handled tactilely. Sensory hierarchy (echo ricochets, drafts) mirrors perceptual narrowing under grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of extracting laughter fragments escalates texturally via rare tunnel responses culminating in climax laugh burst he kneels to, forcing endurance trade-off; cost legible in fragments' insufficiency yet sustaining him.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow-to-resonance emerges organically from particulars, final image repricing echo as borrowed joy without moralizing; subtext in "fragments are enough" lingers via ambiguity of forgiveness/permission.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited voice with distinct musical/perceptual signature ("off-key wind," warbling notes) modulates rhythmically under pressure; no head-hopping, elision of backstory cued by handle pays off in sway.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm/propulsion (short hum sentences vs. flowing reflections) and zero loops/artifacts; "macerates grief" motif purposeful, not churn. Closure image crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of leaf blower relic conducting absence transforms grief trope into echo-haunted ritual; risk-taking in lyric endurance heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via pact.</comment>
