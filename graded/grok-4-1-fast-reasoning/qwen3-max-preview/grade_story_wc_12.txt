<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Priest's motivation rooted in rhetorical traits intensifies via questions that compel painting the question mark; interiority concrete in warped geometry responses; earned realization ("it was answering") forecloses invasion path with conceptual cost, though fewer contradictory impulses limit 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with rhetorical density building to CR closure ("possession unraveled...into the question itself"); orientation anchored by para 1; single tightening in realization disperses threat with undeniable conceptual cost in final glyph inversion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Palette as micro-setting constrains climax choice (thumb dip paints negation); chamber's warping geometry and sideways drop charge final image; sensory hierarchy (static taste, molar chime) biases through priest's perceptual lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminate before possession) signaled para 1, tightens accumulatively via faltering void to agency-driven painting; cost legible in chamber scream and time hiccup; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of rhetoric dismantling assumptions emerges via spiraling questions reweighting possession as "invitation"; final "What if...only one asking?" offers non-literal resonant answer without moralizing, charging empty palette image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in rhetorical noticing (questions "warp...geometry"); voice rhythm modulates from low threading to scalpel whispers, consistent under stress; purposeful elision of direct dialogue fits lyric compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm, but figurative layering in peak beats ("suction, pulling...into the question") borders overwrite without full sparsity; no loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear in echoing spatial warps.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rhetorical exorcism via silence architecture transforms possession trope organically; risk-taking in anti-sound painting heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from early loop ghosts; singular vision avoids templates.</comment>
