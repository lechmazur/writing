<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elira's contradictory impulses to teach while withholding shine in withholding explanation after stone toss, earning Kael's realization with embodied grief (trembling hands from withheld weight). Micro-choices reveal values; Kael's fascination compounds via prior setup. Final bow forecloses impatience path with patience cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ripples accumulate to symbols in fractured starlight, yielding CR closure where pond reflects stars post-revelation, reweighting vanishing premise with undeniable patience cost. Orientation anchored early (platform, grotto). Single scene tightens meaningfully without slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating platform and grotto constrain meditation choices, charging final valley image as endless waiting. Sensory hierarchy (magnetic thrum, sycamore hush) mirrors trance urgency. Pond ripples evolve causally, mirroring internal states via symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teach vanishing-as-emergence) signaled early, deepens via ripple-to-symbols cadence shift under Accumulative lens, narrowing to descent promise. Agency in Elira's toss/withholding forces Kael's stance crystallization; patience cost legible in deepened breath and bow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of vanishing as preparation emerges via stone's absence expanding meaning, resonant in final pond-as-glass reflecting stars without moral state. Ripples reweight prior withholding; ambiguity lingers in withheld final step.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV (Elira-dominant, clean Kael shift at gasp) with perceptual bias (temporal notation in ripples). Prose texture modulates rhythmically; sparse dialogue carries subtext ("Why?" yields "You've been teaching me to read time").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm (short gasps amid lyrical swells); no loops, but minor overwrought figuration ("syllable by syllable, silence by silence") in opening slightly dulls peak trance without harming closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Backwards-aging expert synthesizing temporal ripples transforms meditation trope into fresh CR on emergence; risk in withholding clarity heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via grotto pulse approval.</comment>
