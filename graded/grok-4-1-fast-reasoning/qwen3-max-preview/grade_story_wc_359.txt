<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Synesthetic embodiment like "taste the G-minor as burnt caramel" reveals particular interiority; micro-choices in strikes earn internalization of song at climax, though lacking contradictory impulses caps below 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with chime density tightening to CR closure: "song now lived in her bones" reconfigures premise with ongoing tending cost; orientation anchored immediately, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ice cavern's responsive hush ("swirled around her ankles") and aurora constrain strikes while charging final image of alive, breathing space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake to certify wonder escalates accumulatively via thawed laughter and final surrender; agency in mallet strikes forecloses sheet reliance with felt cost of daily tending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as oxygen emerges via chime images shifting "sculpted hush" from brittle to radiant; final image reweights without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synesthetic perceptual signature ("smelled of pine and tasted of snowmelt") modulates rhythmically; stable close-third POV with purposeful lyric compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but stacked figures in chime beats ("liquid sapphire, topaz tremors") verge on overwriting without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synesthetic prism-song premise synthesizes fresh angle on wonder, with risk-taking lyric accumulation heightening resonance; chisel motif transforms anticipation inevitably.</comment>
