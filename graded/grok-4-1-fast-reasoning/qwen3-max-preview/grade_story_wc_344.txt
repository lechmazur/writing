<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied anticipation ("fingers... trembled not from cold but anticipation") and contradictory memories via mirrors, earning the final transformation from chaser to keeper with visible cost in apron's dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from door entry to gear alignment, landing Charged Poise closure in "rhythm poured into her... repair is not restoration, but reharmonization," with legible cost in apron's surrender and empty-handed exit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via "oaken door carved with phases... each crescent a keyhole only she could turn" and charges final image with gears "embedded in the hall’s ceiling, turning slowly"; sensory selection (crunching ice, fogging breath) mirrors priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rhythm of repair) signaled early tightens texturally via mirrors' revelations and voice's question, forcing whisper-stanced endurance; cost felt in apron's dissolution forecloses prior identity, though internal more than external pressure limits peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reharmonization emerges organically from gear constellation "map... of scars and salvaged seconds," resonating in final "keeper of quiet mendings" without moralizing; mirrors reweight past choices ambiguously yet pointedly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-limited POV stable with perceptual signature in biased noticing ("moonlight itself had been woven"); rhythmic control modulates from hush to hum, eliding mechanics purposefully to charge closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax ("boots crunching softly... each step echoing"); figurative density purposeful in lyric mode without muddle, though minor simile stacks ("like a forgotten chime," "like wind through abandoned docks") slightly thicken peak revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith mythos with time-mending gears and memory-mirrors transforms tropes; risk in lyric fantasy heightens stakes, inevitable in "every broken thing holds a song only the wounded can hear."</comment>
