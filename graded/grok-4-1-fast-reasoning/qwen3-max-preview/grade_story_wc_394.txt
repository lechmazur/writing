<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zeta's steadily curious trait and irreverent awe drive micro-choices like jamming the arrow tip and humming through cracks in voice, earning the imperfect success; contradictory reverence ("felt reverence like static") acts in scene with embodied cost at climax slump.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from arrow insertion to kaleidoscope glyphs to bell's sigh; on-page Charged Poise closure with felt cost in "voice cracked" and workshop shudder, anchored early without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Acid sea and gears constrain choices (dripping mist on landing, slapping underbelly at peak); kaleidoscope charges final image as it folds with a sigh, mirroring closure; selective sensory integration via POV bias elevates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transliterate yearning) tightens accumulatively via whirring escalation and voice-crack cost, narrowing to resonance trigger; protagonist agency in matching glyphs forces trade-off with imperfect "trembling note."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Yearning as desire-over-data emerges organically via arrow's "ancestral memory" feeding algorithm; final "bell hadn’t rung for the world... whispered for the next one" reweights premise non-literally with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mechanic's diction ("miracles powered by duct tape and spite"); rhythmic control modulates from steady curiosity to peak intensity without slippage; stable limited POV enhances intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "gears shrieked in protest" advances sound, pressure); varied rhythm propels to closure without loops or muddled metaphors; figurative language purposeful, not overwriting in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk yearning engine fed by organic relic transforms tropes; risk in absurd transliteration (arrow into slot) heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via world logic.</comment>
