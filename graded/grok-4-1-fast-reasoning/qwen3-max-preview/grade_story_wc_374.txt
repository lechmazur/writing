<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority through embodied tastes and doubt unraveling to trust; contradictory skepticism drives micro-choices like tasting lip and reaching to convergence. Man's arrival forces relational crucible, earning her surrender. Final shift from doubt to trust forecloses skepticism with felt cost in "something unfamiliar—not doubt, but trust."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with tastes/pulses building to resonant reconfiguration; orientation anchored early in bluff/aurora/ring. Single scene causality via ring's hum → taste shifts → movement → man's arrival → forest vote absorption. Closure RR (Charged Poise) lands on-page with cost in her pocketed ring and tasted earth, reweighting premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy (taste dominant, ozone/honey, loamy earth) filters through skeptic's bias, constraining choices like ten paces west to edge. Aurora evolves causally, mirroring storm spirals and dimming at closure. Lavender bluff pressures positioning; recurring aurora charges final dawn image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why weather carriers converge) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via intensifying tastes/ring pulses to realization "They’re voting on whether to absorb you." Agency in reaching convergence forecloses doubt path; cost legible in storm dissolution and her trust. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of surrendering questions to earthly convergence emerges organically from tastes, absorption, and ring stilling; no statements, just resonant images. Final "taste honey one last time" reweights premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity in healing nostalgia. Protagonist arc inextricable from theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in taste/compass sensing; voice modulates rhythm from doubt's chalk to honeyed trust. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("Why do you carry it?"), advances revelation. Rhythmic control peaks in closure's spirals/aurora cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "honey—thick, golden, impossible" advances plot/atmosphere/emotion); syntax varies for propulsion. Minor figurative density in spirals/storm but pattern-taught, no muddle at closure. No loops/artifacts; ear-test flows to "lavender swayed, already forgetting."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mycelial elections, taste-compass, weather-as-archive transforms eco-sci-fi tropes via specific sensory logic. Risky poetic voice heightens stakes without gimmickry; "terrestrially cosmic" inflects organically. Closure's absorption feels inevitable from established patterns.</comment>
