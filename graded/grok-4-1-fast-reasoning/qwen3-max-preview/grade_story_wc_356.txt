<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to cultivate serenity roots consistently in olfactory sensitivity and micro-choices like inhaling the stench amid villagers' flight, earning her realization with embodied cost. Interiority particular via scent translations into philosophy. Minor flaw: idealized without deeper contradictory impulses in pivotal bloom scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density of scents and waits to corpse flower bloom as pattern break, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure: "grief is fertilizer... wisdom flows... because of it," reweighting chaos with village transformation cost. Orientation anchored early in treetop village and greenhouse. One tightening via dream-triggered sprout suffices; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details (olfactory dominance: "wet iron and distant lightning") filter through Elira's bias, constraining bloom perception and charging final husk-replanting image. Treetop specifics (rope bridges, suspended greenhouse) guide choices like barefoot rush. No generic placeholders; economy perfect for lyric scope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (serenity in motion) signaled early, escalates accumulatively to bloom's revelatory stench narrowing options—embrace or recoil—with Elira's inhalation agency foreclosing rejection path. Village change as felt cost. One deepening via scent-truth ties internal/external; minor abstractness in "tide’s thought" softens legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of harmony in chaos emerges via scent progression and bloom image, offering non-literal answer in wilted husk and "wildflower hush." Subtext in Elira's reverence amid gagging villagers. Direct statement "In that reek, she smelled the truth..." borders articulation, slightly undercutting emergence at climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, with perceptual signature of fragrance-to-philosophy (e.g., "taste the damp moss... smell the anxiety"). Rhythmic modulation peaks at bloom unfurl. No dialogue; purposeful compression taught early, pays off in charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with metaphors integrated (vines as "question marks"), propelling via varied rhythm; read-aloud flows. Minor overwriting in bloom beat's stacked images ("velvet scream," "reek") risks muddle but coheres via pattern. No loops or scaffolds; closure image crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of olfactory herbalism, corpse flower mythos, and treetop lyricism transforms tropes into inevitable wisdom-undercurrent payoff. Risky metaphorical tide's-thought frame heightens stakes organically. No derivative echoes; bold voice commits fully.</comment>
