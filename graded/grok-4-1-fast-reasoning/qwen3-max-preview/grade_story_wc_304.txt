<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Beautician mortician's motivation rooted in decades of work and sacred spark-capture drive compels surrender-infuse choice with embodied reverence over grief; interiority concrete via patterns-memorized lattice. Contradictory impulses act in scene as hands tremble post-success yet she reveres without mourning. Final endurance/renunciation of burial earned by prior causality, foreclosing oblivion's full swallow with her fading pulse cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterns/preparation builds to Charged Poise closure where chip dims holding lucid spark, reconfiguring oblivion with reverence-cost felt in "hands trembling not with grief but reverence." Orientation anchored in first line; single scene coherent, no debt. Cost legible in exact final-image exhale honoring captured moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto's photon-pools and silence-as-presence constrain ritual choices, charge final sigh/exhale image; sensory hierarchy reflects her priorities (oil strokes sync aurora pulse). Details weave into action (chip facets fracture light on walls), mirroring internal stillness without overt symbol. Recurrent aurora veils evolve causally, tightening cadence to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture spark pre-oblivion) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative deepening in pattern-weaving to infusion success under lens; agency in surrender forecloses dissolution path. One tightening narrows options as air hesitates/scholar flutters lucidly; cost unmistakable in her pulse-fade and non-mourning trade-off charging end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of lucid stillness-before-oblivion emerges from particulars (static-patterns to chip-lantern), reweighting spark-capture without moral; final image of drifting chip/silent constellation offers non-literal resonant answer to threshold question. Subtext in gesture (step back reverent) invites ambiguity of her joining without tidy resolution. Protagonist arc inextricable from earned wisdom in "quiet yes."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single POV stable/close third with perceptual signature in pattern-noticing (hiss/static to held breath); voice texture modulates rhythmically from preparation hush to infusion pulse. Prose syntax reflects mind's lattice-weaving under surrender-stress; purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "emerald chip rested...vessel, lens, key" advances object/ stakes); rhythm varies read-aloud, paragraph cuts tighten to infusion beat. Minor figurative density in grotto descriptions pattern-taught for tone, no muddle or loops touching closure; propulsion clear sans scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of beautician-mortician infusing aurora-shard with static-patterns for stillness-lantern transforms death-ritual trope; risk in lyric Accumulative frame heightens stakes via irreplaceable sky-grotto logic. Final reconfiguration (chip sails eternally) inevitable from particulars, no derivative echoes.</comment>
