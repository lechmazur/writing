<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to understand lies' architecture drives patient micro-choices like waiting over reaching; interiority embodied in finger-brush and shadow-angle; earned shift to peace, but limited contradictory impulses flatten peak emotional layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from glint to locket CR closure; cost legible in "hindsight clarity" confirming frailty's weight; orientation anchored early in canal/radio silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Canal silt/light constrain waiting tactic and enable glint salvage; sundial shadows charge alignment beat and final coat-slip image; selective sensory hierarchy (lap of water, violet light) mirrors seeker priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode lies) deepens texturally via inscription reveal narrowing to frailty acceptance; agency in non-impulsive reach forecloses chase with felt conceptual cost; one tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Locket "Forgive me. I needed you to be perfect" reweights lies-as-shelter premise without stating moral; emergent from particulars like scratched photo; resonant ambiguity in love's frailty lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature in angle/tilt metaphors; rhythmic modulation from murmur to exhale; purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel to locket; "not to X, but to Y" cadence run (hunt/listen, chase/wait) deducts for template feel without full pattern payoff; no closure-obscuring artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh legend-seeker frame transforms truth-hunt via locket sorrow; poetic architecture motif risks bold synthesis grown from silt-shadow particulars; no template echoes.</comment>
