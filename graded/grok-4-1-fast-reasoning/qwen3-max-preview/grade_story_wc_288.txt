<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional contradictory impulses in silent mourning versus realignment; whispering coordinates to sundial earns shift from burden to sovereignty with embodied skin-flare cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density to flood crisis; Charged Poise closure in "shadow had shifted... toward genesis" reconfigures mausoleum to loom with conceptual cost of channeled resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sundial gnomon and stone hum constrain flood calibration choice; marrow-vibrating resonance and vapor-hiss charge final ozone scent image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake against erasure tightens via hum falter and self-channeling agency; rippling reflection layers cost unmistakably in climax intervention.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final "lightness of coexistence... with what might yet be" reweights isolation-to-independence thematically without moral, resonant via shadow/genesis reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature in photon-whispers and skin-shimmers holds single-POV texture; rhythmic modulation intensifies flood pressure without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax to "brass sundial gleamed"; minor figurative density in crisis (layered reflections) coherent but borders overwrite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atomically reflective skin synthesizes extinction memory into genesis loom boldly; woodpecker coordinates transform trope with irreplaceable future pivot.</comment>
