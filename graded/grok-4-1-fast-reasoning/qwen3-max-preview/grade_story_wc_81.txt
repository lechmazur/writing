<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tranquilly perceptive attribute enables concrete discoveries like the ledger's grain shipments and architectural anomalies, rooting motivation in active stillness that intensifies to the climactic stamping; micro-choices like pressing the stamp reveal hierarchy of values with embodied cost. Internal conflict emerges in dappled resolve—clarity shadowed by deliberate erasure—acting simultaneously without alternating summaries. Final verification earns a meaningful renunciation of mythic sediment, foreclosing passive acceptance with felt solidarity in the Master Index message.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (ledger, anomalies, Master Index) deepen knowledge of deliberate erasure, tightening to Conceptual Repricing at "Verified by L. Page Indexer" notation that reconfigures origins with conceptual cost of suppressed testimony. Orientation anchors immediately in silt-choked aisle and blackout; single continuous scene fits defaults with one meaningful deepening. No lens ambiguity; closure cost legible in vow-like clasp echo and warmed stamp.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sunken library's moss-slick shelves, pressurized groans, and kelp-choked skylight constrain choices (prying fused ledger, tracing vents) and charge final stair climb; sensory hierarchy (lantern flicker on watermarks, cold brass bite) reflects perceptual bias. Micro-setting via bone stylus and hollow pillars guides discoveries tactically. Final image of thinning lantern glow against deep water evolves environment causally, mirroring resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tracing origins against erasure) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern break at pristine Master Index—"we knew... They buried us"—forcing stance crystallization in stamping that forecloses mythic lies with resolve's cost. Agency in hypothesis-testing narrows options; one decisive deepening suffices. Minor abstractness in "truth rarely roared—it seeped" tempers peak pressure legibility, but final trade-off (surface to speak) charges image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reclaimed stillness emerges organically from seeping revelations and final sanctuary, offering non-literal answer to erasure via indexed testimony that reweights civic lies without moralizing. Subtext in conspirator-like volumes and inverted assumptions embraces complexity, lingering in dappled resolve. Protagonist arc inextricable from thematic question of honest origins.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (hesitant shadows as thoughts, groan as sigh) stable in close third-person POV; rhythmic modulation accelerates in discoveries, breathes in pauses. Compression taught early pays off in charged poise at clasp echo. Diction reflects serene mind under pressure, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density integrates sensory propulsion ("fingers brushing... spines," "click... echoing like a vow") with varied rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors despite lyric figuration—pattern-taught and purposeful. Paragraph cuts test passes: each advances texture or charge. Minor elevated diction fits voice without peak drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of submerged archivist in blackout era transforms trope via alternative hypothesizing and ink-stamp accountability; risk in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at preserved Index reveal. Non-obvious perceptual lens on "truth... seeped" avoids template sunken-city clichés.</comment>
