<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied ritual (pulse matching timer) and contradictory impulses (urge to open envelope held in pause); flaws from censorship rawly complicate endurance. Final renunciation of resetting timer earned with visible cost in honoring pause. Minor label-speak ("furiously tranquil") slightly genericizes peak poise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of ritual/scars builds to Charged Poise RR at timer zero ("did not reset it"), reconfiguring silence as song with conceptual cost in unopened envelope. Orientation anchored in para 1; single scene coherent. No causal breaks; closure cost legible in "honoring the question."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory, storm, timer/envelope constrain ritual choices (rattling lenses heighten inward gaze; eastern window charges final image). Sensory hierarchy (lightning flashes, thunder pulse) mirrors turmoil; POV-filtered (scars over stars). Micro-objects propel: envelope pressed to chest recharges scars motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vigil mapping scars) signaled para 1; accumulative escalation via timer cadence/storm crescendo deepens to foreclose opening ("not yet"), with agency in stillness. Cost felt in ritual's sacred tension; one tightening sufficient. Minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral punch before closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of censorship-to-self-archive emerges organically via scars/ink/silence images; final "unredacted sky" offers resonant CR reweighting without moral. Complexity in pause's ambiguity lingers; no sermonizing. Protagonist arc inextricable from cartography question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable, perceptual signature biased to poetic scars/storm (e.g., "clouds churned like ink in milk"). Rhythmic modulation heightens pressure (short sentences at timer zero); purposeful compression taught early, legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; varied rhythm passes read-aloud. Figurative coherence (storm/scars/quartz) pattern-taught, but minor overwrite density in peak beats ("lightning forked... illuminating envelope") risks muddle. No loops; clean grammar. Slight purple edges dull final image propulsion minimally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: censored poet's scar-cartography in storm observatory transforms silence trope via ritual specificity. Risky lyric poise heightens stakes; "scars... waypoints" inevitable hindsight. No derivatives; bold inward atlas reconfigures censorship organically.</comment>
