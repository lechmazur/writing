<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (rage vs. roots under stone) act in scene via mapping choices; final endurance earned by prior causality with cost of foreclosed spectacle. Interiority concrete and particular (calloused fingers on frost). No safety-hedging; flaws deepen stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases from solitary marking to contagion spread, cadence shifts to regime silence as CR closure with conceptual cost (revolution as "air they breathed"). Orientation anchored early (first paragraph). Persistent constraint of ice/viaduct shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Environment constrains choices (ice for moon paths, viaduct for alignment) and charges final image (palm on flank amid thaw). Sensory hierarchy POV-specific (magnetic hum in palms, gusts to glyphs). Details evolve causally (rails whisper lullabies).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stillness vs. haste) signaled early; textural escalation via deepening contagion narrows options to unlearn urgency, with felt cost (empires crack). Agency in remaining/mapping forces stance crystallization. One tightening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (frost ripples, viaduct lullabies); final image ("mapping [thaw] with reverence") offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting rage-to-patience arc. Complexity lingers in restrained wildness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (translating wind to glyphs, longing not land). Rhythmic control modulates intensity (short breaths synced to tide). Purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; rhythm varies (read-aloud flows). Minor paraphrase loops (silence repetitions) purposeful under textural lens but slightly dull variety in mid-section. Zero artifacts at closure; metaphors consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: roaring revolution unyoked to moon-tracked stillness feels inevitable from viaduct's reweighting. Bold risk in lyric contagion over confrontation heightens stakes. Transformation of conquest trope via patient mapping.</comment>
