<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory dual allegiance acts in scene via pity for developers despite past firm ties; final mural choice earned by prior micro-choices like camouflaged prices, foreclosing sabotage path with relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density of murals to charged poise closure in final gathering; conceptual cost legible in "privatization stalls. Not defeated—postponed," reconfiguring options without decisive defeat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Raft city's strained pontoons and eviction-notice lampposts constrain graffiti tactics; pier-visible mural charges final image, mirroring stakes through selective sensory filter (salt, neon, fried dough).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gentrification stake signaled early tightens accumulatively via individual murals to collective reorganization; agency in encoding messages forces trade-off, cost felt in hopeful desperation's postponement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. contracts emerges from phoenix kernels and weeping mermaid; final unowned-map mural offers resonant reweighting of premise without moral, embracing ambiguity of "postponed."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density integrates action-image; minor figurative muddle in "contracts slither like eels" and clown-lease jars slightly but pattern serves lyric texture without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Graffiti parables transforming eviction notices into cranes synthesize carnival anarchy uniquely; risk of lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in community hymn close.</comment>
