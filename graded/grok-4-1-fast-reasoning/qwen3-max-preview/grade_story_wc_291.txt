<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's face-blindness yields unique texture-based perception that drives micro-choices like pinning sketches and palm-over-hand contact; man's grief manifests in tremor and boot avoidance, earning his renunciation. Final sketch of him faceless confronts her flaw productively. Contradictory empathy vs. erasure impulses act in the confrontation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ribbon-to-quarry descent-to-sketches-to-breath sound-to-confession accumulate density to RR closure in mask unearthing and town empathy. Cost legible in "cold cases wouldn’t close in court" and faceless sketch. Orientation anchored by pit edge and '89 collapse in first graph; single scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mist coiling ankles and limestone chill constrain descent and pinning, mirroring internal void; texture hierarchy (silk decay, grit) via POV bias charges portraits' flicker. Quarry evolution from throat to foreman office tracks spatially. Final masks in glass cases reconfigure setting's erasure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken empathy) signaled in ribbon relic and sketches; man's emergence tightens via lens density, forcing hand-touch agency that forecloses accusation path. Cost in his open weeping and her acceptance of no-bodies closure. Moral calculus between justice abstraction and textured memory viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Texture vs. face absence emerges organically from sketches-without-eyes and killer's "kept their faces"; final faceless sketch of him reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in ribbon's silver veins and thumb-caress implies mourning's duality. Counter-reading (hoarding as love) lingers authentically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "texture doesn’t lie" filters all; voice modulates from hushed description to ragged breath tension. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("You kept their masks") pursues empathy goal. Stable third-limited POV with no leakage; rhythm compresses at emergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density: "mist coiling around her ankles like guilt made visible" does triple duty (sensory/atmospheric/character). Rhythms vary (short punchy emergence beats vs. flowing setup); no loops or scaffolds. Figurative pattern taught early (stages/performance) pays off without muddle in peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Face-blind detective via texture transforms cold-case trope; opposites-unifying method (glitter/quarry) yields fresh empathy awakening over justice. Risky faceless portraits as trap heightens stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight in man's thumb-caress echoing her palm moment.</comment>
