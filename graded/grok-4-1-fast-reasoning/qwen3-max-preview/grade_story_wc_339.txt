<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's analytic trait drives contradictory impulses—dissecting grief "like equations" vs. eventual surrender—earning the climactic release of sister's name with embodied cost ("hollow and humming"). Interiority concrete via globe interactions syncing to pulse and whispers. Minor diagnostic phrasing ("recalibration") doesn't flatten pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns in globe build density to CR closure where globe unmade ("thread snapped") reweights premise with cost (warm wind post-hollowing). Orientation anchored early via Earhart's plane. One tightening via realization of receiver suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Snow globe as micro-setting constrains choices (tilts, whispers) and charges final image (helix to thread). Sensory details POV-filtered (counterclockwise spin during perigee). Cliffside evolves to mirror release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (physics of letting go) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via syncing blizzard/pulse and sleep deprivation to agency-driven release (opens palms). Cost legible in "hollow and humming" post-unmaking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of release as "mass converting to light" emerges organically from globe patterns and Earhart parallel, resonant in final vanishing without statement. Protagonist arc inextricable from surrender.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct analytic-perceptual signature ("dissected grief like equations") modulates with intensity; stable first-person with purposeful poetic compression taught early. No elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: vivid images like "snowflake detaching... dissolving into my skin" advance closure without loops or muddle. Rhythms vary purposefully; no artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Snow globe as emotional-resonance receiver synthesizes Earhart myth, grief physics, and transcendence boldly; risky conceptual premise follows implications to charged CR without retreat.</comment>
