<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (trembling vs. duty) culminate in earned sly rebellion; final micro-choice to recalibrate logs reveals value hierarchy with cost of overseer judgment. Minor slip in overt diagnostic phrasing like "encrypted compassion" borders label-speak without full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density buildup from glue to humming revelation; orientation anchored early in amphitheater; CR closure in "slyest, most heartfelt victory" reconfigures mercy in systems with sly cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices via acoustics for humming and chain snag on carving; amphitheater warmth seeps into palms, charging discovery beat; recurring "building's breath" mirrors internal sync and final volcano exhale.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of mercy vs. control deepens texturally through chain measurement and inscription reveal, narrowing to sly implementation; agency in humming forces trade-off with "madness" risk felt in overseer doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of compassion in rigid systems emerges organically from glyph erosion to gear "soul"; final "world would never know it was mercy" offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting prior floods/famine tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature fuses mechanical-mystical (chain as "tuning fork against grief"); stable close third-person modulates rhythm with pressure, peaking in hum's resonance; purposeful poetic compression legible under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., chain unspools "to map sorrow"); figurative density in peak hum beat borders overwrite (−0.4) but pattern-taught; minor loops in "trembled" repetition and synonym empathy phrasing dull propulsion slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glue forensics to harmonic flood mercy transforms engineering tropes; volcano amphitheater frame risks bold lyricism that heightens stakes via sly dissonance payoff.</comment>
