<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation to prove reciprocity roots in ritual polishing and intensifies to earned refusal of intern; contradictory impulses (hidden fear via indifference) act in marble-mending memory, compelling stasis with isolation cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from polishing to intern pressure to garden response; Charged Poise closure via fireflies mirroring marbles reconfigures partnership with conceptual cost to metrics isolation, fully on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Garden maze's wild vines constrain compliance refusal and evolve to supply firefly spirals charging closure; selective sensory pulses and rustles mirror internal rebellion under POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake vs metrics tightens accumulatively through intern demand narrowing options; agency in petal tuck and refusal forecloses path with felt relational cost, legible in retreating footsteps and vine curl.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden's reciprocal commemoration reweights reciprocity theme non-literally via marble-mirroring fireflies; emerges organically from cracked testimony without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with garden-sentient perceptual signature; rhythmic syntax modulates ritual poise to terse intern defiance, dialogue subtext sharp in "consents only to those who listen."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds, high density integrates metaphors like "vein of gold" purposefully; varied rhythm propels to glowing marbles without figurative muddle in peak garden response.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh quantifiable-luck world transforms garden trope via ritual marbles vs bands; risk in lyric reciprocity payoff via firefly spirals heightens stakes organically.</comment>
