<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Embodied curse of mnemonic gifting hoarding memories like tombstones drives motivation and internal conflict; final release earned through prior suppression buildup. Minor tidiness in father's softening tear slightly dulls cost legibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from descent to visualization, culminating in lock snap and portrait release as Resonant Reconfiguration. Cost legible in "no longer ... victim, but sovereign" after years corked.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cave's pulsing indigo walls constrain visualization and drawing, charging final dimming to warm glow; tears sizzling on crystal ground mirrors internal uncorking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uncorking tightens via portrait emergence and lock resonance, forcing release with agency in whisper and drawing; cost felt in sizzling tears and lingering father's face.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Imprisonment/release theme emerges organically through lock/cave/creativity parallels, answered non-literally by winged portraits dissolving; reweights suppression without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable limited third-person with artistic perceptual signature in "graphite into soul-deep contours"; rhythmic control modulates from sorrowful hush to dawn warmth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figuratives like "flood rise" propels without loops; varied syntax breathes with emotional beats, no artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mnemonic artist and resonant cave transforms creative block trope; lock revealing charcoal nub risks bold metaphorical payoff in sovereign ascent.</comment>
