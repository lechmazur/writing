<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Earned internal shift at closure—"permission to be remade"—roots in embodied regrets brushing ribs, with micro-choice not to chase ghost in rearview revealing values hierarchy. Contradictory impulses in playing louder despite knowledge. Minor slip: abstract "pixelated amnesty" edges toward diagnostic label-speak without full embodiment early.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of motifs (flake, flutters) builds to Charged Poise closure in glass shattering into "a thousand glimmering shards—each one a forgiven moment," with conceptual cost of fragmentation legible in final step forward. Orientation anchored by ~50 words. No lens ambiguity or causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (pullout, violin case) constrains choices—flutters tied to clasp map soul coordinates—and charges final image as mountain "exhales" in time with fiddle. Sensory hierarchy (ozone smell, mist through pine) POV-filtered via fiddler's observance. No white-room; evolves causally with mist/play.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sculpt from "never") signaled early, tightens via lens-deepening as flake image clarifies during play, narrowing to self-amnesty with cost of "cracked, fragmented" beginning. Agency in sustained playing forces realization. Visible price: foreclosed chase, honored roads not taken.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented forgiveness emerges organically via flake shift and flutters dancing with "remembered laughter," reweighting "never" in final image without statement. Resonant non-literal answer: disbelief "shimmer[ing] like dawn on wet stone." No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in allowance vs. absolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual signature—"silence pooled around him, thick as resin"—modulates rhythm with intensity (short sentences in play beat). Stable single POV, no leakage; diction biased to fiddler's observant idiom. Experimental compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: lines multi-job (e.g., "notes spiraling upward, threading through the scaffold flutters"). Rhythm varies, read-aloud natural. Minor deduction for figurative density ("mist like smoke through pine needles") persisting in peak play without tighter pattern payoff, but no loops or muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wet-plate relic, soul-map flutters, pixelated amnesty transforms forgiveness trope into irreplaceable conceptual frame. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes via motif accumulation to CR closure. No derivative echoes; bold, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
