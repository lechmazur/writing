<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction in "not for vengeance, but for cartography," embodied in geode-whispered names and brittle smile; final pursuit earned by grief-calibrated micro-choices without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in "observatory leapt... chasing ghosts," cost legible in "bleak certainty"; orientation anchored early, no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory's circuit breakers and zero-g constrain timing/actions; geode/blister as micro-settings charge final flare, sensory hierarchy trauma-tuned (Earth "wound turning").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hunt potential) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via collapsing sims to Pacific coords; agency in slotting geode/initiate yields felt cost in fractured exhilaration, minor abstraction limits peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of salvaged potential emerges organically from sim residuals/geode pulses; final "geode flared—one pulse, synchronized" offers resonant CR reweighting catastrophe without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature ("trauma-tuned nerves"); rhythmic modulation peaks in "stars bent... hollows between seconds," purposeful poetic compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax/rhythm propels to closure; metaphors consistent (violet filaments, spilled mercury), no loops/artifacts, read-aloud ear excels in thruster ignition beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone geode/perturbation cartography transforms sci-fi tropes; risk in "unused potential pools" premise heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight via sim echoes.</comment>
