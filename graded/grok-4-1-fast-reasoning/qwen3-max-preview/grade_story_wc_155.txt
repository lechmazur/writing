<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority concrete and particular, with embodied contradiction between buried joy and technique-driven acclaim culminating in earned laughter at projection success; micro-choices like visiting elders reveal values hierarchy; final rediscovery renunciation forecloses prior path with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from fog-shrouded setup through memory shards to CR closure in twilight image reweighting premise of ruin to reverence; orientation anchored in first paragraph; persistent fog constraint shapes tactics and final charged poise with undeniable emotional cost legible in "warmth lingered, and so did the laughter."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fog and orchard constrain projection tactics (as emulsion) and charge final image of sighing approval; sensory hierarchy (light piercing fog, moss braille) reflects artist's perceptual bias; spatial choreography coherent across courtyard setup.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rediscovering joy via resonant display signaled early, texturally escalates through elder visits to noon climax narrowing options to light scaffold success; agency in arrangement forces emotional trade-off crystallized in laughter; cost felt in released "unguarded delight" charging ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of release over capture emerges from light-painting particulars, reweighted in final image of fragment as key without moralizing; resonance inextricable from arc, lingering ambiguity in "joys... only the heart could see."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in photon-bending diction and rhythmic lyricism modulates with intensity; stable single POV with artist bias; purposeful compression in memory shards legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "bending photons... impossible color" advances voice/setting/action); varied rhythm flows read-aloud; figurative layering taught early as light motif without muddle in peak projection beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of optics, fog-emulsion film, and ancestral knowledge transforms ruin trope into reverent rediscovery; risk in lyric accumulation heightens emotional stakes; irreplaceable premise inflections inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
