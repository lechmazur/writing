<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation as gardener of second chances intensifies compellingly to higher-stakes escalation, rooted in consistent traits; interiority particular via sensory tremors. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal escalation beat ("She’d escalate"), leaning resolute without embodied conflict. Micro-choices like placing grotto reveal values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images builds from library hush to town-wide arbors, culminating in CR closure ("The forest of second thoughts was growing") with conceptual cost of subtle subversion spreading. Orientation anchored early in cobalt library. One tightening via midnight placement narrows to witnessed impact; no ambiguity at end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt library in mist vividly selective, sensory hierarchy (tremors, hum, mist ankles) reflects Elira's perceptual bias; recurring grotto as micro-setting constrains choices and charges final image ("mist that now shimmered faintly cobalt"). Environmental details evolve causally with thrum outward, mirroring internal resolve without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (humble rebellion via grotto/displays) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through annex test to town synchronization, forcing trade-off of no permits vs impact; agency in alignment/placement forecloses overt paths. Cost legible in "subversion by stillness" and quiet risks, charging final arbors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of quiet recalibration emerges organically from pawn-to-queen shifts and arbor inscriptions, reweighted non-literally in final "cradling...a possibility" without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like Milo's whisper avoids platitudes; ambiguity in "witnesses" invites reflection with counter-readings of eccentricity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual signature (unspoken tremors, sighs of epics), rhythmic modulation with intensity; single POV stable, no head-hopping. Prose texture controlled, diction character-specific (chess algebraic notations on leaves); purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "grotto hummed louder...ache of children" advances stakes/atmosphere); rhythm varies read-aloud. Overwriting via pervasive figurative language ("weeping condensation," "roots curling...gentle interrogations") in escalation beats dulls propulsion slightly (-0.4), but pattern coherent without muddle or loops at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess coach wielding magnetic grotto for bioluminescent second thoughts transforms tropes of quiet revolution; risk in magical realism (pawn sprouts sapling) heightens stakes organically. Non-obvious angle on rebellion via windows/arbors inevitable in hindsight, no derivatives.</comment>
