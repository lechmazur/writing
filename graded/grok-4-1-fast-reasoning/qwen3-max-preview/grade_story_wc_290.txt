<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in hesitation at narrow passage ("stone scraping her shoulders") compel earned change when phobia lifts post-embodiment, with compass drop as visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from organ sound to chamber discovery; CR closure lands when "the key dissolved into her," reweighting premise with undeniable internal reconfiguration cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains via tightening passage pressuring descent choice; chamber's "stars that moved independently" charges final image of liberated space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Phobia stake signaled early escalates accumulatively through organ pull and self-pointing compass, forcing embodiment agency with felt emotional cost in widened passage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of liberation emerges organically; final "humming the organ’s melody, her steps light" offers resonant CR reweighting mutiny without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (geometric focus, e.g., "harmonic cipher") stable in single close-POV; rhythm modulates from tense to expansive without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in "dust motes that danced like forgotten spirits" slightly muddles peak entry without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny premise synthesizes fresh geometric rebellion, transformed through organ-key realization; risk in abstract embodiment pays off inevitably at CR.</comment>
