<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Embodied interiority peaks in "vibrating at the frequency where rage and peace fuse into purpose"; micro-choices like barefoot walk reveal values; final laugh roots as earned stasis with inheritance reconfigured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds from cap touch to spiral press; on-page RR closure via globes bursting moments; cost legible in "honoring what was lost enough to let it return differently."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ice cracks as "seams of release" constrain walk and charge dais climax; atrium evolves causally to pollen-thick air, mirroring release; starlight pools on petals in final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens accumulatively via time stutter and resonant tone; agency in whispering names forces consent over force; cost unmistakable in exhalation dissolving eggshell.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of tender entropy decrease emerges via seed names stitching seams; sapling leaf as "porous, alive, humming with second chances" resonantly reweights borrowed time without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with synesthetic signature ("scent of loam, a child’s laughter swallowed by snow"); rhythmic control in "globes burst—not with violence, but grace."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffolds; high density in "ice began to weep. Not melt—weep."; varied rhythm propels to closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mundane acorn cap as paradox key transforms entropy trope organically; lyric risk of upward-weeping globes heightens stakes to sapling Charged Poise.</comment>
