<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Potter's zen traits root motivation in concrete micro-choices like pouring water for the bee, embodying kindness under subtle pressure; interiority particular via marrow-thrum sensations. Minimal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously prevent 9+; serenity dominates without shown friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with image density building to CR closure: "Let the vessel stay soft, porous, breathing" reconfigures resistance as surrender, legible cost in foreclosed firing and porous endurance. Single scene coherent, orientation anchored early in potter-oasis setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hives as "broken cathedrals" and sagging frames constrain alignment of glass on hive stand and clay sourcing, charging final pot-in-dust image. Sensory selection (iridescent wings, amber ripples) POV-biased to zen priorities, vivid without stall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding resistance) deepens texturally via thrum escalation from pulse to sync/lullaby, narrowing to pot-not-fired renunciation; agency in molding/cradling forecloses stasis with felt porosity cost. One tightening sufficient under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of surrender-as-preservation emerges organically from bee-drinking and unfired pot, final "fractures heal not by sealing, but by letting light through" reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual signature ("palimpsest of summers stacked like honeycomb"), rhythm modulates from relentless heat to tender hum; stable single POV, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fingers tracing the rim of a cracked kiln" advances setting/action/atmosphere); figurative consistent in lyric pattern without muddle, varied rhythm passes ear test. Minor density thickness in opening images nudges from 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-glass phototropism and beekeeping stasis transforms tropes; risk in lyric time-curl payoff feels inevitable, heightening resonance without gimmick.</comment>
