<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied interiority and contradictory impulses (e.g., "fear was a luxury" vs. gasping recognition of unlived life); final absorption of her own fragment earns change with visible cost on the chest-dissolving beat. No unearned epiphanies or stock phrasing; motivation intensifies holistically through releases.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-taught bottle releases tightening density to personal climax; on-page Charged Poise closure ("stood, empty-handed, radiant") reconfigures with legible emotional cost in heavier heart and final trail spelling "HERE. NOW. YOU."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Black sand and volcano constrain choices (bug burrows, rumble purrs affectionately) and charge final gleaming beach image; sensory selection (absorbs moonlight, velvet stage) mirrors transformation without overt symbolism. POV bias sharpens to her barefoot sinking and mist ankles.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding transformation) signaled early, escalates texturally via deepening releases culminating in fourth-bug internalization narrowing to personal cost; chain effects (fisherman, librarian) complicate without resolving. One decisive tightening sufficient, charges closure poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief-to-grace emerges organically from bug fragments and releases, resonant non-literal answer in final "HERE. NOW. YOU." trail reweighting unlived lives without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in accidental fulfillment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct poetic texture (e.g., "time like taffy," "stars... schools of silver fish") with rhythmic modulation under rising density; stable third-limited POV, perceptual signature biased to whispers and pulses, no leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm and propulsion; figurative coherence (e.g., bugs pulsing with celestials) taught early without muddle in peak releases. Minor density in metaphors contained, no loops or scaffolds dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of unlived-life bugs and accidental orchestration transforms tropes into inevitable lyric arc; bold risk in textural hush and volcano purr heightens stakes, closure radiant smile feels earned and singular.</comment>
