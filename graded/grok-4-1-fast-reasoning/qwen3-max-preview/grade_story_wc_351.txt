<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in colliding memories, with micro-choices like pressing palm revealing values; minor diagnostic slips in "synaptic plasticity" phrasing slightly abstract conflicting impulses. Final modification earned through prior entanglement without tidy resolution. No safety-hedging in flaws like buried promotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase to Charged Poise closure; orientation anchored early via kneeling in canyon. Single scene fits defaults; cost legible in "eyes wet but unblinking" as felt price of rewiring. No causality breaks, pattern taught via memory collision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon and mirror constrain choices (tracing, angling) and charge final image (pocket vibration); sensory hierarchy (binary hoots syncing pulse) reflects POV bias. Subtle mirroring of internals via "canyon’s throat" without overt symbolism. Evolving details like dimming moon heighten specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (modify dreams) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via memory flood forcing neural recalibration; agency in "focused will" forecloses mourning path. Escalation coheres under lens with one decisive layering; cost visible in alchemized submarine thesis fusion charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of alchemizing loss emerges organically from particulars like periscope/child's toy; final "museum of salvaged dreams" offers non-literal resonant answer reweighting premise. Lingering ambiguity in resurrection's cost avoids tidy moral. No thematic echo or moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in synaptic/canyon metaphors; stable third-limited with biased noticing (ridge as dendrite). Lyrical rhythm modulates with intensity, from trembling to "pebbles tumbling" laugh. No head-hopping or withholding; elision purposeful in memory entanglement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines; rhythm varies (short laugh sentence amid long reflectives). Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors like "ghosts in a prism" during peak memory beat dulls slightly without obscuring closure. Zero loops; strong verbs propel to final shimmer.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neural cartography and dream archaeology transforms introspection trope; "chaotically precise" mind navigates fractures originally. Risky lyric voice heightens stakes without gimmick; inevitable hindsight in mirror's pulse from relic to palimpsest.</comment>
