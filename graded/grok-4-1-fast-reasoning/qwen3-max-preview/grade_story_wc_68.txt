<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Concrete interiority shines in pacing cracks as fault lines and spitting at chants, rooting rationally rebellious traits; lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal on-page moment like the tower climb, leaning toward declarative endurance over micro-conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from daily rituals to tower Charged Poise, reconfiguring endurance vs. erasure; closure costs legible in "abrasive calm... grain by grain" settling truth over lies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sewer as "inverted archive" and sedimentary mosaics filter through POV bias, constraining mapping choices; submerged sundial shadows charge final image, mirroring internal persistence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preservation vs. amnesia signaled early accumulates density to tower reversal (coordinates into wind) and final contrast; cost felt in solitary geological rebellion foreclosing reintegration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Competing narratives emerge implicitly from silt-etched rebuttals and final sundial transcription vs. obelisk; resonant non-literal answer in shadows moving "even underwater, even forgotten" reweights premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in erosion/time as "patience of stone"; rhythmic control modulates with pressure, envoy dialogue subtextual and goal-driven without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels accumulatively; minor figurative density in high-pressure tower beat ("wind didn’t answer... water shifted") nears overwrite but supports geological poise without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-plague sewer philosopher mapping narratives geologically transforms preservation trope; cog as "methodology incarnate" and quiet rebellion risk heightens stakes organically.</comment>
