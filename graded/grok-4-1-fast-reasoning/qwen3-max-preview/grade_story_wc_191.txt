<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Character motivation clear and intensifies through timed quest; wisely adventurous trait shown in micro-choices like counting paces without rush. Interiority concrete but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in pivotal descent beat; change earned via throne choice with felt cost of orchard's collapse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: flake hum → murals → coordinates → hatch → throne DC/CR. Orientation anchored early in orchard; closure lands on-page when she emerges pre-sunrise with timeline reconfiguration and orchard erasure as undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting vivid and selective, with murals constraining peel action and willow droplets pressuring timed descent. Futuristic elements like nano-filaments and memory-steps filter through lore keeper's priorities; recurring flake recharges final emergence image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stairway before sunrise) signaled early, escalates causally via trembling steps and eddies narrowing options. Agency in peel/count/sit drives tightening; cost legible in fraying reality forcing quickened pace and orchard loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom-adventure synthesis emerges from particulars like memory-steps and throne perspective, without statement. Final image of dull flake and vanished orchard offers non-literal resonant answer, reweighting premise with comprehension cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., moss whispering names); voice modulates rhythmically from mist-laced calm to descent urgency. Purposeful poetic compression taught early, legible at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., flake flare projecting coordinates advances plot/atmosphere); rhythm varies for propulsion, no loops or scaffolds. Figurative density purposeful and pattern-taught in lyric mode, but minor muddle in "fractured glass across time" slightly dulls peak immersion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fantasy quest where throne grants perspective over power, transforming tropes via memory-solidified stairs. Bold risk in temporal ascent/rewrite feels inevitable from flake resonance pattern; no derivative echoes.</comment>
