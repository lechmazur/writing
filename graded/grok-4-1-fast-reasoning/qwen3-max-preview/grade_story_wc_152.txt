<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in disguising wisdom as foolishness, compelling higher-stakes stitching under coup pressure; final endurance earned via prior flame-sync choices with isolation cost. Interiority particular through needle/flame embodiment, no epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from flame's subtle dance to violent shudder inciting perceptual step and counter-stitching; RR closure in flame steadying as possibilities collapse, cost legible in her perceptual gasp and sabotage risk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt observatory and eternal flame constrain choices (e.g., flame's tremor guides crimson stitch) and charge final image of steady flame beside loom; autumn leaves scraping walls mirror rising tension purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thwarting coup) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via flame shudder deepening knowledge/options; agency in perceptual sync forecloses paths with on-page gasp/cost, charging final collapse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of quiet wisdom emerges organically from thread/flame particulars; final "wisdom need not shout" image resonantly reweights disguise motif without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stable limited POV with perceptual signature in thread/star diction; rhythmic prose modulates intensity (short sentences in flame shudder), purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion (e.g., "needle flashing like a comet’s tail" integrates action/voice); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; figurative density purposeful in peak flame-tremor beat, paying off without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroidery/reality-sync transforms conspiracy trope; risk-taking in perceptual stepping heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight via flame-thread logic.</comment>
