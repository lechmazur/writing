<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's shift from manifests/margins to purpose-driven deliveries shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, earned by the envelope's tug; final cautious exuberance forecloses profit life with felt cost of fragile joy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as envelope pattern density increases to cycle return ("new envelope waiting"), landing CR closure in final harbor rhythm image with conceptual cost of reordered economy; orientation anchored early in library under stars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Harbor details like "mop bucket," "coil of hemp," "lantern’s warm glass" constrain hidden deliveries and charge recipients' wonder; final "laughter drifting from the docks" mirrors internal shift via sensory evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of uplifting silent contributors tightens via cycle return ("five more envelopes"), forcing silent endurance with agency in hand-deliveries; cost legible in "cautious exuberance—the kind that fears its own joy might shatter."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cycles of compassion emerges from envelope chain to harbor changes (crates with drawings, embroidered nets), resonant final image of "compassion cycling onward, wave after wave" reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature ("tides in teacups," "constellations blinked like distant signal lamps"); rhythmic diction modulates from whimsical observation to charged poise, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors (tides/seasons cycles) integrated into action; varied rhythm propels via short observational beats, minor figurative density in openings doesn't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh circular premise transforms pay-it-forward trope via anonymous harbor workers and locket memory; risk of multi-shard cycle heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from mistaken envelope.</comment>
