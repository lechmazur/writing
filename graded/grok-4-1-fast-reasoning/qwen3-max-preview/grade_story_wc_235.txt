<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with contradictory jealousy embodied as a "blade on stone" sharpening focus, compelling the writing choice that earns the final reconfiguration; past selves reveal flaws complicating choices without safety-hedging. Final renunciation of clean endings feels character-particular and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dream-shard density builds to scroll-filling CR closure, with legible cost in the grave shrinking to "footnote" via ink-distillation; orientation anchored in opening lines, pattern taught early without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Birch scroll as micro-setting constrains pivotal writing choice (repels then accepts ink) and charges final "hums against my thigh" image; sensory details like "wind scrapes branches like quills" filter through POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to distill chaos signaled early tightens via jealousy-fueled hunting of selves, reweighting options under accumulative lens; agency in chasing/writing forecloses feral evasion with legible cost in "ragged but resilient" seams.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of nostalgia's alchemy emerges organically from scroll's darkening script and final soaring "through," offering non-literal reconfiguration of chaos without moralizing; resonant from particulars like rotting cake and dream-deer sinew.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in jaded lyricism ("feral nostalgia... rabid, snarling") modulates rhythm with pressure, stable first-person focalization; purposeful compression of dream-shards legible under taught accumulative pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax propels via images like "ink flows—thick, black, hungry"; no loops or artifacts, figurative layering purposeful without muddle in peak writing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-chronicler hunting past selves on untamable scroll transforms nostalgia trope; risky lyric shards heighten stakes, inevitable in hindsight via jealousy-to-cartography arc.</comment>
