<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—calm under rising anchor pressure—act in scene, earning the final repair release with visible endurance cost; blindness flaw drives tactile expertise without safety-hedging. Interiority concrete via "tremor of a gear’s hesitation"; micro-choices like whispering stories reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from diagnostic feel to recalibration, culminating in Charged Poise closure as drone flies amid ship's horn, reconfiguring chaos to harmony with felt deadline cost in "anchor’s groan grew louder... She didn’t rush."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rail depot vibrations and basin/prism constrain repair choices, charging final image of rails/tide; sensory hierarchy blind-POV biased to tremors/echoes integrates purposefully without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchids' pollination pre-voyage) signaled early, tightens via anchor rhythm under Accumulative lens, forcing calm endurance agency; cost legible in deadline vibrations syncing with gyros.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mending fractures emerges organically, final image of drone/orchids/ship reweighting premise without moral: "She mended trajectories. She turned fractures into flight paths."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Blind POV perceptual signature (tactile/auditory bias) stable, rhythmic prose modulates intensity; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in closure harmony without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts; minor figurative density ("iron bones slick with dew") purposeful but risks slight overwrites in opening, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh blind refraction repair synthesizes rail/sea stakes organically, risk-taking calm transforms artisan trope; irreplaceable hummingbird pollination voyage link inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
