<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority through embodied gestures like fingers brushing the crumbling archway, revealing character via contradictory impulses of gentle patience and defiant seeding; uncloaking earns a meaningful renunciation with felt cost of shedding unseen armor. Minor slip in occasional abstract phrasing like "grammar of absolution" borders unearned epiphany but doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from offering to gardening to listening, culminating in Charged Poise RR at "She smiles. Not because she’s found answers, but because she’s remembered how to ask," with legible conceptual cost of endured loss reconfigured into quiet permission. Orientation anchored early in courtyard; single scene coherent, no shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (seeds into "cracks between flagstones, beneath rosebush roots") and charges final image (soil from knees in courtyard under first star); sensory details like "moss muffles footsteps" and "damp soil and possibility" filter through POV bias toward dissolve. Vivid, purposeful integration mirrors creeping loss without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of seeking sacred amid normality signaled early, tightens via accumulative deepening in uncloak-to-gardening sequence narrowing to refusal of erasure; cost felt in untouched bread and lingering offerings. One meaningful cadence shift suffices under lens, charging poise without reversal requirement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sacred in ordinary emerges organically from particulars like stale bread and seeds, reweighted in final image of dripping spring and unnamed star as non-literal answer to forgetting; ambiguity lingers in "tenuous absolution" without moralizing. Resonance ties to protagonist's arc without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "truth hides not in spectacle but in the slow dissolve"); rhythmic control modulates from gentle to defiant, purposeful lyric compression taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax and rhythm suiting lyric mode; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors despite poetic density—e.g., "ivy" and "spider silk" integrate cleanly. Minor repetitive "she" openings don't obscure closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "creeping normality" into guerrilla gardening and uncloaking in ruins transforms loss tropes; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes of erasure, inevitable in hindsight via seed motif constraining defiance.</comment>
