<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—walk away for dignity vs. stay for animals—act simultaneously in the reconstruction ritual, earning her final renunciation with visible cost in planned testimony and smaller sanctuary. Interiority concrete via embodied hands-on work and animal memories. Flawless under single-POV defaults; no safety-hedging in moral ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from tail discovery to ritual to glass-case closure (Charged Poise/CR), reweighting convictions with cost of shedding illusions. Single scene oriented by ~50 words; one tightening via reconstruction deepens stake. Cost legible in "resignation—but also a detailed care-plan."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Misty workshop, lantern, brazier constrain reconstruction choices; tail tip as micro-setting charges final image in glass case beside cot. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased (iridescent scales, embers pulsing); evolves with mist thickening. Workshop clutter mirrors internal chaos, integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-respect vs. compassion) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via ritual that forecloses naive trust, forcing trade-off in resignation/testimony with felt risk cost. Agency in micro-choices narrows options; moral calculus sharpens peak. Escalation coherent under lens, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tail reconstruction offers resonant non-literal answer to fragile convictions, reweighting premise via shedding metaphor without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from particulars (scales aligned, pigments mixed); ambiguity lingers in imperfect regrowth. Final image fuses arc and question seamlessly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (scaled lives, dawn feedings) stable in single close-POV; rhythm modulates from mist-curling opening to starlight balm. Syntax reflects introspective state under ritual pressure; no elision or head-hopping. Diction controlled, purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion; metaphors consistent (mist swallowing tree line, tail gradient) without muddle, pattern-taught via chameleon motif. Varied rhythm passes ear test; minor overwriting in reflections ("shimmering stillness") doesn't dull closure image. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sanctuary con via chameleon tail reconstruction transforms ethical dilemma into shedding ritual, risking bold lyricism without gimmickry. Non-obvious angle on betrayal honors survival over redemption; inevitable in hindsight from early metaphor.</comment>
