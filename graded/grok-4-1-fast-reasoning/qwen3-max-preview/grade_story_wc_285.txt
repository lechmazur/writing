<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Coachman's contradictory impulses—endure alone vs. aid passenger—act simultaneously through attuned inaction until the needle offer, earning the closure choice with visible cost in his marrow-deep serenity; passenger's resolve inferred flawlessly via gloved cough and unspoken burden. Interiority concrete via bone-roots and pocket-tremble. BRR met with anchored interleaving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (fog whisper, axle creak, gutter tick) tightens to pattern break (ticking silence, fog parting), yielding Charged Poise closure at needle exchange and far-bank threshold with felt endurance cost; oriented by ~50 words (coachman, fog-bound crossing, predawn).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>River crossing constrains navigation via submerged stones and ticking clock, charging final image; sensory hierarchy (hooves/rain over sight in fog) reflects coachman's attuned bias. Willows/gutters recur tactilely, mirroring internal layers. Micro-setting (needle, ribbon) integrates perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unstitch palimpsest layers to distill essence) signaled in opening promise, deepens via passenger stir and needle resonance under textural lens, narrowing to agency in offer; cost legible in "spindrift serenity" settling post-crossing, foreclosing isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of refining sorrow emerges organically via needle/palimpsest imagery shifting from personal loss ("wife’s laughter vanished") to shared invitation; final image ("road climbed toward dawn") reconfigures promise non-literally with lingering ambiguity of endless rides.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV, perceptual signature via syncopated breaths and "bones had grown roots"; syntax/rhythm modulate from fog-dance flow to crisp "She nodded," heightening needle beat without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion peaks in "drip-tick... low chant," varying lengths breathe with tension; metaphors cohere (seams/percolate/distill) without muddle, high density minus loops, though minor synonym echo ("whispered"/"hummed") nicks peak fog-thickening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Yarn needle transforms seamstress tool to memory blade organically, fresh synthesis of coachman philosopher with lyric fog-rhythm risking poetic density yet charging closure; no template echoes.</comment>
