<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines in embodied contradictions like "lilac unease settling into her bones," with micro-choices (altering the swirl) revealing values under whisper pressure; socially perceptive trait enables resonance without labels; final recognition earned via prior felt weights/textures, no unmotivated epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from spirals to thrum/whispers syncing into tone; closure as CR in tile cracking and "emergent hush wasn’t absence—it was potential," with conceptual cost of rearranged mess legible on page; orientation anchored early in grotto, single-shard core with clean post-grotto transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto micro-setting constrains via "damp sand" for mandala and "emergent hush" absorbing sound; mist/body integrate tactilely ("clinging like second skin"), charging tile placement/climax; sensory hierarchy (wet limestone, moss) mirrors internal shift without catalog, evolving causally as air grows "viscous."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning in mess) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via whispers' harmonization forcing interjection/stance; agency in finger-swirl alteration narrows to recognition, cost in tile fracture and foreclosed chaos-solving visible; no abstract stakes, pressure coheres under lens to charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of patterned meaning emerges organically from mandala response and "mess wasn’t chaos to be solved," reweighted in rain-rivulets final image without moralizing; subtext in voices' textures layers complexity; resonance from particulars like off-key musician's "yearning beneath," inviting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual signature ("grains like iron filings," "viscous with withheld confession"); POV stable/single, rhythmic modulation peaks at "whispers synchronized"; purposeful compression taught early pays off in closure tone, no distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "thrum pulsed...rearranging grains"); figurative coherence (mist/breath, hush/potential) pattern-taught, no muddle in peak whispers; varied rhythm/read-aloud propulsion, minor density slip in opening metaphors doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chalk artist/mandala/tile flake transforms silence trope into interactive resonance; risk in lyric hush-build heightens stakes, inevitable hindsight via "silence...waiting to be shaped"; no derivative echoes, bold conceptual integrity.</comment>
