<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mage's earnestly naive patience and lukewarm aura drive concrete micro-choices like timing drips and breathing with drops, earning the quiet contentment at the end. Internal consistency shines in embodied details like chilled bare feet contrasting his tepid nature. No second character, but single-POV interiority reveals flaws like naivety constraining magical shortcuts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from months of observation to resin pour and bell drop, with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the fish's breach reconfigures cosmic balance with fragile cost legible in "however temporary, however fragile." Single scene anchored early (viaduct, dawn, post-last-fish). No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct's dew-slick stone and dripping arches constrain the rebuild, shaping resin via recorded rates; dawn light dictates tone rhythm. Sensory selectivity (plink of drops, brine echo) filters through mage's observational bias. Final sea stir charges image, with body/tools as micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cosmic balance) signaled early, escalates via Accumulative cadence shift: hesitant plink to syncopated rhythm narrows options, forcing patient agency. Tightening in resin setting "with a sigh" forecloses failure path; fish confirms with undeniable fragile cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Brittle devotion emerges organically from patient rebuild vs. power tropes, resonating in final fish arc as non-literal answer to imbalance—reweights premise without moralizing. Particulars like parchment equations and viaduct maps ground theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature (drip syllables, basin counters) modulates rhythmically, stable single-POV distance apt for Accumulative lyricism. No dialogue; prose texture reflects mage's methodical mind without elision or drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density (equations curling like vines) propels via varied syntax/rhythm; no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Peak rebuild beat clean: "resin shimmered, pulled by gravity and pattern." Read-aloud ear flows seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: non-magical mage as celestial accountant transforms tropes via dripping-rate rebuild, risking quiet lyricism that heightens fragile stakes. Inevitable hindsight from early observations to fish breach.</comment>
