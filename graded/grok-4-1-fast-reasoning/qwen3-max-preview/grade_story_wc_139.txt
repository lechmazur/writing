<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Child's motivation rooted in concrete theft and rewriting of father's contract, with embodied weeping at recognition showing contradictory impulses; secondary characters like mortician apply relevant pressure without diluting focus. Minor abstraction in "mathematics of fair trade" borders label-speak but ties to pivotal ink use.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of ink transformations builds density from child's solo use to communal spread, culminating in Charged Poise closure where child leaves with internal "second pulse" and father's reckoning legible as conceptual cost. Orientation anchored early in prep room; one tightening via mortician's entry spreads stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ink pot and prep room tools (scalpels, tray) constrain waiting and writing choices; sensory specifics like "burnt parchment and ozone" and "formaldehyde" charge final image of ink left unlocked. Micro-setting mirrors "deathly vitality" paradox without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of fair trade equity signaled early, escalates accumulatively as ink use draws others, narrowing to ink depletion and child's forward reckoning with father; agency in sharing pen forecloses vengeful force for patient breach, with depletion as felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of liquefying deception emerges organically from ink dissolving clauses and rigid thinking, reweighting con artist's legacy in final image of pot left for others; resonant without moralizing, counter-readings in "nothing and everything" add complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable third-person close POV with perceptual bias toward fluid math and waiting; voice texture distinct in rhythmic phrases like "deathly vitality," modulating to luminescence spread. Sparse dialogue natural and subtextual, e.g., mortician's "What does it cost?" advances breach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm in metaphors like "sugar in hot tea"; minor figurative density in peak ink uses and one "waiting actively" repetition avoid loops but slightly thicken pressure beats without obscuring closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Magical ink pot transforms con artist trope into equity architect via funeral home alchemy; fresh synthesis of grift reckoning and fluid geometry feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative spread heightening stakes.</comment>
