<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Poet's motivation to uncover time's texture compels tactile engagement with rope, earning her lighter departure; contradictory delight in ambiguity acts in celebrating Silas without judgment. Interiority embodied via palms absorbing story "like tea into bone." Final village sharing reveals values hierarchy with cost of ongoing quest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: nightly rope tracings accumulate to beings' light revelation, tightening into village reconfiguration. On-page CR closure via rope-as-bridge image reweights impossible choices pattern with village's smoldering cost legible. Orientation anchored early in grotto under starlight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recurring rope and grotto clay constrain poet's attention, charging final bridge image; sensory hierarchy (humming auroras, warm floor) filters through tactile bias. Canyon yawn and violet shadows evolve with descent, mirroring internal weave. Micro-setting (rope spiral) shapes revelation beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (time's texture via impossible choices) signaled early, deepens decisively when light traces rope frays as "record," narrowing to village application under textural lens. Agency in uncoiling rope forces factions' recognition; cost felt in smoldering village and poet's richer questions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of fluid morality emerges organically from rope's frays as reevaluation marks, answered non-literally by village weaving tension into bridge. Rope motif recharges without shouting, tying Silas evasion to elders' paralysis. Ambiguity lingers in poet's departing questions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual texture signature ("fibers whispering," "tears become revelation") modulates from introspective hum to carrying speech; stable single POV biases toward tactile layers. Village dialogue natural, subtext-laden: "chose not to choose—and in that refusal, he chose everything."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short gasps amid poetic swells); density high, metaphors consistent (weave/stitch pattern taught early). Minor overwrite in opening frays ("panic and grit") risks density in revelation beat but serves voice; no loops, propulsion clear to bridge image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of escape rope as tactile archive with energy beings' stitching transforms choice dilemma into woven bridge; risk in lyric textural drive heightens stakes, inevitable in village square uncoiling.</comment>
