<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sacrifice at climax earned through consistent longing rooted in amber bead and lost courier; embodied via trembling fingers and humming without therapy-speak. Minor archetypal wistfulness limits deeper contradictions in pivotal weaving choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via motif density to CR closure in floating tapestry and bead arrival, reweighting premise with self-dissolution cost legible at "only her intent remained." Orientation anchored early; single tightening at puzzle discovery pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orchard, bamboo, and loom constrain rebuilding and weaving tactics; amber bead as micro-setting charges final man-reception image with glowing warmth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake to send message tightens texturally via puzzle-to-self-weave escalation driven by agency; cost unmistakable in dissolving memories and empty chair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emergent theme of transcendent sacrifice resonates non-literally in upward blossoms and star-woven essence, reweighting initial silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with weaving-biased perceptual signature modulates rhythmically to charged poise; stable single-POV to brief closing shard coherent under textural lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Purposeful motif repetition like "unraveling tapestry" propels density without obscuring; figurative density overwrites slightly in weaving passes, bordering coherence slip at climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Puzzle-to-portal loom and self-weave synthesis transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in essence-transmission feels inevitable and fresh in hindsight.</comment>
