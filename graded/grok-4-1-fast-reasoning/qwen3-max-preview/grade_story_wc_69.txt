<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's embodied endurance—humming amid resignation—shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, earning the closure choice to teach the girl; backstory anchors tilt present without flattening pressure. Minor epiphanic phrasing like "hatred unlearned" borders therapy-speak but doesn't touch pivotal arrival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via textural density buildup (reflections, creaks) to Charged Poise closure; girl's arrival reconfigures waiting with felt cost of years in "expectantly resigned." Orientation anchors early (Elara tracing rosette); no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Velvet library and rosette micro-setting constrain attention/choices (fingers linger, final gesture), charging closure image; autumn leaves mirror internal states through POV filter without overt symbolism. Sensory hierarchy (sound absorption key) fits choir teacher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmony recall) signaled early tightens accumulatively via creaks to girl, forcing stance crystallization with cost (unlearned world); agency in endurance/humming forecloses isolation path. One decisive cadence shift sufficient, legible price in final invite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of harmony via subtraction emerges from particulars (rosette, humming, lesson); final image non-literally answers via "subtracting noise," reweighting premise without moralizing. No thematic echo; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd POV with distinct musical perceptual signature (vibrations, chords); rhythmic control modulates to peak calm at dialogue. Minimal dialogue natural/subtextual ("Good... haven't learned how to get it wrong"); no head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm/syntax propels via musical motifs; purposeful figurative layering taught early pays off without muddle. Minor paraphrase loops in subtraction reflections (−0.3), but no closure touch; read-aloud ear strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vanishing arts/teacher vigil via rosette as inward portal transforms mentor trope; risk-taking lyric accumulation heightens quiet stakes organically. No derivative echoes; inevitable in hindsight via subtraction motif.</comment>
