<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Revelation at "Midway through, she paused—not from fatigue, but revelation" earns closure by transmuting face blindness from deficit to lens, with contradictory impulses in lifelong belief vs tactile essence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via texture buildup to CR closure; final "She closed her eyes, and smiled" crystallizes Charged Poise with conceptual cost of isolation as wrecking ball nears.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Coin as micro-setting constrains painting via "thumb along the coin’s edge, feeling valleys and ridges," charging final image under painted sky.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Midway revelation deepens stake from preservation to transmutation under textural lens, forcing faster painting as "radios crackling with countdowns"; cost in foreclosed display legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final lines "they saw faces and called them whole; she felt contours and called them truth" deliver resonant CR reweighting sight vs texture without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tactile perceptual signature in "each pore and lash a map of muscle and memory she felt rather than saw" sustains POV stability and rhythmic texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Painting sequence density layers sensation without loops; "brush became an extension of the guild’s original intent" propels texturally to clean final propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesizing face blindness with coin-constellations in doomed tree yields fresh, inevitable CR; risks bold perceptual inversion heightening stakes.</comment>
