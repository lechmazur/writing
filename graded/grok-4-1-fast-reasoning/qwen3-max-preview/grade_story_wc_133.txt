<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in trembling brush and muttering "I’m trying not to ruin you again," earning the exchange with embodied cost; wry earnestness constrains magic denial amid awe; flawless single-POV arc under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds via object discoveries to journal revelation, landing Charged Poise closure in "Trade accepted" and seaglass reprise with legible cost of release; orientation anchored early, no debt; pattern holds seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tidal island's rain trails and "tide forgets to leave" constrain discoveries and exchange, charging final seaglass image; sensory hierarchy (warm brooch vs. chill air) biases via painter's priorities; lived-in evolution mirrors internal bleed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (threshing meaning) signaled early, deepens via journal's emotional imprint reveal forcing exchange trade-off; cost unmistakable in forfeited canvas/brooch and earned sleep; agency crystallizes under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of "grief becomes legacy" emerges organically from objects to "convergence changes hands," reweighting prior losses in seaglass without moralizing; final image offers non-literal resonance with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature ("silver veins," "fractal shadows") biases via painter's eye; stable close-third modulates rhythm with intensity; purposeful compression taught early pays off in charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines like "ocean had become a librarian of loss"; figurative consistency (trapped sunset, pulsing maps) purposeful without muddle; minor density in opening beat doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh post-wars synthesis of emotional amber and temporal convergence transforms loss tropes via painter's exchange; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes, inevitable in seaglass handoff.</comment>
