<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to unbind unfinished beauty drives micro-choices like bow draws revealing acoustic perception, with grandmother/mother backstory tilting present play; child emergence earns communal shift. Minimal simultaneous internal contradiction limits to very strong; no therapy-speak or stock emotions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vibrations accumulate responses (ripples, vines stir, child descends) tightening to Charged Poise closure in petal float and lingering note; cost legible in deepened hush and "not to fix, but to unbind." Single scene, orientation anchored early, pattern taught immediately.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse/shipwrecks constrain play (panes hum, hatch creaks) and charge final bowl image; sensory hierarchy (acoustic over visual) reflects Lira's bias, evolves causally. Micro-setting (violin, bowl) shapes choices perfectly for lyric scope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unbind trapped silence) signaled early, escalates texturally via intensifying environmental/child responses narrowing to endurance in unfinished hush; agency in sustained play forecloses fixity with felt tenderness cost in final smile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in unfinished emerges organically from plays unbinding petals/hatch/child, resonating in petal float without moralizing; final image reweights hush as sacred canvas, inviting ambiguity on completion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-close POV stable with acoustic perceptual signature ("silence between notes"); rhythmic prose modulates intensity (trembling note to held breath), purposeful compression taught early pays off in closure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "note trembles outward, brushing panes"); varied rhythm, no loops/artifacts, figurative consistency (unbinding, ripples) supports lyric propulsion without muddle in peak responses.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh post-burn echo-harbor synthesis transforms apocalyptic tropes via acoustic unbinding and bowl compass; risk in lyric hush-charging poise feels inevitable, no template echoes.</comment>
