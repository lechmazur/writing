<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "trembling palm" vs. proceeding to burn, earning final transformation; embodied fear ("knees cracking") particularizes without labels; micro-choices like threading the reel reveal hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from shell murmur to chant to silent closure at "The shell falls silent"; on-page DC (burning reel) with felt release cost legible in "shift, the release"; orientation anchored early ("rusted library", "tonight").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via "three corridors east" and "beneath its base"; stars charge final "witnesses" image; selective sensory (dust swirling, embers) mirrors internal states through POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate from betrayal) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via decoding/shell chant narrowing to burn; agency in "thread it... press play" forecloses path with library's "sigh into ash" cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade><comment>Theme of betrayal-to-liberation emerges via shell/cast particulars shifting to "vulnerability... sharpest truths"; final image reweights premise non-literally without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("move like fear given legs") biases noticing; rhythmic control modulates from murmur to "hammering" under stress; stable first-person distance serves lyric aims.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density propels, but figurative overload slightly strains in peak ("celluloid curling like a dying snake"); minor "trembling" repetition; rhythm varies naturally, closure image sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh stunt-double frame transforms betrayal via shell/cast decryption; risk in poetic voice heightens stakes organically; final "salt and second chances" feels inevitable synthesis.</comment>
