<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in choosing melancholy song over rage, embodied in throat raw at dawn; final endurance earned by layered revelations, foreclosing destruction with soul-lighter cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: progressive disclosures build density to closure RR (entity shrinks to sigh in willow roots), cost legible in "throat raw, soul lighter"; single tightening via third-layer weep suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Serpentine nexus coils constrain singing venue and entity nest, charging final image of petrified willow roots; sensory bias (frequencies in marrow) filters through her perception perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel echo theft) tightens via weep-disclosure, her agency in lullaby-singing forecloses violent path under accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in raw throat, lighter soul.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Resonant non-literal answer: singing returns resonance, reweighting harvest premise as listening sigh; emerges organically from particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical perceptual signature (veins of silver, marrow vibrations) biases richly, rhythmic control modulates from tremble to harmonize without slippage; stable close POV fits lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density propels via multi-job lines (e.g., shell cradled "against her ribs" embodies and advances); figurative coherence in lyric pattern-taught mode, no loops dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: echo-residues harvested by silence-entity, undone by lullaby, risks bold lyric fantasy with inevitable hindsight payoff in entity's curious sigh.</comment>
