<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silas's motivation rooted in grief is embodied through repeated folding and polishing, with contradictory impulses (transform sorrow vs. its return) culminating in the earned vessel transformation at climax. Interiority concrete via gem essences and crane wings trembling with names. Final sapphire polish reveals character hierarchy of values, confronting flaws with cost in release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from lantern tending to basilica hum, tightening via shadow's ascent into a CR closure as sapphire drop folds world, tucking pain with undeniable conceptual cost in final crane image. Orientation anchored early in floating isle retreat. One meaningful deepening via new-key hum narrows options coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating isle, tea garden, and basilica constrain choices (pruning to carrying lanterns to nave) and charge final image (garden blooms reverse, isle drifts sideways). Sensory hierarchy selective (steaming tea, humming spires, tea leaves upright) mirrors torment via refracted light. Details evolve causally, POV-biased toward grief-lenses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contain shadow via preserved dreams) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through hum and shadow climb, forcing agency in shattering lanterns and dropping sapphire. Tightening forecloses containment path with trade-off cost legible in freed dreams' spirals. Climax crystallization reweights under lens without coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief's transformation emerges organically from particulars (cranes, gems, shadow), culminating in resonant CR where final crane reweights loss into grace without moral state. Subtext in implications (shadow as mirror, sapphire silence) invites ambiguity. No tidy binaries; complexity lingers in sideways drift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature: noticing via soot fingers, ember eyes, dream-glass facets. Lyrical rhythm modulates intensity, compression taught early (poetic elisions) pays off in charged closure image. Prose as character reflects tormented mind without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short dirge lines at climax), high density advances all layers without loops, though minor figurative density in opening risks overwrite (−0.3). Propulsion clear, closure chord image unblurred. No scaffold; purposeful metaphors consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-capture mechanics, shadow ivy-climb, reverse-bloom garden transforms tropes organically. Risky sideways dimension and folding world heighten stakes, inevitable in hindsight via gem/crane logic. No derivatives; singular vision coheres.</comment>
