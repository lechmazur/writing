<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve trust is concrete via village backstory cueing present vigilance; buckle micro-choices embody contradictory patience/prepare impulses. Minor slip: poised competence lacks on-page internal friction during chime moment, tilting toward summary endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with silence density tightening to chime vibration; Charged Poise closure at "She walked on... frame it, revise it" reconfigures burden with felt ongoing cost. Orientation anchors immediately; no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating arbor, ironwood railing, bioluminescent vines constrain chime/sky-bridge choices and charge final step-off image. Sensory selection (hush between breezes, low frequency tremble) biases via POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trust preservation) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via silence vacuum forcing chime agency; lanterns' blink shows foreclosed panic path with communal cost. Minor abstractness in stakes scale mutes visceral peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of managed silence as bearable emerges from buckle chime to final vow/image without statement; reweights premise via "burden... gift" resonance in walking on.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (spaces between silences); rhythmic prose modulates to charged poise at re-clipping click. No dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied rhythm; minor paraphrase loops on "silence" (e.g., "vacuum of silence... silence screamed") dull two beats without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh sky-whale/arbor world synthesizes vigilance motif organically; risk in lyric silence signals heightens stakes, transforming trope inventively.</comment>
