<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Superior interiority and embodied contradiction shine in "fingers trembled around the vintage opera glasses" versus "chin lifted as if daring the universe," compelling the whispered aria that earns her purpose-driven stance; flaws absent from closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably from vibration buildup to Charged Poise closure in "She stood. They stood with her.

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance over violence emerges organically from particulars like aria seeding hum, culminating in non-literal "remembering how to listen" that reweights lull without moralizing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density propels via varied syntax and purposeful "hum" recurrence without loops; minor figurative density in thunder beat integrates without muddling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spaceport over ancient circle, barefoot attunement, and opera glasses reprise transforms rebellion trope; risk in lyric Accumulative drive heightens stakes inevitably.</comment>
