<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong motivation rooted in functional creativity drives micro-choices like steam redirection, embodied in grease-stained overalls and sextant use; lacks sharper internal contradiction or blind spots complicating peak adaptation, but endurance of imperfections earns closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build from exploration to communal pulses; CR closure in "H = Σ(ΔI • R)" reconfigures ruin with legible cost of persistent cracks, one tightening via thermal anomaly to warmth payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details like fractured skylight prisms and peeling hazard stripes constrain choices (scavenge kiosks) and charge final mosaic image; sensory hierarchy reflects engineer's bias toward structural flows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resurrection signaled early escalates accumulatively through anomaly redirection and kinetic tiles, narrowing to hope-equation deepening; cost visible in "walls still cracked" foreclosing perfect restoration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of resilient hope emerges organically from redirected steam/light/footsteps without statement; final equation reweights premise non-literally, resonant with counter-reading of enduring flaws.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with distinct perceptual signature (decay as "poetry," equations in tilt); rhythmic modulation suits stoic wonder, purposeful compression legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm propels via image integration; minor figurative density in descriptive beats ("curling like breath") borders overwriting but pattern-taught without muddle or loops touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi ruin-revival via engineer's flows transforms tropes organically; sextant-for-angles and hope-equation inflection risks boldly, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
