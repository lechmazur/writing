<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sage's motivation to harness ephemeral drives micro-choices like silencing breath amid shaking, embodied in "luminous ache" without therapy-speak; earned transcendence via tenderness shows contradictory surrender/control. Interiority concrete via memory-cued leaf sound. Closure choice legible as renunciation of force.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from spinning hand to synced pulses, culminating in braided time RR/Charged Poise; leaf sound delivers on-page reconfiguration with surrender cost in "leaned into the luminous ache." Orientation anchored early in lunar observatory/Time of Shaking. Single scene, lens holds cleanly to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero-gravity dome, plinth/lenses constrain repair ritual; recurring hand/object charges final legible spin as language of continuity. Sensory hierarchy (whirl blur, dust rain, leaf whisper) filters via sage's priorities, mirroring internal reconfiguration. Clouds parting mosaic recharges Earth moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restructure time) signaled early, tightens via leaf sound deepening sync amid intensifying shake; agency in waiting/memory invocation forecloses force path with felt ache cost. Pressure coheres accumulatively, narrowing to tender transcendence under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of transcendence via tenderness emerges implicitly from hand's shift/leaf echo/braided time, avoiding morals; final mosaic Earth image offers non-literal resonant answer to linear prison, reweighting ephemeral honor. Subtext in paradox compass charges closure without binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice distinct in perceptual bias (light bends grief, silence echoes); syntax/rhythm modulate from whirling chaos to braided cadence, stable single POV. Patterned diction (spin motifs) taught early, legible payoff at shutter click. No elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short punchy ticks to flowing braids), high density integrates image/action; figurative consistency (luminous ache motif) pattern-taught without muddle, though minor synonym churn on "spin" in opening. Propulsion clear to closure whir; no loops obscure cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera repair/time sage with leaf-sound restructuring transforms sci-fi tropes via tender escape velocity; bold lyric risk in moon-top ritual heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight from paradox compass to mosaic Earth.</comment>
