<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation and micro-choices under pressure, like timing steps to bell chimes near guards, reveal patient competence without safety-hedging; contradictory calm amid risk earns final endurance. Minor slip in occasional stock poetic abstraction dilutes interior specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building from preparation to execution; Charged Poise closure in rooftop dawn image reconfigures silent revolution premise with felt risk cost legible in guards' obliviousness and precise alignment. Orientation anchors immediately; one tightening via courtyard tracing suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blackout shadows and sundial gnomon constrain key choices like angle revelation and tracing; final horizon blush charges closure image, mirroring internal success. Sensory selection (clinking quill, scuffing boots) reflects POV urgency without catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silent revolution) signaled early tightens accumulatively through courtyard execution near guards, narrowing detection options with agency in alignment and escape; cost legible in timed proximity to oblivious sentries forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of subtle geometric dissent vs. overt action emerges organically via sundial codes and shadow map; final image offers resonant non-literal answer—revolution via patience—reweighting particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stable single POV with distinct perceptual signature (geometric hush, shadow meanings); rhythmic prose modulates intensity from poised observation to taut action without filter excess or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion with varied rhythm; figurative stack in courtyard ("sharp as dagger points, gentle as lullabies") slightly overwrites pressure beat, docking from peak without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geometric cipher revolution transforms intrigue tropes; sundial codes as manifesto feel inevitable from patient setup, with risk-taking in shadow-reliance heightening stakes organically.</comment>
