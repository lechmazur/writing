<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elira's reactively visionary trait compels particular actions like matching widow's melody to valve mechanism, rooting motivation in consistent, non-stereotypical flaws; internal endurance of loss earns closure proposal with embodied cost in unpolished valve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from valve cipher to grief-map scroll, landing Conceptual Repricing closure in rite's voices and "absences...woven into rhythm" with conceptual cost of honored silence; orientation anchored early, reflection interleaved without flattening drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harbor's fog, gulls, and brine actively collaborate as "setting," constraining deductions (e.g., valve corrosion triangulates buoy) and charging final valve-in-palm image; sensory selectivity reflects Elira's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of navigating absences tightens accumulatively via fragment accrual to council proposal, forcing trade-off of no memorials for voiced silence; agency in staggered listening narrows options, cost legible in "hollows where voices...ceased calling back."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of honoring absence's shape emerges organically from particulars like chalk drawings and valve at chart center, resonating in rite's "chord only absence could compose" without moralizing; final image reweights loss as navigable geography.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable single-POV with perceptual signature (patterns in voids, harbor as collaborator) modulates rhythmically; purposeful poetic compression taught early pays off in charged closure image without leakage or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density in integrated metaphors like "trust accrue like tide-silt"; minor figurative density in reflective beats (e.g., "mapping grief into geography") without muddle, but occasional paraphrase of process slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist mapping absences transforms grief tropes via valve cipher and rite tradition; risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes of silence as "deeper harbor," inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
