<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Character motivation rooted in obsession with absence drives endurance of storm and time pressure, shown through embodied actions like tracing pages and whispering glyphs; interiority concrete via calloused fingers and sideways listening. Final descent earned as renunciation of escape, foreclosing return with cost of vanishing. Minor weakness: contradictory impulses more implied than simultaneous in scene, no strong internal conflict acting concurrently.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of summarized silences builds to map's completion; orientation anchored immediately in who/where/when. Closure as Conceptual Repricing: she enters mapped night ("descended into the dark... entering the territory"), reweighting silence as chartable with conceptual cost of her disappearance legible in "vanished into the night she had drawn." No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory hierarchy: cold salt-crusted stone under bare feet, wind's howl muted to heartbeat in ambered hush, constraining her solitary stance atop crumbling fort. Recurring booklet flakes as micro-setting charge final tuck-away image, mirroring obsession. Setting evolves causally with star's guttering, guiding descent without spatial confusion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake to map endless night signaled early, escalates texturally via accumulating silence glyphs (child’s laugh, lover’s turn) to gull cry addition under fading star pressure. One tightening: star gutters, forcing book closure and descent as endurance with cost of "time measured in sighs." Cost unmistakable in her vanishing, charging poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of charting absence emerges organically from particulars like unsung pauses plotted as coordinates, culminating in resonant final image of marbled hush welcoming her entry. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether map saves others, reweighting silence from withholding to anchor without literal answer. Protagonist arc inextricable from proving night "could be known, could be held."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinct perceptual signature: notices "hollows between" sounds, syntax rhythmic like "moth wings brushing glass." Stable close third-person POV filters storm through hush bias, modulating to charged calm at close. Purposeful compression of silences taught early, paid off legibly in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "spine cracking like dry twigs beneath snow" advances prop and texture); rhythm varies for propulsion, metaphors consistent in decay/resin motifs without muddle. Minor overwrite in silence summaries risks paraphrase feel, but pattern-taught and purposeful. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: oracle cartographing silences transforms prophecy trope into absence-architecture, with bold lyric risk of minimal action heightening stakes via time/star constraint. Final reconfiguration inevitable from obsession particulars; no derivative echoes, authentic vision in marbled hush payoff.</comment>
