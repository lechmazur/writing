<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority via embodied actions like chalk notations on forearm and holding breath amid fragility; motivation to prove patterns compels micro-choices scaling to personal reconfiguration as conduit. Minor abstraction in "thistle-blown hope" phrasing borders stock without full contradiction in peak visions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from star alignments to visions and self-inclusion, landing CR closure in "She understood then: the beacon-tower... was a receiver" with fragility cost legible in misalign risk. Orientation anchored early in pavilion walk; single scene holds without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration (wind-thistle-salt, glass moan) constrains choices via fractured panes enabling star views and tripod setup. Pavilion hum evolves causally, charging final "sighed... lullaby" image; body/prism as micro-settings pressure alignment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle via prism proof) signaled early, deepens via agency-driven alignments triggering visions/personal weave under Accumulative lens. One tightening (Cassiopeia chorus) narrows to fragile poise; cost unmistakable in "One misaligned star... collapse like sand."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of convergences emerges organically from vision linkages (child-scholar-soldier), resonant CR in life's "accidents" as summons reweighting premise without statement. Final prism pulse answers "coincidences?" non-literally, lingering ambiguity in fragile certainty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stable close third-person limited with perceptual signature of pattern-tracking (star ghost-trails, fractured geometry). Lyrical rhythm modulates from moan to chorus under pressure; purposeful compression in visions pays off legibly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied syntax/rhythm (short adjustments amid long harmonics); figurative language purposeful in peak visions ("unspooling time’s echo") without muddle. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion clear in "adjusted... inch by inch" to pulse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-collapse mysticism via retrocognitive prism and star-convergences transforms tropes; risk in lyric accumulative structure heightens fragile stakes. "Shard of hush" premise commits fully, inevitable in hindsight via pavilion/prism weave.</comment>
