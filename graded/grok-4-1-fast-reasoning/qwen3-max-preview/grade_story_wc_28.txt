<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elira's interior contradiction—trapped backward by conscience yet prying the tessera forward—earns her final endurance; micro-choices like pressing shard to palm reveal values under pressure. Magistrate applies targeted opposition, forcing public stance. Reflection anchors to concrete cues (fractures mirroring wounds) without flattening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echoes, renamings, and survivors builds to CR closure in plaza humming with purpose, cost legible in "aberrant mercy bled" and Elira's faint smile as past walks beside. Orientation anchored early (plaza, ash, minaret). No lens ambiguity; persistent tessera constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tesserae recur to constrain choices (pried as key, bite palm, handed, selected) and charge final image of survivors whispering truths. Sensory hierarchy POV-specific: ash as grief, wind mourning, glinting sun on patterns. Atmosphere tensions passive mercy via fractured arches guiding active renaming.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rename mercy) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via magistrate confrontation and crowd joining, narrowing to public practice. Agency in announcement and gesture forecloses passive sigh with embodied cost (shard bite). Escalation coheres under lens without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges via particulars: renaming beggar to "keeper of stories" reweights mercy implicitly until earned speech, final image of humming plaza answers without moralizing. Resonance from counter-reading (old vs. aberrant) lingers in steel arms. Minor friction from articulated thesis in Elira's announcement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (fractures as soul wounds, tesserae as echoes) stable in single POV; rhythm modulates from introspective to struck-bronze carrying. Dialogue goal-driven: magistrate's "name one thing" pivots him. Diction controlled, no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: lines layer image/action (e.g., "pressed the blue shard... edges bite just enough"). Varied rhythm, no loops or scaffolds; purposeful metaphors taught early (mosaic patterns) cohere without muddle in peak (crowd renaming). Minor overwriting in opening imagery contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tesserae as renaming compass transforms ruin tropes into aberrant mercy practice. Risk in conceptual pivot (passive to steel-armed) heightens stakes organically. Irreplaceable: removing renaming cascade breaks closure hum.</comment>
