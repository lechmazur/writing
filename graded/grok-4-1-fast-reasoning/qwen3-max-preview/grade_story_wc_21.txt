<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Solitary archivist's motivation to uncover "truth in tension" drives micro-choices like debris arrangements, with embodied conflict in failed whispers vs. persistent offerings; interiority concrete in "vibrating in her marrow," but epiphanies like "she became the archive" edge toward unearned diagnostic clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as resonance density builds from whispers to lagoon glow, delivering Charged Poise closure in final humming/waist-deep stance with conceptual cost of witness-trapping; orientation anchors early via zeppelin/dunes/lagoon; one tightening via parley realization narrows solo attempts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains via tide-gnawing debris and anniversary fluctuations shaping rituals, charging closure image of "zeppelin’s shadow rippling over water"; sensory hierarchy (brine/burnt cedar, cool grit) filters through archivist's priorities without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of parley-driven decryption escalates accumulatively to glow response, forcing endurance/renunciation of transcription for oral witness with felt cost in "retrocognitively trapped" surrender; agency in iterated arrangements tightens pressure coherently under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth as "unbearable, searing reverie" emerges organically from debris-liturgy to seashell dreams, with final image reweighting listening as justice without moralizing; resonance from particulars like "kelp braided into chains" avoids platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual signature of archival metaphors ("living ledger"); rhythmic modulation peaks in glow scene's "slow, subaquatic glow rising," modulating intensity purposefully; no dialogue or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax/rhythm, but figurative overwriting in opening ("history itself had reached through the veil to press its palm") pervades pre-climax beats, dulling some immediacy without muddling closure glow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of civil-rights archive with supernatural parley transforms ghost-story tropes via debris-messages and retrocognitive grief; risk in zeppelin-lagoon frame heightens stakes, inevitable in hindsight at seashell-dream payoff.</comment>
