<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivation rooted in patient ritualism shines through micro-choices like mounting sensors and waiting through twitches, earning the restoration of trust; embodied patience in "She held her breath" during climax shows contradictory hope-fear without labels. Final endurance forecloses false-alarm path with village trust as cost. No unearned epiphanies or stock traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds density from ascent to tolling climax with one tightening (rope trembles then stills, reweighting stake); closure as Charged Poise lands on-page in bell's resonant note rolling down, with patience cost felt in slack rope image. Orientation anchored early in stairwell climb; no shards, defaults met.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains via rope path and wind surges shaping sensor triggers; sanctuary's arches frame clouds gathering, charging final raindrops-kissing-soil image that mirrors internal trust restoration. Sensory hierarchy (wind's song, ion surges) filters through her listening bias, vivid yet selective. No white-room; lived-in choreography of belfry work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (true listening vs. false noise) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via micro-variations twitching sensors then full rope rise, narrowing to toll-or-fail; agency in calibration forces endurance trade-off with years-distrust cost legible in village pause. Climax toll crystallizes stance with promise-rain payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of subtle listening over alarm emerges organically from sensor rituals and bell's "blessing" vs. past "chaos"; final image of slack rope "like a contented cat" and rain "in promise" reweights premise non-literally, embracing ambiguity of faith-without-panic. No moralizing; irony in villagers hearing arrival, not threat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close third-person POV with perceptual signature of harmonizing hums and sky-whispers; rhythmic prose modulates from ascent's whispers to toll's deep resonance, distinct texture in wind-particular diction. No head-hopping or withhold; lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "rope coiled tighter... began to rise" advances action-atmosphere); varied rhythm passes read-aloud test, no loops or scaffolds. Minor figurative density in setup ("needle stitching heaven") coheres in lyric mode but borders overwrite pre-climax; peak toll clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm-testing ritual with bell-rope sensors transforms siren trope into trust-calibration premise; risk of lyric accumulation heightens stakes via microclimate precision, inevitable in hindsight at tolling. No derivatives; bold voice commits to listening conceit.</comment>
