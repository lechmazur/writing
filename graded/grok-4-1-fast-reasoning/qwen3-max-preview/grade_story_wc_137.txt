<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elira's sympathetic skepticism shows in concrete interior conflict at "skepticism warred with sensation," compelling the earned shift to presence without tidy epiphany; flaws like doubt enable the micro-choice to transcribe feeling over solving. Courageously kind trait constrains final act of leaving the score for wanderers with visible cost to her solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory density unfolds to whale-song sync ("its pulse syncing with the whale’s call"), tightening to CR closure where Elira reconfigures magic as entanglement, forgoing solution with felt cost in "She didn’t solve the tile’s mystery that night. She didn’t need to."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower balcony and tile constrain choices via winds threading whale song through arches and vibrational pulse guiding hand; final image of pulsing tile on dais charges closure. Sensory hierarchy (rhythms over visuals) reflects Elira's pattern-seeking POV without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of skepticism vs. wonder escalates texturally through memory overlap to heartbeat sync, narrowing options to endurance via presence; agency in sustained attention forecloses puzzle-solving with cost felt in breath-caught realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of entangled remembrance emerges implicitly via tile's harmonics syncing human/whale/star patterns, answered non-literally in score transcription as "Notes of solitude. Crescendos of connection"; reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with rhythmic signature ("breathing in time with the ocean’s hidden giants") modulates intensity consistently; stable close third-person limited filters via pattern-biased perception, no elision or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., "fingertips on the tile’s edges. It didn’t burn or hum—it remembered") propels via varied syntax; minor overwriting in stacked metaphors ("emotional harmonics, an unheard symphony") slightly muddles peak sync beat without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic tile as vibrational conduit entangling whales/stars/human awe transforms forgotten-pattern trope; risk-taking in textural sync risks opacity but heightens stakes via irreplaceable rhythmic payoff.</comment>
