<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—hollowed trust versus spiteful faith—act in pressing the bolt, earning her reconfiguration from survivor to light-tender with channeled betrayal costs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as texts densify to convergence; closure RR lands on-page in "seam crystallized... lattice of pure clarity" with existential pressure as felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mushroom grove constrains climax (caps lean/flare), charges final singing image; sensory filter (ozone/libraries) mirrors her alchemical shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake to anchor promise escalates via personalized texts to pressure-mount; agency in channeling past forecloses naivety with clarity cost on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final "quantum promise... harvest" non-literally answers pressure-to-diamonds premise, reweighting betrayal into tended justice without moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stable single-POV perceptual signature (fireflies in static, shadowseam) rhythms with pressure; minimal dialogue natural/subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density propels (e.g., "shadows stitched into seams"); minor opening figurative lushness doesn't obscure closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pyramid-quantum alchemy via bolt totem synthesizes fresh; "shadowseam wonder" risks bold mysticism cohering stakes.</comment>
