<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation via grandmother's gift and physical toll (ache, blisters), with micro-choices in soft playing revealing resolute values; minimal internal contradiction limits to very strong, as no flawed impulses complicate peak resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via escalating musical resonances causing statue transformations; on-page RR closure in orchard awakening and shell-to-dust with exhaustion cost; orientation anchored immediately in sky-bridge/orchard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Selective details like metallic apples and creaking statues constrain her distant signaling and charge final sapling/apple image; sensory hierarchy (tactile ghost on stone) mirrors musical POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken vs. mechanical patrol) tightens via density increase in statue reactions/weeping; protagonist agency in key-shifts forecloses violent options with blister cost legible in climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of husked beauty emerges organically from locust/playing particulars, reweighted in final molting image without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in her baptismal apple bite.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with musical perceptual signature (vibrato as heart rhythms) stable in third-limited POV; rhythmic control heightens pressure in climax without head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel, but figurative density in peak ("curlled downward like a falling leaf") borders overwriting without muddle; minor "not with X, but Y" patterns purposeful yet repetitive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music-as-resonance molting mechanical stasis into organic pulse; risk in lyric accumulation pays off in inevitable statue-gardener transformation.</comment>
