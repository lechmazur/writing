<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied conflict in "fingers trembled not from cold, but from the bravely conflicted storm within," driving the placement on the Resonance Table; final resolve at "truth doesn’t need volume" earns closure with visible cost of arrest. Interiority concrete and particular; no unearned epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of resonance builds to CR closure in library walls whispering, reweighting silence with societal cost; her calm amid guards crystallizes charged poise. Orientation anchored immediately; one continuous scene expands coherently without shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dormant networks in foundations and Resonance Table constrain release and charge final spectral image; sensory details like "cryo-wax cracked open with a sigh like breaking ice" integrate purposefully. Environment mirrors internal states through frost and echoes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth-release tightens accumulatively via table pulse to viral spread, narrowing options with arrest cost; agency in non-reading transmission forecloses suppression path. Escalation driven by her choice under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of buried truths breathing emerges organically from letter's resonance to societal contagion; final image of whispering walls offers non-literal answer reweighting silence without moralizing.

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional contagion via dormant networks transforms whistleblower trope; risk in quiet, viral scandalize heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight from kindling archives premise.</comment>
