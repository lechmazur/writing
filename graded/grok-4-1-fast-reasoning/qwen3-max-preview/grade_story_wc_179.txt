<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses between pacifist cunning and stored rage act vividly in embodied mapping of fury ("clenched jaw from childhood"), earning the internal melody shift as closure choice with cost of external mechanism's failure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density build to RR (Charged Poise: melody migrates internally, "from within"); cost legible in "The pin stayed broken" and box left as relic; orientation anchored instantly in sanctuary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-settings (body sinew, broken pin) constrain release choice and charge final image ("placed the box gently on the moss"); shifting walls ("stone, sometimes glass") mirror internal reconfiguration without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (internalize release amid shifting reality) tightens via ghost chime deepening under Accumulative lens, forcing endurance trade-off; agency in breath-mapping forecloses external reliance with felt bodily cost ("shoulders dropped half an inch").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of re-membering self for release emerges organically from pin-to-marrow migration, resonant in final image ("walked into the mist, humming") reweighting resentment without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical POV stable with perceptual signature (cellular whispers, sinew-listening); rhythmic modulation peaks in "warmth bloomed beneath her fingers," teaching patterned elision early for legible internal closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion via varied syntax; minor paraphrase loops on "silence" purposeful for textural build, but slight figurative density in peak ("ink bleeding into water") nudges from 9-band without obscuring chime payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifism as "hinge" with cellular engineering transforms introspection trope; risk in lyric dissolution ("walls dissolving into mist") heightens stakes organically to inevitable marrow humming.</comment>
