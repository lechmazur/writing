<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's quest for color of sound drives embodied choices like purposeful wandering and dive; internal shift from seeker to signifier earned via personal vow revelation with cycle-leaving cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds density from key tag to ledger discovery; CR closure in "no longer searching, but signifying" reconfigures quest with cost of ledger abandonment for next seeker.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sunken library constrains dive and charges CR via "ledger’s ink pulsed once, gently"; sensory details like "ship’s groans" and bioluminescent ink filter through synesthetic POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake signaled in "hunting the color of sound" deepens via self-vow revelation, narrowing to endurance; agency in closing eyes hears "cerulean streaked with amber" with madness/drowning cost felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of luminous vows binding truth emerges from ledger entries to pre-birth signature; final signifying walk offers resonant reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice stable in single POV with perceptual bias toward hues and silence; rhythm modulates to peak in "Sound had hue. Vows gave it form."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel without loops; metaphors cohere in synesthetic pattern, peaking propulsively at color revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic quest in drowned vow-library transforms tropes organically; risk-taking in CR closure feels inevitable from purposeful wandering motif.</comment>
