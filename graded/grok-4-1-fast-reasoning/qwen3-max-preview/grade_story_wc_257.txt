<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation in her "quieter, fiercer urge" and micro-choices like burnishing the stencil reveal hierarchy of values, earning stasis; lacks sharper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density building to Charged Poise closure in the locket-in-crane image; cost felt in suspended grief and release, anchored early without orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory's "curtains of intention" and workbench constrain choices and charge final image; sensory details filtered through ache bias, vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reroute sorrow) signaled early, tightens accumulatively when curtains stir remotely, forcing confirmation of impact with endurance cost; one deepening suffices under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of constructed authenticity emerges from particulars like origami and coordinates; final library steps image offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting grief without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrasing like "time pooled here like spilled ink"; stable close third-person with rhythmic control under reflective pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density and varied rhythm propel accumulatively; minor figurative density in opening reflective beat (e.g., "scraped her soul to marrow") slightly overwrites without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief artifacts (origami coordinates) and "genuinely artificial" sacred transforms tropes; risk in lyric observatory frame heightens stakes organically.</comment>
