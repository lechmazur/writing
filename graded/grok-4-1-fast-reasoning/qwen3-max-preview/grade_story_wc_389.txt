<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation rooted in fidelity to broken signals and shadows compels her final song, with contradictory pity for Kael and gritty laugh embodying internal conflict under storm pressure; micro-choices like scribbling prophetic lines reveal values with isolation cost. Final renunciation of sterile unity earned via prior decoding causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: prophetic fragments and storm density build to Charged Poise closure in cobalt-lit song-broadcast, reconfiguring world's signals with defiant cost against Kael; orientation anchored in opening lines, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory and cobalt portico constrain choices, from palm-press hum to song-triggered lattice; lightning strike on apex charges equations-wall image, mirroring internal evolution with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shadow-dawn vs sterile unity) signaled early, textural tightening via new radio voice "She's listening" forces song-agency, foreclosing clean harmony with felt cost of isolation-to-awakening spread; pressure coheres without reversal overload.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of earned dawn through shadows emerges via particulars like radio hymns and final broadcast weaving ancient wisdom; resonant CR in "unfold shadows into wings" reweights Kael's unity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (static as oracle bones, lightning as sapphire veins) biases noticing; rhythmic modulation peaks in raw song verse, stable limited POV with purposeful lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with metaphors like "origami wings" integrated into action; minor figurative density in opener but pattern-taught for accumulative mode, no loops or scaffolds dulling propulsion to closure song.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio-ghost prophecies vs neural prophet transforms dystopian tropes; gritty-whimsy voice and portico-broadcast risk heightens stakes organically, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
