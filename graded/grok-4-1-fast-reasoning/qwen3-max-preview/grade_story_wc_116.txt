<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Keeper's motivation to witness without judgment drives the burrow and return with embodied emotion (trembling palms, weeping for fragility); interiority concrete and particular, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal entry moment, tilting toward acceptance too smoothly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and holds: density spirals from library to visions to return, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure in "softened, like wax... smiled—knowing... rarest form of love," with felt cost of alteration and release legible in quill moment; orientation anchored early, no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Overgrown library, obsidian refuge, and origami swan constrain choices (unfolding as entry method) and charge final image (river murmurs indifferent); sensory details (moss, cinnamon, wet stone) selective via keeper's reverent POV, mirroring internal softening without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of judgment-free witnessing deepens accumulatively through visions' relentless change, narrowing to hesitation and earned reconfiguration (return altered); cost felt in "weight of what had been seen" released via quill, but lacks a single sharp trade-off narrowing live options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of unjudged change emerges organically from visions (forests grow teeth, lovers to dust) to resonant final image of crumbling peace as "rarest form of love," reweighting premise without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in beauty of fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature (reality "grips loosely," whispers become gusts); rhythmic prose modulates from reverent to inverted whirlpool, purposeful compression taught early and legible at closure; no head-hopping or withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene (short breaths in entry, expansive visions); high density integrates image/action, but figurative density borders overwriting in vision beat ("steam from tea, sugar in rain") without full pattern payoff, slightly dulling peak propulsion; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb archive as entropy-dance with origami portal and time-spiral visions; risk-taking in lyric non-causal structure heightens stakes of witnessing, transforming tropes (forgotten library) into inevitable reconfiguration without gimmickry.</comment>
