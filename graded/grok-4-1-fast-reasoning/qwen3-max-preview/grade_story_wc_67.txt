<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mask origin from mother's teacups and ritual micro-choices reveal consistent traits under pressure; visitor's cry tests endurance with felt cost in witnessed recognition. Minor slips in diagnostic phrasing like "she knows better" verge on epiphanic summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ritual setup to visitor interaction, culminating in Charged Poise closure as scatterer sits in still chair, reconfiguring absence into honored truth with conceptual cost of endured fragments legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gallery's dim light and rocking chair constrain ritual choices and charge final image; sensory details (bare feet whispering, powder settling like snowfall) filter through POV bias, evolving with dusk to mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of crystallizing emotion vs. safety mirage signaled early, tightens accumulatively via visitor's recognition forcing witness-stance; cost legible in chair's stillness foreclosing motion's illusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth from fragments emerges organically via ash ritual and mask shards, resonant final image of shimmering powder and lit candle reweighting safety's mirage without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close POV stable with perceptual signature in textured noticing (smoke-curling voice, powder snowfall); sparse dialogue natural, subtextual, distinguishing voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene needs, high density integrates image/action; minor overuse of ash/fragment metaphors borders coherence slip in peak ritual beat, but pattern-taught without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ash-scattering ritual and porcelain mask transforms absence/haunting tropes into inevitable conceptual repricing; risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
