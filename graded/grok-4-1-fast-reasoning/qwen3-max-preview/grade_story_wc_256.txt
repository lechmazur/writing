<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion in weeping from recognition of seeds, not sorrow; micro-choices like striking fork with reverence reveal values under pressure. Interiority concrete via prismatic hues on skin like braille. Minor abstract traits like "powerfully gentle" lean epiphanic without full contradiction in peak singing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from lens setup to singing releasing harmonies, culminating in Charged Poise RR where golden silence reconfigures assumptions with emotional cost (wept). Orientation anchored early in lab and post-grid world. One tightening via propelled voice suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lab's vacuum tubes and quartz pedestal constrain choices, charging final shimmer; recurring lens fractures vibrations tactilely. Sensory hierarchy (vibrations bending, hues with textures) POV-specific to resonance craft. Micro-setting evolves causally with song.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of connection) signaled early, tightens via propelled voice narrowing digital assumptions; cost legible in tears and glowing crack foreclosing emptiness view. Agency in singing/endurance reweights under Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of textured silence vs. digital gloss emerges via questions and released harmonies; final golden shadows non-literally answers "What if quiet is space for listening?" without moralizing. Resonance from particulars like market cries, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stable close-3rd with perceptual signature in sound textures (grain beneath gloss); rhythmic modulation peaks in sustained vowel. Purposeful lyric compression taught early, legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with multi-job lines (e.g., lens catches, fractures, casts); rhythm varies read-aloud. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors (hues carrying textures) during release, but consistent without muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-grid quiet world with sonic pilgrimage transforms connection tropes; lens/prism risk heightens resonance stakes organically. Inevitable hindsight via seed recognition.</comment>
