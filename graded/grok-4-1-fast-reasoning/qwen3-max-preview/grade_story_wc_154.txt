<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional interiority with embodied emotions (coral pulsing warm, limbs weighted) and contradictory impulses (dread of failed translation vs. empathetic decryption); final kinship realization earned by coral-cast synthesis with visible cost of non-erasure. Shrewd traits shown through scene actions, not labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds via image density to Charged Poise closure ("the smudges... rearranged"); orientation anchored in first paragraph; cost legible in "not healed... let it breathe," foreclosing erasure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atrium's mist and pillars constrain kneeling/decryption; coral/cast as micro-settings charge final image (coral cools post-transformation); sensory hierarchy (salt/mist via war lens) mirrors internal thaw without overt symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (graft meaning) tightens texturally via decryption reversal, narrowing to symbiotic endurance; agency in whispering forces reconfiguration; cost unmistakable in retained ache carried gracefully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of witnessed wounds braiding into kinship emerges organically from coral-cast unknotting; final silhouette image reweights anxieties without moralizing, inviting lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with perceptual signature (translator's metaphor decryption: "ink on wet paper"); stable close-third POV modulates rhythm under anesthetic stress; purposeful compression pays off in charged closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("mist curled around her ankles like hesitant ghosts"); metaphors coherent and escalating (needles/unknotting to blooming kinship); zero loops, flawless rhythm in peak decryption beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of anesthetic liminality and empathetic decryption transforms trauma tropes; coral-cast transformation feels inevitable from war relics, with bold lyric risk heightening resonance.</comment>
