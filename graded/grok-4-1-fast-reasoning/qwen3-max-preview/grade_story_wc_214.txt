<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority and motivation rooted in past hollowing ("weight of endless destruction") compel endurance in empathy; tears at comet's efflorescence earn subtle change with emotional cost. Minor idealization flattens minor contradictions, but micro-choices like pausing at lantern reveal values under quiet pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from routine meteors to rogue comet's plunge, delivering Conceptual Repricing in "flourishing stillness" recognition with tears as legible emotional cost. Orientation anchored early in station on Andromeda Drift; single scene tightens to charged closure image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Yellow lantern glass as micro-setting filters stars into "golden threads," constraining observation and charging final console placement. Sensory details (broom whispering, wind-chime sensors) selectively mirror reverence; cosmic rim station feels lived-in and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (strength in vulnerability) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via comet's hesitant dance to efflorescence, deepening empathy with tears as visible price. Quiet agency in tracing forecloses institutional past; one tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of flourishing stillness emerges from particulars like poet's quote and comet's "silent bloom," reweighting entropy without statement; final sweeping benediction offers resonant, non-literal closure. Subtext in vulnerability's "radiant armor" avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person POV stable with perceptual signature (empathizing as "compass"); rhythm modulates from sweeping hush to comet's exhale. Compression purposeful and taught early, enhancing reverence without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with varied rhythm (short emotive sentences at tears: "breath caught... felt the universe exhale"); figurative language consistent in lyric mode, no loops dulling closure. Minor overwriting in star descriptions, but propels accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh janitor-as-mystic transforms entropy tropes via soul-tracing and comet's unrecorded peace; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes of impermanence. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, no hedging.</comment>
