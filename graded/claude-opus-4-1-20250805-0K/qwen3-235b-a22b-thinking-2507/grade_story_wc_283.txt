<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation burns clear from the opening—transforming prophecy from doom to possibility—and this drive intensifies through concrete discovery with the buttons-as-coordinates revelation. The internal contradiction between honoring her mentor's wisdom while forging a new path creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient emotional resolution ("tears pricked her eyes") that could have shown more embodied struggle at the moment of breakthrough.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's reinterpretation of the prophecy, with clear cost implied in the generational failure of previous turners and the coming displacement of the village. The accumulative/textural lens holds as button arrangements gradually reveal meaning, culminating in the coordinates discovery. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines. Slight deduction for the cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber warehouse with its "resinous windows" and "worn floor" constrains Elara's work spatially while the canyon echo jar provides a crucial sensory anchor that guides discovery. The buttons themselves function as micro-setting, their material properties (obsidian, mother-of-pearl, brass) carrying meaning. Deduction for the village below remaining abstract rather than specifically rendered, missing an opportunity to ground the stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing catastrophe through prophecy reinterpretation—establishes early and tightens when the three brass buttons reveal themselves as coordinates. The escalation follows the accumulative lens as each button placement builds toward the revelation. However, the conflict lacks immediate external pressure; Elara works alone without time constraints or opposition, reducing dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of transforming inherited wisdom emerges organically through the button-cataloging method and the mentor's axiom "Buttons remember what voices forget." The final image of Elara descending with a map rather than warnings crystallizes the theme without stating it. The prophecy-as-seed metaphor and the contrast between elders seeing endings while children see paths adds thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with distinctive perceptual signatures like "sunlight bled through high, resinous windows" and "sound like wind through ancient bones." The voice modulates appropriately during the discovery moment. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("unearthed silence," "raw possibility") that slightly strains against the otherwise grounded narrative voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. However, several instances of elevated register ("gilding motes that hung in the unearthed silence") and some redundancy in thematic statements reduce momentum. The phrase "unearthed silence" appears twice, and there's unnecessary scaffolding in explaining the prophecy's dual nature.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of buttons as a forgotten language containing prophecy offers genuine freshness, avoiding typical mystical tropes. The specific transformation of prophecy from doom to navigation map through physical coordinates shows originality. Slight deduction for the somewhat conventional mentor-wisdom framework and the village-in-peril stakes that don't fully capitalize on the unique premise.</comment>
