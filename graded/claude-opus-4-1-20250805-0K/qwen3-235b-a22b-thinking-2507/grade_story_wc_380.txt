<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to recover lost memories is clearly rooted in the tangible wildflowers and drives concrete action through the salt chamber excavation. The internal contradiction between holding onto physical remnants while losing mental ones creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient revelation that his mother had the exact same quest, though the emotional cost of memory loss lands effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered discoveries—whale, gravity pockets, mother's journal—culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where memories transform from lost to "woven into the chamber's luminous fabric." The cost is legible in Aris accepting transformation rather than recovery. Deduction for the slightly mechanical revelation sequence and the convenience of finding his mother's identical research.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber functions as more than setting—its crystalline lattice literally stores memories and constrains Aris's search to a specific excavation point. The gravity pockets create tangible spatial distortion ("ropes float mid-air or sand sink like stone"). Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract treatment of the memory storage mechanism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal memory loss to discovering the systematic nature of "memory wells," with the gravity pockets' increasing pull creating physical urgency. The cost manifests in Aris's acceptance that retrieval means transformation, not restoration. The tightening from random forgetting to targeted excavation to final release works, though the mother's convenient parallel journey slightly undermines earned discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of loss and preservation emerges through concrete particulars—pressed wildflowers as physical memory, salt crystals as memory storage, the whale's deliberate surrender. The final image of memories "woven into the chamber's luminous fabric" offers a non-literal answer about transformation versus recovery. Slight deduction for the overly neat thematic parallel between Aris and his mother.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent lyrical register with distinctive phrases like "drowned in gleaming silence" and "phantom pull that mirrored the hollow ache." The perceptual signature focuses on light, crystalline structures, and gravity distortions. Deduction for occasional overwriting ("vortex where reality thinned like worn fabric") and the somewhat precious tone that occasionally distances from immediate experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the dock-side lanterns suddenly brighter as he walked home through the gleaming silence") with strong sensory specificity. However, figurative density overwhelms in places ("gravity pockets siphoning his past, storing it where the salt grew") and some metaphors strain credibility. The paraphrase loop between "deleted memories" and "lost thoughts" creates minor redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of gravity pockets as "memory wells" offers a fresh angle on memory loss, particularly the physical manifestation through environmental distortion. The integration of whale beaching with memory surrender adds originality. Deduction for the somewhat convenient discovery that his mother had already solved the exact same mystery, which undermines the protagonist's journey.</comment>
