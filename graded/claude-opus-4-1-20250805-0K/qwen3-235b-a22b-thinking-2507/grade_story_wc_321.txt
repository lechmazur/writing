<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leo's motivation to merge timelines is clear and drives concrete actions through radio manipulation and pattern recognition. His "resiliently positive" trait manifests in maintained focus despite the surreal crisis, though internal contradiction could be sharper. The final choice to remain in the grotto shows earned endurance with visible cost ("the work was never done").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns build through starlight reflections, radio frequencies, and temporal anomalies toward Leo successfully merging timelines. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Leo chooses permanent guardianship of the nexus with clear cost ("resiliently positive against the flow"). Orientation anchors who/where/when within first paragraph, and causality holds as Leo's pattern recognition enables the merger.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The spectral grotto functions as more than setting—its tide pools, sideways clocks, and starlight patterns directly enable Leo's solution. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("clocks ran sideways...hands spiraling like trapped moths"). The environment constrains choice by providing the specific geometric map needed for timeline merger.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from ferry dissolution to timeline fracture to permanent guardian duty. Leo's agency drives the resolution through pattern recognition and radio manipulation. The cost is legible: choosing eternal vigilance in the transient space ("Leo remained in the spectral grotto").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "permanent transience"—stability found in accepting perpetual change. The empty hourglass transforms from measuring absence to promising "time remade." Leo's final stance that "every vanishing was a chance to rebuild" offers a resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent urgency with selective perception under stress ("hands trembled not from fear but urgency"). Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally. Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("lattice of light," "liquid starlight") slightly exceeds Leo's deckhand perspective but doesn't obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves momentum with varied sentence structures and clear spatial choreography. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple elements. Minor template cadence appears mid-story ("He heard...then three sharp blasts") and some elevated diction ("ardent," "transience") creates occasional register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of timeline fractures at a spectral grotto nexus offers fresh inflection on disappearance stories. Specific synthesis of nautical setting with temporal mechanics feels earned. The "permanent transient" paradox and Leo's choice to embrace eternal vigilance shows meaningful risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
