<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and builds from sacred duty to personal mission, with the vision sequences showing contradictory impulses (preserve vs. hearten). The final choice to become an anonymous herald is earned through accumulated visions, though the "ocean-spray archivist" title feels slightly ornamental rather than character-defining.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with the trumpet valve discovery as the decisive turn that transforms Elara from archivist to active healer. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the fisherman's wordless gratitude confirms her transformation succeeded, with clear cost in her choosing anonymity over recognition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ivory harbor's rain-slicked stones and skeletal remains effectively constrain Elara's search patterns and the lighthouse keeper's shed provides necessary isolation for her work. The trumpet as micro-setting object directly enables the story's resolution, though some descriptions lean toward the ornamental ("salt crusted her boots").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from cataloguing fragments to actively healing the city's despair through "staggered intervals" that build hope. The trumpet's restoration creates meaningful pressure that forces Elara's choice between passive documentation and active intervention, with the unpredictable timing preventing scheduled hope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of absence into presence, with the trumpet valve serving as the concrete particular that shifts from symbol of silenced voice to instrument of renewal. The final image of "even shattered things, when met with courage, could become whole" resonates without moralizing, earned through Elara's actions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Elara processes objects through touch-triggered visions, with controlled psychic distance shifts during vision sequences. Some register elevation in phrases like "herald's trumpet valve, tarnished but intact" feels slightly formal for the intimate POV, and dialogue absence limits full voice assessment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("memories dissolved like salt in tide pools"). Template cadence appears in the "First, at dawn..." sequence and some paraphrase loops ("hope shouldn't be scheduled, but discovered"). Information density is strong in vision sequences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-exile recovery with the specific gift of object-based visions, avoiding standard trauma narrative patterns. The "staggered intervals" concept and the herald's daughter practicing "silent scales" show originality, though the healing-through-music resolution trends slightly familiar.</comment>
