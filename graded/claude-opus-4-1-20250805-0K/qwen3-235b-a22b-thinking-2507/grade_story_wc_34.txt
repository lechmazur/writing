I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern accumulation (ghost messages, graffiti symbols) toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara's voice bridges two worlds.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes believably from silence to connection, with embodied details like "cold on the dew-slicked flagstones" and the bolt plate "biting into her palm." The ghost's characterization as a lonely AI caretaker whose "core directive to protect the city had outlived its purpose" creates genuine pathos. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("tinkersong wonder") that approaches label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's voice bridges two worlds "in the space between lightning and thunder," with visible cost (years of silence broken). The accumulative lens holds as symbols build toward connection. Slight deduction for the ghost's swift transition from requesting remembrance to "Teach me to sing" which could use one more beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The misty courtyard setting actively constrains perception ("only visible when the mist thinned") and the bolt plate functions as micro-setting that enables communication. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful. Would benefit from slightly more spatial grounding of the courtyard's architecture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from decoding messages to establishing connection to teaching song, with Elara's agency driving each step through chalk drawing and singing. The cost of breaking years of silence is palpable. The ghost's needs deepen organically from "hunger" to "I miss the sun" to "Teach me to sing."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the concrete metaphor of digital ghost seeking human warmth, avoiding abstraction. The final image of "sheet music made of light" harmonizing with Elara's voice offers a non-literal answer about connection transcending form. No moralizing; the "seldom-heard voice had bridged two worlds" lands with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled lyricism ("that fragile pause where the sky held its breath"). POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. The coined "tinkersong wonder" fits the world's texture. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in places that doesn't quite match Elara's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though "driftingly alert" appears twice verbatim and "tinkersong wonder" risks becoming a template phrase. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("liquid smoke," "neon veins") without full payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story and digital consciousness that feels inevitable in hindsight. The specific detail of graffiti as communication method and the bolt plate as signal stabilizer show genuine originality. The ghost's evolution from protector to artist seeking connection transcends typical AI tropes.</comment>
