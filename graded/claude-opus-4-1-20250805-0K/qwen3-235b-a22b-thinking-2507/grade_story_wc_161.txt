<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal contradiction between her forger past and current preservation work drives authentic tension, with embodied details like trembling fingers and the weight on her chest. The final choice to trust Hermes carries earned cost through prior causality. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("the weight of her own deception") and slightly over-articulated self-awareness about trust being "shattered pane she was painstakingly gluing back together."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through dust motes, paper trails, and sensory layering that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara releases control and trusts Hermes. The cost is legible in "the weight on her chest had lifted" and the risk of losing "irreplaceable history." Orientation anchors established early (attic, bookshop, pigeons).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The attic setting constrains choice through the need for "absolute stillness" and the dust motes that teach equilibrium. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (blooming scent of aged paper, dry decay). The Mars meteorite chips' unique sonic property is specific and integrated into action rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving vs. destroying history) escalates through the critical transport task requiring trust in Hermes. The tightening occurs when she must choose between perfect control and releasing the chip to uncertain flight. Cost is visible in the risk to "irreplaceable history, another betrayal echoing her past forgeries."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of trust versus control emerges through concrete particulars: dust mote observation, meteorite handling, pigeon release. The final image of dust "settling gently onto the silent pages" offers resonant answer without stating moral. Strong integration of preservation theme with character's forgery past creating meaningful complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with distinct perceptual signature in how Elara traces dust motes and counts paths. Some register drift into elevated diction ("elegant copperplate forgery," "chaotic paths") that occasionally exceeds character lexicon. Voice modulates appropriately with emotional intensity, particularly in the release moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Several instances of overwriting: "slow ballet of dust motes," "paper trails" appearing three times, some template cadence in middle section ("She'd discovered...She needed...Her method was"). Information density is good but some paraphrase loops around the trust theme reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Mars meteorite chips preserving sonic imprints is a fresh angle on memory preservation. The synthesis of forgery past with preservation future feels specific. However, the trust/redemption arc follows familiar patterns without bold transformation, staying somewhat safe in execution.</comment>
