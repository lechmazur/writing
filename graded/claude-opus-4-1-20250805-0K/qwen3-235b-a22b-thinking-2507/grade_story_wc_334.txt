<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to recover stolen memories drives clear choices, with embodied emotion ("salt-crusted goggles," "tears blurred Aris's vision") and internal contradiction between believing herself robbed versus the gentler truth. The revelation that the witch was a guardian creates earned change with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some explanatory interiority ("she'd learned, ghosts fester in the cracks") that tells rather than embodies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Aris's understanding reprices from theft to protection, with felt emotional cost ("tears blurred Aris's vision behind her mask"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the revelation. Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words. Slight deduction for the cost being primarily emotional rather than showing broader consequences of this knowledge shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid underwater setting with phosphorescent algae, skeletal greenhouse ribs, and shattered glass dome creates atmosphere while constraining Aris's method (studying broken constellations through fragments). The fairy ring's location "nestled among skeletal roots" provides specific spatial grounding that enables the climactic touch. Minor deduction for some catalogue-like description of shipwrecks that doesn't pressure choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from academic curiosity through physical descent to emotional revelation, with the fairy ring touch as the decisive moment that transforms understanding. The "crisp nostalgia" sensory flood creates tangible pressure. However, no meaningful opposition or complication challenges Aris's progress—she simply swims down and touches the mushroom without obstacle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory as both burden and gift emerges through concrete action (touching the mushroom) rather than statement. The witch's transformation from thief to guardian offers non-literal answer to whether trauma should be remembered or forgotten. The "weight of forgiveness" lands without moralizing. Slight deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution where all memories return intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive academic-poetic voice ("skeletal remains," "serpent's spine") with controlled psychic distance and clean free indirect style. Strong perceptual signature in how Aris notices through her folklorist lens. Some register elevation in phrases like "entities who fed on nostalgia" slightly strains the underwater action context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure. Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, several instances of explanatory scaffolding ("she'd learned," "she knew theory meant nothing without touch") and slight overwriting in metaphors ("serpent's spine," "broken teeth") reduce immediacy without pattern-teaching payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The underwater archaeological dive to recover memories offers a fresh angle on trauma and recovery. The broken constellation navigation method is inventive. However, the core premise of witch-stored memories follows familiar fantasy patterns without significant transformation, and the resolution arrives somewhat conveniently.</comment>
