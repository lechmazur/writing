<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in her skeptical-turned-believer arc, with embodied tension in "tears cutting clean paths through the dust on her cheeks." The seventeen-year wait and mission to save citizens from "hollowed minds" provides consistent drive. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("sidereal patience") and limited internal contradiction shown in-scene versus told.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern of breadcrumbs building to the ritual's culmination. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when trapped memories are freed and water returns, with visible cost in seventeen years of waiting. Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words. Minor deduction for some causality softness in how the starlight actually unsticks memories.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful setting details like "moss-clogged stone," "shattered mirrors" in fountain basins, and the stained glass box casting "fractured light" all serve the memory-trap premise. The dry fountains constrain action and the final water return charges the ending. Slightly generic in places ("city of forgotten fountains") but sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's archaeological attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberating memories before city becomes "shell of blank faces") is clear and tightens through the breadcrumb trail to the ritual. The geese's pause creates temporal pressure. Cost is visible in seventeen years waited and emotional release at closure, though the actual conflict lacks active opposition—more quest than struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory/forgetting emerges through concrete imagery of dry fountains and trapped memories rather than abstraction. The "skeptic who'd believed against reason" arc resonates without moralizing. Final image of water flowing through "Aethel's veins like rain" offers non-literal answer about renewal. Some prompt-echo in "sidereal patience" prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with lyrical register ("city of forgotten fountains," "defiant hush") maintained consistently. POV stable in close third. Some elevated diction ("sidereal patience") slightly strains the established register. Perceptual signature shows in how Elara reads the breadcrumbs "not as magic, but as deliberate markers."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though some overwriting appears ("luminous skeptic," "sidereal patience"). Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple purposes. Template cadence in fountain catalog ("Fountain of Whispers...Fountain of Lullabies...Fountain of Regrets") and some abstract phrasing ("psychic sludge") create minor drag. No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The memory-trap concept and breadcrumb quest structure offer solid freshness, particularly the stained glass box containing "liquid starlight." The specific fountain names and their decay states show originality. However, the amnesia-city premise is somewhat familiar, and resolution through magical ritual lacks surprising transformation.</comment>
