I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation toward the final resonant image of dust learning to speak.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—transcribing fragments with "trembling ink," whispering to dust "like incantations." The transformation from copyist precision to teaching dust shows earned progression. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("Tears pricked her eyes") rather than fully embodied response in the peak moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as dust transforms from "inert as forgotten commas" to carriers of story, with clear cost (risk of authorities' wrath, years of patient work). The accumulative structure builds through radio fragments → transcription → dust animation → spreading stories. Slight deduction for the explain-everything quality of "The famine had ended not with fanfare, but with this."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ember alcove and mist create atmospheric pressure, with specific details like "shortwave radio that hummed like a trapped sparrow." The dust itself functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables the central action. However, spatial choreography occasionally blurs (where exactly does she step when "unfurling the sheet").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes build from personal mission to world-changing act as dust begins telling stories. The tension between authorities' Famine Laws and the pirate broadcast creates genuine pressure. The escalation through stronger signal → clearer verse → successful animation works under the accumulative lens, though the resolution lacks a sharper cost or trade-off moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of dust as memory/witness—"dust, the most overlooked witness of history." The piece earns its wisdom about restoration over rebellion through concrete particulars. Minor deduction for the slightly over-explicit thematic statement about "seeding the mist with fragments of hope."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains a literary register appropriate to the premise, with effective modulation ("thistled calm," "spectral broadcasts"). However, some phrases feel overwrought ("fragile counterpoint," "atmospheric ghosts") and the syntax occasionally becomes uniform in its complexity, lacking variation under pressure moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows careful craft but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff ("ember alcove's warmth a fragile counterpoint," "atmospheric ghosts," "hesitant readers"). Some paraphrase loops exist ("dust was telling stories" followed immediately by explanation). The writing is competent but occasionally overwrought, particularly in emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The core concept of teaching dust to tell stories after a "story famine" offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of copyist precision with rebellion through preservation shows originality. The specific detail of dust glowing with the same "secretly luminous blue" as the radio dial creates memorable connectivity.</comment>
