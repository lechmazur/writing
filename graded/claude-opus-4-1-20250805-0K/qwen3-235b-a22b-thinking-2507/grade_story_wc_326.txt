<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in the visceral act of counting heartbeats as defiance against bureaucratic erasure. Her internal contradiction between seeking wisdom from failure while refusing deletion creates genuine tension. The final choice to accept corrupted segments rather than discard them demonstrates earned agency with visible cost—isolation in the frozen observatory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's acceptance of corrupted data revealing the pulsar, with clear cost (isolation after being declared dead). The causal lens holds: static leads to misdiagnosis, which leads to solitary defragmentation, which reveals hidden cosmic truth. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words with "opal observatory," "after the radio static cleared," establishing who/where/when effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The opal observatory's luminous walls and snow-burial create atmospheric pressure that constrains Elara's choices—she cannot leave, must work with broken tools. The porcelain shard and spilled ink become micro-settings that enable her method. Setting doesn't quite reach 9+ because while evocative, it could constrain choices more directly in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal survival (heartbeat counting) through technical challenge (defragmentation) to cosmic discovery (pulsar coordinates). The dominant stake—proving existence against systemic erasure—tightens when the digital ghost emerges. Cost is visible in her isolation and the irony of finding connection to cosmic rhythms while cut off from humanity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor: corrupted data holds wisdom that clean transmission cannot. The parallel between Elara's misdeclared death and the warped signal creates resonance without stating a moral. The final image of listening to her heart "alive in the snow" offers a non-literal answer about finding meaning in collapse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with scientific precision meeting poetic observation ("frost-fringed window," "nebulae" in spilled ink). Some register elevation in metaphorical passages ("refraction, bending truth into new light") slightly strains the POV's naturalistic voice. No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice remains coherent through pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows moments of strong imagery but suffers from occasional overwriting—"luminous green-blue stone beneath three feet of snow" could be tighter. Some conceptual redundancy appears in explaining the death certificate error twice. The "wisdom from failure" construction appears multiple times without variation, creating mild template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of death certificate error with corrupted signal analysis offers a non-obvious parallel that feels earned. Using spilled ink patterns to map defragmentation sequences shows creative problem-solving. The story transforms the "ghost in the machine" trope through specificity—it's the signal itself, not a person, that haunts.</comment>
