I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category against publishability standards.

**Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered memories, sensory details, and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Silas accepts his role as keeper of borrowed memory.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("fingers knotted from decades of salt and wind") and clear motivation rooted in the borrowed memories phenomenon. The contradiction between isolation and connection through inherited memory creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for slight over-articulation in the final third ("eccentric keeper of borrowed light").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis - Silas accepts his role as memory-keeper with visible cost (his isolation now carries another's loss). The accumulative lens holds as memories and observations cohere into understanding. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2. Deduction for slightly mechanical revelation sequence mid-story that briefly disrupts the textural build.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory work ("opal dock shimmering beneath his boots like frozen moonlight") with setting constraining choice - the nautical twilight timing enables the borrowed memories. The Edelweiss functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Minor deduction for one instance of over-written metaphor ("the sky bled indigo").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation of memory fragments that reweight Silas's understanding, forcing him from investigation to acceptance. The dominant stake (honoring the stranger's trust) tightens as memories intensify. Cost is visible in accepting permanent alteration of his solitary life. Slightly mechanical escalation in the middle third prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the Edelweiss as bridge between isolation and connection, home and exile. The final "Danke" and understanding of "gaps as bridges" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Strong subtext in the gesture's dual meaning. Minor deduction for one slightly explicit thematic statement ("bridges, not absences").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled diction ("nautical twilight," "opal dock") and consistent POV. Good perceptual signature in how Silas notices maritime details versus alpine memories. Deduction for occasional register elevation that strains POV credibility ("witnessed isolation," "permanent witness") and some filter verb accumulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is solid. However, several instances of overwriting ("borrowed ache for mountains he'd never see"), template phrasing ("Silas understood"), and abstract descriptors ("quiet dignity") accumulate. The phrase "eccentric keeper of borrowed light" feels forced.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper isolation with borrowed memory concept creates non-obvious emotional territory. The Edelweiss as alpine flower in maritime setting provides specific tension. Transformation of the pointing gesture from warning to offering shows ingenuity. Some safety in the resolution's completeness prevents higher scoring.</comment>
