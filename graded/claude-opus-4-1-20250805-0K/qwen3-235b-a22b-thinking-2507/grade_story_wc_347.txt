<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—grimly fulfilling an oath while seeking freedom—drives consistent action through the piece. Her internal contradiction between duty and resentment manifests in concrete choices (the precise breath-path assembly), though the final wondering about freedom lacks the embodied cost needed for higher bands. The "offhandedly exact" trait shapes her pruning and path-making with specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage (travelers arrive → Elara must guide them → she uses the blueprint method → they escape before frost). Closure achieves Earned Stasis as Elara continues her duty with visible cost ("chains" of the curse), though the final wondering dilutes impact. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cursed orchard and mechanical birds create genuine constraints that shape Elara's tactics—she must use breath-impressions to avoid triggering the birds' detection. Sensory details like "copper wings that whirred and clicked like broken clocks" and the frost forming on stones integrate with action. The acorn and blueprint function as micro-setting that enables the central choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Time pressure (frost deadline) drives escalation as travelers arrive and birds patrol, forcing Elara to act. The breath-path method shows agency under constraint, with visible stakes (travelers' lives, Elara's soul). However, the resolution lacks a decisive cost or trade-off—the travelers escape cleanly and Elara simply continues her duty without transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of duty versus freedom emerges through Elara's actions rather than statement, with the cursed orchard as concrete metaphor. The "graceless beauty" motif appears in both the labyrinth description and Elara's final reflection. However, the ending's wondering about freedom remains abstract rather than offering a resonant answer through image or action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception filtered through Elara's bitter pragmatism ("counted steps and pruning cuts like a penance"). The prose modulates effectively during the breath-path sequence, slowing to match precision. Some filter verbs ("saw them," "wondered if") slightly dull immediacy but remain voice-appropriate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is strong—most lines advance plot while building atmosphere. Minor redundancies appear ("forgotten blueprint" mentioned twice as "forgotten," "offhandedly exact" repeated verbatim) but don't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The breath-path method offers a fresh solution to the guide-without-touching constraint, and mechanical birds as curse guardians avoid typical fantasy tropes. However, the cursed orchard setup and reluctant caretaker bound by oath follow familiar patterns without significant transformation. The specific execution of "whispering the way" provides the story's most original element.</comment>
