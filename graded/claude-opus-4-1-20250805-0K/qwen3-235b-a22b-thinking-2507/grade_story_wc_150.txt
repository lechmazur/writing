Looking at this story through an **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through layered details about roots, bones, and time until the sundial's restoration crystallizes meaning.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions - from practicing phrases to patient wandering to meticulous restoration work. Her "warmly curious" demeanor manifests in how she draws out stories from locals. The final choice to restore the sundial carries visible emotional cost (Kael's tears) and foreclosed path (no longer "adrift").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the sundial's restoration transforms "interrupted journey" into "continuation," with cost visible in Kael's tears and the generational loss acknowledged. The accumulative pattern holds as details about roots/bones/time cohere into the final image of renewed bearing. Minor orientation wobble with "catacomb orchard" concept initially unclear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard setting constrains and enables every choice - from the sundial hidden beneath leaves to the seed-gnomon under ancient roots. Sensory detail ("decaying apples and damp earth") filters through Elara's specific perspective as returnee. The environment literally shapes the restoration through its patterns of light and root placement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from personal restoration desire to communal faith renewal, tightening when the sundial discovery reveals what was lost "when the old ways faded." The cost lands in Kael's tears and the acknowledged generational break. Escalation reads more as accumulative deepening than causal tightening, appropriate to the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sundial becomes a perfect objective correlative for interrupted faith - broken timekeeping mirrors displaced people. The final shadow marking "continuation" rather than "interruption" offers a non-literal answer to the restoration question. Theme emerges entirely through concrete particulars without any moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature in how Elara notices "patterns etched by time" and reads the orchard's "embrace of death." Voice modulates effectively from meditative observation to the crisp "soft, final click." Dialogue carries authentic subtext when Kael reveals generational knowledge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("sandals sinking into the loam"). Some overwrought phrases dilute impact ("cautious enchantment," "promise whispered on the wind"). Minor template cadence in middle section ("She spent days...She learned..."). Information density high in opening and closing thirds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard concept - graves nurturing fruit trees - offers a fresh setting. The sundial-as-faith metaphor transforms a potentially stock "diaspora return" narrative. However, the resolution follows expected patterns without surprising synthesis, and some elements feel workshopped rather than inevitable.</comment>
