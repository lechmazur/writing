I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Hybrid (Causal dominant with Accumulative elements). The story follows a causal chain of Aris discovering false signals, devising a counter-method, and executing it, while accumulating pressure through layered power plays.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and embodied through specific actions (tracing charts, adjusting equipment, calculating frequencies), with internal conflict between hope and desperation. The final choice to face the crowd with proof shows earned agency, though emotional complexity could deepen beyond the cautious hope/determination binary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from signal discovery through subsonic counter-offensive to restored truth, with clear closure (Decisive Change: corrupted signals → pure signal). Cost is visible in the power surge consequences and administrative backlash Aris knows will follow. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The radio station setting actively constrains choices through its aging infrastructure (grounding rods become the solution) and reinforced windows (isolating Aris from protests). Sensory details like "static a constant companion" and vibrations traveling through bedrock create lived-in specificity that shapes the climactic action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from detecting false signals to risking the station's shutdown via power surge, with Aris's agency driving each turn. The triplet pulse discovery leads to the subsonic solution, which triggers alarms that will give administrators ammunition—each consequence narrowing options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus manipulation emerges through parallel terrestrial and cosmic deceptions without explicit moralizing. The final image of Aris raising the chart "against the smoggy sky" while static clears resonates as defiance against noise, though the power plays concept could integrate more deeply beyond thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct academic voice with technical precision ("21-centimeter hydrogen line," "17.3 hertz") that reflects Aris's expertise. Perceptual signature shows in how he reads coffee stains on charts and interprets protests as "faulty receivers," though some phrases like "ethereal grit" feel imposed rather than organic to the POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("protests churned like a faulty receiver") but several template phrases weaken momentum: "familiar weight," "cautiously hopeful" appears twice verbatim, "spark of ethereal grit." The extended compound sentences in paragraphs 2-3 create density without always advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of academic politics with cosmic interference creates an original parallel structure. The subsonic counter-offensive through grounding rods shows inventive problem-solving specific to this setting, though some elements (protests, budget cuts) feel familiar without transformation.</comment>
