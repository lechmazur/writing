I'll evaluate this literary story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through density of emotional geography, pattern breaks in the obituary writing, and a cadence shift that reweights Elara's understanding of healing.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—documenting absence while seeking healing—act simultaneously through her projection practice. The final renunciation of external geography for internal mapping is earned through prior embodied details like "pressing the thread to her palm" and feeling "the hollow where his laughter used to reside." Minor deduction for slight therapy-speak in "emotional cartography" but the cost is viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's realization "the geography wasn't out there" crystallizes with visible cost—she must witness and sit with absence rather than cure it. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through layered obituaries and the thread's evolving significance, culminating in "the map begin to mend." Orientation anchors cleanly by line three.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The crimson thread functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—Elara must physically press it to project presence. Sensory hierarchy reflects her healer's priorities: "the way it caught the dying light, the faint scent of saffron." The garden's "leaves swirling in eddies of wind like unanswered prayers" charges the final image of beginning to mend.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation reads as density increase under the accumulative lens—from tracing leaves to projecting Varek's absence to channeling "the pattern beneath the pain." The meaningful deepening occurs when she revises Varek's obituary from passive description to active navigation: "He sails the harbor of his grief." Cost is legible in "the intimate act...both burden and sacrament."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of writing obituaries for the living—those "physically present yet vanished from themselves." The final realization that healing is "the courage to describe the hollow" offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. The recurring question "Where did you go when you stayed?" gains resonance through specific application to Varek and Silas.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Elara notices through a healer's lens: "veins mapping a silence only she could chart." Voice modulates effectively from clinical precision in obituary drafts to lyrical intensity when projecting. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in "lonesome splendor" and "sacrament" that briefly exceeds the POV's established range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs: "Moonlight silvered the thread's crimson strands, turning it into a vein of frozen blood." Some overwriting in metaphor density during projection sequences ("phantom weight," "silent companion," "house of mirrors") but doesn't obscure closure. Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of writing obituaries for the emotionally absent transforms the familiar grief narrative through specific inflection—the projection practice using a palace thread. The revision of Varek's obituary from description to active navigation shows conceptual evolution. Risk-taking in the lyrical accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
