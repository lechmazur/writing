I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identified: Causal** - The story operates through clear because/therefore linkages: dissonance threatens → Aris must counter-match → he calculates/adapts → achieves harmonic resolution.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and stakes are embodied through physical sensation ("dissonance crawling up his spine," "ache in his molars"). The "logically emotional" attribute manifests credibly as Aris calculates while feeling the Tower's pain. However, the character remains somewhat functional rather than deeply complex - no meaningful internal contradiction or blind spot complicates his path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration - the Tower achieves "sonic absolution" through vibrational matching, with cost visible in Aris's physical exhaustion ("slumped against the cold glass"). The causal chain holds: ice harmonics threaten → key enables counter-frequency → Aris matches vibration → resolution. Orientation anchors early (lighthouse engineer, drift-ice marina, sunset timer).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains through the sunset timer and ice's destructive harmonics. The Tower functions as both setting and instrument, with its "sacred sonic lattice" requiring protection. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("subsonic thrum that vibrated up through the worn planks"). The environment directly shapes the solution method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly: ice groans louder → sunset shrinks → Tower shudders violently → resolution. The sunset timer creates genuine pressure that narrows options. Agency manifests through Aris's precise adaptation rather than force. Cost appears in physical toll and the temporary nature of the solution ("temporary, peaceful stillness").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the harmony/dissonance metaphor - order versus chaos resolved through understanding rather than force. The concept of "sonic absolution" integrates adequately but tends toward the literal. The ending image of the Tower's "enduring, peaceful song" resonates but doesn't fully transcend its immediate context. Some philosophical depth about adaptation versus resistance remains unexplored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with technical precision befitting an engineer ("calculated the required offset," "vibrational matching"). However, it lacks distinctive texture beyond competent description. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("bruised purple at the horizon," "fleshly ethereal glow"). The POV remains stable but doesn't achieve memorable perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from overwriting in places ("azure coat flapping like a wounded bird," multiple descriptive chains). Several template constructions appear ("He felt," "He began," "He adjusted"). The single-paragraph structure creates density issues - no breathing room or visual rhythm. Some redundancy in describing the ice's groaning and the Tower's resonance. Information density is uneven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The sonic/harmonic conceit offers a fresh angle on the man-versus-nature template. The specific solution through "vibrational matching" rather than force shows originality. However, the lighthouse keeper protecting his charge follows familiar patterns. The integration of sound as both mathematics and spirit provides moderate freshness without achieving breakthrough originality.</comment>
