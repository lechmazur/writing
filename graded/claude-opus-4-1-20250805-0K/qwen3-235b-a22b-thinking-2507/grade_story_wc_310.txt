I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered details about coins, static, harmonics, and prophecy toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara discovers alignment through frequency matching.

<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's progression from "stellar doubt" to certainty through concrete discovery of harmonic alignment shows clear motivation. The coins' shift from divination tools to tuning instruments demonstrates character evolution through action. Interiority remains specific ("doubt gnawed," "bones vibrating") without therapy-speak, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where discovering the gold coin's harmonic frequency transforms the colony's relationship with the universe - from survival to synchronized thriving. The backwards prophecy's reinterpretation ("purpose wakes" as resonance) provides conceptual cost. Who/where/when anchored early ("ambered observatory deck," "colony's sole decision maker"). Accumulative lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ambered deck's fossilized resin constrains ritual space and later "glows warmer" in response to alignment. Static bursts function as setting elements that shape Elara's choices. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("coins clattered," "hiss and crackle"). The post-contraction universe setting directly pressures every decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from colony survival to cosmic alignment through Elara's active choices - casting lots, selecting the chaotic burst, adjusting prisms. The gold coin's discovery deepens from random result to universe's tuning fork. Cost is visible in "hours distilling" and the weight of being sole decision-maker, though middle tension could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the paradox of finding purpose through randomness, then discovering order within chaos. The backwards prophecy functions as central metaphor - misread time revealing truth about resonance. Final image of colony lights syncing to frequency offers non-literal answer about alignment versus resistance. No explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent far-future register with specific diction ("dawn-cycle zero," "distillation array"). POV stable throughout with controlled psychic distance. Some phrases edge toward purple ("fractured sky where newborn stars flickered like dying embers") but mostly serve atmosphere. Perceptual signature clear in how Elara processes cosmic phenomena through tactile, musical metaphors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some overwriting in opening ("dying embers after the universe contracts") and occasional abstraction ("wavelength align with purpose"). No significant loops or scaffolding. Final line effectively recharges the prophecy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of divination, cosmic rebirth, and harmonic resonance creates distinctive premise. The backwards prophecy as future-misread-as-present shows genuine ingenuity. Specific details (coins from dead civilizations, static as ghost voices) transform potential clichés. Risk-taking in the conceptual density pays off through concrete dramatization.</comment>
