<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (checking orchids, humming lullabies, mending chimes), with visible cost in her "foxglove regret" and exhaustion. The character makes specific micro-choices under pressure (selecting tuning fork, pressing ear to floor) that reveal her values. Minor deduction for slight emotional summary ("beautiful and aching") rather than pure embodiment in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara preserving three names through increasingly difficult interventions, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she accepts her role as keeper "against the gathering dark." Cost is visible in her exhaustion and the weight of endless work ahead. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3. Slight deduction for the cost being more implied than viscerally felt in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The opal library setting directly constrains Elara's choices—the crystalline acoustics enable her song-based preservation method, while the cracked bamboo tube becomes a tool that "channeled the song's echo better than any intact vessel." Sensory details are selective and purposeful (light refracting in rainbows, liquid gold bathing hands). The environment actively participates in the resolution through sympathetic harmony.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from one cracked chime to "dozens of names still teetered on oblivion," with each preservation requiring deeper effort (humming, then singing fragments, then the full song). The protagonist's agency drives all three preservation acts with visible cost in exhaustion. Deduction for relatively predictable progression without significant reversal or complication that would heighten tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of preserving extinct feelings, with the broken vessel that "still holds songs if you listen right" becoming a resonant metaphor for finding value in damage. The final image of one woman keeping "the dead from being unmade" offers a non-literal answer about the necessity of remembrance. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit framing of "museum of extinct feelings" that borders on theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains a lyrical, elegiac register appropriate to the contemplative protagonist, with selective perception focused on sound and light ("liquid gold," "sapphire"). Perceptual signature is consistent in noticing resonance and decay. Slight deduction for occasional elevated diction ("deserted marvels," "foxglove regret") that, while beautiful, occasionally feels more authorial than character-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm that mirrors the story's musical theme. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for minor repetition ("deserted marvels" appears twice, "foxglove regret" three times) and slight overwriting in figurative language density during quieter moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of a library preserving extinct emotions through glass orchids and wind chimes offers genuine freshness, with specific details like "Kintsugi for the soul" and the broken vessel working better than intact ones providing non-obvious insights. The synthesis of music, memory, and preservation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode heightens the elegiac stakes.</comment>
