I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows a because/therefore chain from Ben's call through Clara's logical proof to her decisive action.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clara's motivation builds cleanly from firing Ben for "reckless idealism" (now "ash in her mouth") through the contradiction proof to her final action breaking her "orbit of regret." The internal conflict between corporate caution and journalistic courage manifests in concrete choices, though peak emotional embodiment could deepen.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from Ben's call through Clara's proof-by-contradiction to her decisive phone call, with visible cost in breaking her regret cycle. The chronometer's dual function (newsroom calibrator/truth anchor) elegantly enables the logical resolution. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost ("orbit of regret" broken, satellite "finally set free").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choice through the chronometer's atomic precision and isolation forcing Clara's solitary reckoning. Sensory detail ("breath fogging the cold eyepiece," rosewood pen "warm against her palm") grounds abstraction. The telescope/satellite imagery charges the final image of truth "hurtling above the clouds."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal reputation through family legacy to journalistic integrity itself. Clara's proof-by-contradiction represents genuine agency narrowing from multiple interpretations to one truth. The cost manifests in confronting her past mistake with Ben and choosing courage over caution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete tension between institutional truth ("Time doesn't lie, Clara. Only people do") and human fallibility. The "orbit of regret" transforms from trapped cycling to broken trajectory. The satellite's final image offers a non-literal answer: truth requires release from comfortable orbits.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains educated precision fitting Clara's heiress-editor status ("decaying orbit," "atomic precision"). Perceptual signature shows through her typographic attention ("misplaced comma," "rosewood pen nib"). Brief dialogue serves plot efficiently, though more subtext could enrich.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose density serves story with lines doing multiple jobs ("velvet sky glittered with stars that seemed to pulse in orbits of regret"). Some figurative density in early paragraphs ("echoing observatory," "satellite trapped," "tightening like a noose") without full payoff. Clean syntax and varied rhythm support momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The proof-by-contradiction method offers a fresh resolution to a journalism-corruption plot. Specific details (chronometer synchronization, timestamp metadata) ground the familiar whistleblower frame. The observatory-as-retreat and astronomy-journalism parallel feel organic rather than forced.</comment>
