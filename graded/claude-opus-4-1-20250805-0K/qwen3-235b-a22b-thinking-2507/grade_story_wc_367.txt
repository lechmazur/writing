<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" drives consistent action, but lacks embodied emotional complexity beyond "shadowed elation." The herald exists more as atmospheric device than pressure-generating character. Internal conflict remains abstract ("doubt slithered in") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara discovers broken light amplifies rather than fails, allowing her to complete her duty. Causality holds through the lighthouse routine, but the "ancient shadows" mechanism and dawn-shaping remain conceptually vague. Cost is implied through the weight of duty and the herald's dissolution, though not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse, glass wick's crystalline structure, and storm-swept coast create vivid atmosphere that constrains Elara's actions. Setting actively pressures choices through the rogue wave that jolts the lantern off-axis. The physical mechanics of total internal reflection ground the fantastical elements effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from routine maintenance to world-threatening failure when the storm disrupts the reflection method. The rogue wave creates genuine reversal requiring Elara to reinterpret "broken light" as amplification. However, the abstract nature of "shaping dawn" and "ancient shadows" dulls the visceral impact of potential failure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of "broken light" from prophecy of failure to method of amplification—using brokenness to mend. The lighthouse keeper's isolation and duty resonate through specific details like the last newspaper's obituaries. Final image of shadows as "loyal ghosts" offers non-literal answer to the story's central question about creation through destruction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "salt-crusted stone" and "shadows pooling at her feet," though occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("twilight into hope"). POV remains stable in close third. Some register elevation feels unmotivated ("sacred duty," "shadowed elation") for a working lighthouse keeper.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose suffers from ornamental density with figurative language in most sentences ("flickering like lightning given voice," "memories of earth's first light"). Template repetition appears in "She knew...She pictured...She recalled" sequence. Abstract phrasing like "weaving twilight into hope" and "condensed memories of earth's first light" obscures concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The concept of a lighthouse keeper who literally shapes dawn through light manipulation offers fresh angle on lighthouse mythology. The transformation of prophetic "broken light" into amplification method shows genuine ingenuity. However, the abstract nature of "ancient shadows" and dawn-shaping mechanics prevents full originality from landing.</comment>
