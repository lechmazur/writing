<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from crisis actor to genuine survivor drives clear motivation, with her trauma and mission creating authentic internal conflict. The encounter with her rescuer forces a concrete choice between maintaining emotional distance and acknowledging truth, paid through the unbinding ritual. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "benevolently ruthless" that lacks full embodiment in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns of gesture and ritual build toward Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara unbinds her journal and acknowledges the man who saved her. The closure lands with visible cost through her shaking hands severing twine and the transformation of the chessboard's meaning. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the whispering gallery setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The whispering gallery functions as active setting through its dome's amplification and the nomadic penumbra that triggers Elara's ritual. Physical details like cold marble, dust patterns, and the fractured oculus constrain her movements and create atmosphere. The blue tile shard creates powerful resonance between setting and memory, though some descriptions remain slightly generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Elara's mission to document gestures through the man's arrival forcing confrontation with suppressed trauma. The penumbra's movement creates temporal pressure, and her choice to unbind the journal carries clear cost in releasing guilt and truth. The progression from observing others to confronting her own buried gesture works well under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between "small gestures" and grand histories, with the missing pawns symbolizing the expendable. The man's tile offering reweights Elara's entire project, revealing her own erasure of crucial human connection. The final image of the empty chessboard as "space waiting to be filled" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency through selective perception focused on body language and architectural details. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("luminous absence," "benevolently ruthless") that slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon. The spelling-words-in-dust device adds distinctive texture, though occasional filter phrases dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong moments like "spelling words into dust" and the tactile unbinding sequence. However, several abstract phrases ("benevolently ruthless focus," "luminous absence") and some repetitive constructions ("She walked," "She wrote") create minor drag. The paraphrase loop around trauma being "real" versus "performance" costs additional clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The crisis actor who survived real disaster offers fresh angle on survivor guilt and performance versus authenticity. Walking patterns that spell words creates original ritual, and the chessboard missing pawns provides non-obvious metaphor for historical erasure. Some conceptual phrases feel slightly derivative of literary fiction conventions.</comment>
