<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action—her numb fingers handling gears, her careful listening for the pulse beneath the stall. The internal conflict between forcing repair versus communion is earned through the prophecy fragments and pays off when she chooses gentle precision over force. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("rhythm of repair") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure—the heart-gear's placement resolves the seized Orrery through earned communion rather than force, with visible cost in Elara's exhaustion and the library's tears. The prophecy method builds causally toward the solution, and the final synchronized reflections create a Resonant Reconfiguration. Slight opacity in the exact mechanics of "uncap" prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen library setting directly constrains choice—ice must be chiseled to reach prophecy fragments, the Hall of Mirrors disorients with temporal splinters, and the Orrery's location demands navigation through treacherous frost. The hauntingly bright eclipse light charges the climactic moment. Environment consistently shapes tactics and enables the final communion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from general repair duty to preventing "perpetual twilight" as the eclipse reaches totality. The pressure tightens when Elara must choose between force and communion, with the prophecy fragments narrowing her options. Cost is visible in her physical exhaustion and the forfeiture of her warmer past, though the exact consequence of failure could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between conquest and communion, with the driftwood nostalgia motif evolving from loss to integration. The final image of synchronized reflections and the library's tears offers a non-literal answer about repair requiring understanding rather than domination. The prophecy fragments avoid didacticism by remaining cryptic until enacted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical compression and selective perception—Elara notices mechanical details and ice formations while filtering through her locksmith expertise. Some register elevation ("cathedral of ice-locked tomes") occasionally strains against the character's practical nature. The prose rhythm effectively modulates between contemplative passages and the urgent climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure. However, several instances of elevated diction ("temporal splinters," "celestial clockwork") and some redundancy in describing the Hall of Mirrors reduce momentum. The paraphrase loop around "rhythm of repair" and "heartbeat within broken gears" triggers minor deduction. Information density is high in most passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The lunar-eclipse locksmith concept offers a fresh angle on repair narratives, avoiding typical confrontation for a communion-based resolution. The frozen library above clouds creates an original setting, though some elements (prophecy scraps, mystical gears) echo familiar fantasy tropes. The specific synthesis of clockwork repair with emotional understanding shows genuine originality.</comment>
