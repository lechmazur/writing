I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through layered imagery, symbolic resonance, and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal turns. The coral-cast parallel, the mist imagery, and the thematic weighting create a density increase that culminates in the exchange between Aris and Mei.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion through the anesthetic's "cottony embrace" and physical details like "fingers traced the cool, knotted surface." The contradiction between Aris's professional competence and vulnerability lands well. Minor deduction for some abstraction in "lotus-hearted ache" and "shared anxieties" that could be more physically grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the coral exchange and Mei's smile that "didn't ache." Cost is visible in "survivor guilt" and the transformation of wounds into testimony. Deduction for slightly abstract handling of the "shared anxieties" and some orientation delay regarding Aris's exact role/location.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The coral fragment and cast function brilliantly as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final exchange. "Mist-clad atrium" creates appropriate atmosphere. The bombed reef memory and physical hospital setting interweave effectively to support the healing theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through layered recognitions - from decoding the cast to understanding shared trauma to the final gift. The stake of "translating pain into understanding" deepens appropriately. Cost is legible in both characters' transformations, though the resolution feels slightly neat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the coral-as-healing metaphor and the act of translation beyond language. The final image of "even broken things could be read, and remade" resonates without stating a moral. Strong integration of physical and thematic elements throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism - "watercolors of indigo and pearl," "fossilized puzzle." POV remains stable and the perceptual signature is consistent. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("lotus-hearted ache") that slightly exceeds the established range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, but several issues: "shrewdly innocent" appears twice identically; some abstract phrasing ("collective fear seeped into his bones"); occasional overwriting in metaphorical density. The "lotus-hearted ache" construction feels forced. Information density is good but uneven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of war trauma and marine biology creates an original healing metaphor. The coral-as-cipher concept and child's encrypted fear map show genuine ingenuity. The specific Pacific conflict-zone setting with pidgin details adds authenticity beyond generic war story templates.</comment>
