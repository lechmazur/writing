I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara shifts from seeking stories to becoming the space where they can grow.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from active seeker to receptive listener is earned through the donor's journal discovery and her realization about "iridescent caution." The internal contradiction between her dye master's instinct to extract and her new heart's rhythm to receive plays out concretely through the morpho wing experiment. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "magnetizing stories" early on.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's shift from chasing stories to "being the calm where wonder could settle" lands with clear cost—she must abandon her extractive dye master instincts. The morpho wing's transformation from potential pigment to daily talisman crystallizes this change. The journal discovery provides clean causality for her insight about listening versus telling.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The floating tea house and valley mist create atmospheric pressure while the morpho wing's iridescent scales become both literal lens and thematic anchor. Sun trails through lattice windows provide concrete physics that drive the discovery. Slight overwriting in places ("cobalt fire," "minuscule stars") but setting consistently shapes choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why people magnetize stories—deepens through the wing experiment leading to the journal discovery, which reframes Elara's entire quest. Cost is visible in her abandoning her extractive approach. The child's question at the end tests her new understanding, though middle sections could tighten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The iridescent caution concept brilliantly unifies physical (morpho wing), emotional (donor's heart), and thematic (holding space without grasping) layers. The final exchange with the child—"By holding the light gently"—offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative. Theme emerges from concrete particulars without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines dye master's technical precision with poetic observation, though some passages drift into overwrought territory ("quietly explosive tension," "cobalt fire"). The child's dialogue feels slightly constructed. POV remains stable and the perceptual signature around color and light is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Several instances of overwriting and abstract phrasing weaken momentum: "magnetize stories" appears multiple times without variation, "quietly explosive" recurs without clear meaning, some metaphors strain ("moths to lantern light"). The prose achieves moments of beauty but needs tightening, particularly in the middle third where reflection dominates action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of heart transplant recipient discovering their donor's secret through butterfly optics offers genuine freshness. The specific detail of using wing scales as a lens to find hidden knowledge transforms familiar elements. Some safety in the resolution's tidiness prevents higher scoring.</comment>
