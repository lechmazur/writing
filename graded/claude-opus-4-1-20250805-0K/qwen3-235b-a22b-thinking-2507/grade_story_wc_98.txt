<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistently driven by her duty to protect collective memory, with embodied stress ("voice tight with urgency," "sweating palm"). The internal conflict between empirical method and "luminous doubt" creates genuine tension throughout. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("empirically whimsical," "volatile, unreliable data points") that slightly distances from immediate embodiment in crisis moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the sapling's growth and memory flood as Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands with visible cost ("wept as the villagers' dreams...wove into a single, unbroken tapestry") and the seed's awakening forecloses the path of cultural amnesia. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established early. Slight deduction for mechanical dream-to-ritual translation that could use more embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ridge's "warm soil fragrant with night-blooming jasmine and crushed moonpetals" creates vivid sensory grounding, and the setting actively pressures choices through monsoon timing. The dreamroot smoke that curls into interpretable shapes effectively merges setting with plot mechanics. Environment constrains the seed-planting location and timing, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, though some descriptions edge toward ornamental ("coral-hued blossoms, the sky's apricot glow").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes clearly established: save collective memory before monsoon destroys the ridge. Meaningful tightening occurs when Elara connects dream interpretation to Lyra's song, narrowing options to this specific ritual. Cost is visible in the final flood of ancestral memories and Elara's weeping. The monsoon deadline creates consistent pressure, though the resolution feels slightly too smooth given the established "luminous doubt."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of empiricism versus faith/tradition emerges organically through Elara's method of "blending data with delirium." The final image of the sapling standing firm while Elara acknowledges "protection was never certain—only tended" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Strong subtext in the dreamroot visions and Lyra's "inherited sorrow." Minor deduction for slightly convenient alignment of all thematic elements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled diction ("reality checker," "empirically whimsical") that maintains consistency. Perceptual signature clear in how Elara interprets physical phenomena through her unique lens. Some register elevation in places ("fragile magic," "resonance validating the song's power") that slightly strains the established voice. No dialogue to evaluate per policy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and good momentum through the discovery-to-ritual sequence. Information density adequate with most lines advancing plot or atmosphere. Deductions for multiple instances of elevated register ("luminous doubt," "empirically whimsical," "resonance validating"), some paraphrase loops ("memory grove"/"collective memory" repetition), and occasional overwriting in descriptive passages that don't directly serve closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of a "reality checker" who verifies truth where "fantasy bled into stone and sea" offers fresh angle on memory preservation. The synthesis of empirical measurement with dream interpretation creates non-obvious approach. However, the core save-the-magical-tree premise follows familiar templates without sufficient transformation through lived detail. The specific inflection of measuring song pitch with tuning fork shows originality within conventional frame.</comment>
