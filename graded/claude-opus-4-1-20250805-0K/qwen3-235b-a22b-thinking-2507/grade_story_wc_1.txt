I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes believably from survival to purpose-seeking through concrete details like the ledger strip and frost patterns. Her artist's eye transferring to tracker mode shows consistent characterization. Deduction for some abstract phrasing ("purpose in the pauses") and slight emotional smoothness in transitions from trauma to investigation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based discovery leading to Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara finds her art co-opted. Orientation anchored early (canyon, night after attack). Cost is visible in the bruise/trauma and the violation of her art being weaponized. Minor deduction for backstory exceeding 20% without sufficient present-frame alteration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Frost patterns function as both setting detail and plot mechanism, constraining Elara's investigation method. The canyon's "drifting resonance" and morning frost traceries create strong atmosphere while advancing action. Physical details like "needle-like ice crystals" and "dry creek bed" ground the abstract investigation in concrete space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from survival to understanding why she was targeted, then deepen when she discovers her art's corruption. The frost patterns melting creates natural time pressure. Deduction for relatively low immediate physical danger after the opening and some convenience in finding the glass vial exactly where needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of finding meaning in quiet moments after violence emerges through frost patterns and investigation method rather than statement. The co-opted art becomes a strong thematic image of creation perverted. Minor deduction for explicit theme phrasing ("purpose in the pauses") appearing multiple times.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature of artist-as-observer with phrases like "luminous glass artistry" and "thin ice crystals adorned." Voice maintains consistency through trauma and investigation. Minor register elevation in places ("ephemeral script," "testament to her refusal") slightly above natural POV range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong specific details. Information density high in investigation sequences. Deductions for repetitive "steadily adaptive" phrase, some abstract phrasing ("drifting resonance" used multiple times), and occasional overwriting in metaphorical language.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass artist investigating smuggling through frost patterns shows originality. The specific method of reading ice crystals as evidence creates memorable investigation technique. Transformation of artistic skills to survival/detective work offers non-obvious angle on thriller elements.</comment>
