<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to reconstruct erased histories through fragment collection is clear and consistent, with internal contradiction between their own erasure and quest for truth. The final choice to become "archivist of the unspoken" carries visible cost through their nameless existence. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("texture of memories") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure where fragments layer into meaning, culminating in Elias's Resonant Reconfiguration as archivist with the cost of permanent namelessness. The poison label discovery and overheard testimonies build density toward the dockworker murder revelation. Slight weakness in cost articulation—while namelessness is established, the specific price of choosing this role could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tidal labyrinth functions as both constraint and enabler—high tide forces retreat while low tide grants access to hidden spaces where stories drift. Vivid sensory detail ("salt crust," "brackish water," "rough grain of salvaged wood") filtered through Elias's unique perception. The container maze shapes every movement and discovery, particularly the poison label wedged in corroded metal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through fragment accumulation: poison label → guard's comment → customs officers → fisherman → sister's testimony, each tightening the murder cover-up narrative. The tide's rhythm creates genuine pressure forcing tactical retreats. Cost is visible in Elias's permanent erasure, though the personal stakes could intensify more dramatically in the final third.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges organically through the parallel between Elias's death certificate error and the dockworker's covered-up murder. The poison label becomes a potent symbol bridging personal and collective erasure. Final image of pressing the label into mud while becoming "archivist of the unspoken" resonates without moralizing, though slightly abstract in places.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("cracked mudflats," "metallic canyon") and consistent perceptual filtering through absence. Dialogue fragments feel authentically overheard and carry crucial plot information. Some register elevation in peak moments ("palimpsests of lives") slightly strains the established voice without clear purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied rhythm, but several abstract constructions dilute immediacy ("texture of memories," "hollow ache of the death certificate error"). Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "Elias [verb]" constructions. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clerical error erasure with tidal maze setting creates an original frame for exploring collective amnesia. The specific 1983 dockside poisoning and fragment-collection method avoid generic treatment. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and abstract elements like memory texture, though execution occasionally favors poetry over clarity.</comment>
