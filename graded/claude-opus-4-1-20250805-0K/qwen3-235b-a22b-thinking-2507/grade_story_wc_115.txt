<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Leo's skepticism creating internal tension against mounting supernatural evidence works well, with his physical engagement with the valve wheel showing embodied choice under pressure. The transformation from skeptic to "keeper of the swallowed truth" feels earned through concrete discovery, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("crushing lightness of a lie") rather than fully embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Leo accepts the role of "keeper" with the valve wheel's weight as visible cost. Causality tracks cleanly from discovery through radio confession to acceptance, though the ghost shift's manifestation feels slightly convenient. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the valve wheel accumulating meaning through beads-as-bones, wetness-as-tears, leading to the final reweighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tunnel's oppressive atmosphere and the valve wheel's tactile details (brass spokes, glass beads, unexpected heft) effectively constrain Leo's choices and charge the final image. Sensory work is selective and purposeful ("cold seepage through his jeans"), with the setting actively shaping Leo's transformation rather than merely hosting it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—confronting truth versus maintaining skepticism—escalates through the valve wheel's increasing weight and the radio confession creating external pressure. The ghost shift's arrival forces Leo's stance crystallization, though the resolution relies somewhat on atmospheric accumulation rather than sharp causal tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of suppressed truth gaining physical weight emerges organically through the valve wheel's transformation and the radio caller's confession. The final image of Leo as "keeper of the swallowed truth" offers resonant closure without stating a moral, though some thematic articulation ("the truth wasn't in the weight of metal...but in the hush after confession") edges toward explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Leo's perceptual signature as a "geologist's focus" shapes how he engages the valve wheel, with voice maintaining consistency through technical observation ("beaded valve wheel," "brass spokes"). The radio dialogue effectively carries subtext about guilt and confession, though some abstract formulations ("crushing lightness") slightly strain the established pragmatic voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose maintains solid momentum with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm shifts between discovery and revelation. Some figurative language becomes overwrought ("ancient throat," "counting bones") and abstract phrases like "measured weight" and "crushing lightness" create mild opacity, though the closure image remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The fusion of industrial disaster with supernatural manifestation through the beaded valve wheel offers a fresh angle on ghost story conventions. The specific detail of beads on an industrial valve creates genuine intrigue, though the resolution into fairly conventional guilt-and-redemption territory doesn't fully capitalize on the premise's originality.</comment>
