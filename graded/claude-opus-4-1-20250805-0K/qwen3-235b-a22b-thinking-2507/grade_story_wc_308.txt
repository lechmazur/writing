<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The harmonic stone skimmer's motivation to "navigate without moving" drives consistent choices through stone-skimming, pattern-reading, and ultimately releasing the arrowhead. His weathered physicality and reverent patience embody decades of pursuit, with the final renunciation (returning the arrowhead) foreclosing his path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns build through stone harmonics, dust motes, starling flights, culminating in the arrowhead discovery that reweights everything. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as he attains navigation-without-movement then returns the arrowhead "for the next seeker," with cost visible in decades spent and path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The canyon of bone towers functions as both setting and instrument—its echoes amplify his stone-skimming, its dust preserves the arrowhead, its verticality frames the starlings' map. The arrowhead itself becomes micro-setting that constrains his final choice, charging the ending image of him "finally home in every place at once."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking silence to reading harmonics to discovering the arrowhead's pulse-compass, with each stage narrowing his options toward stillness. The cost manifests in "centuries of layered dust" on his robes and his ultimate renunciation of the arrowhead after achieving his goal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of navigation-without-movement, where stillness becomes the ultimate journey. The arrowhead's return "as a seed for the next seeker" offers a non-literal answer about wisdom transmission across time, avoiding any stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains reverent, geological tempo through long sentences that mirror the protagonist's patient observation: "Each strike sent a pure tone shivering through the bone towers." The perceptual signature focuses on vibrations, patterns, and resonances consistent with his harmonic practice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves lyric density with lines doing multiple jobs—"centuries of layered dust coating his threadbare robes like a second skin" establishes time, poverty, and burial simultaneously. Some repetition of "pulse" and "pattern" concepts edges toward loop territory but serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of learning navigation through stillness and harmonic resonance offers a fresh angle on the journey archetype. The specific synthesis of bone canyon acoustics with starling flight patterns as living maps creates an organic, non-obvious world logic.</comment>
