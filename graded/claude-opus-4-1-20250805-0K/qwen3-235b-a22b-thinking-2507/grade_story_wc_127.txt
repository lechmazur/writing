<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's contradictory impulses—affectionate detachment versus emerging empathy—act simultaneously in scene, particularly in the grotto's transformation moment where she experiences genuine understanding. The final choice to "leave that space respectfully open" is earned through prior causality with visible cost (abandoning perfected deception). Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("affectionate detachment") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through sensory layering (static electricity, amber glow, vapor) that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lena's understanding shifts from analytical to empathetic. The cost is legible in her decision to abandon perfecting deception. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established within first 60 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto's unique mineral energy and static electricity constrain and enable Lena's work, directly charging the final transformation where environment catalyzes her insight. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (static in molars, amber walls, resinous surface). The setting evolves from workspace to witness of transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation through accumulative pressure as static intensifies, vapor lingers unexpectedly, and the "emergent property" forces Lena to confront the gap between counterfeit and genuine emotion. The cost is visible in her abandoning the perfection of her craft for ethical space. One meaningful deepening that changes knowledge under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete gap between counterfeit and authentic emotion, with the final image offering a non-literal answer: true empathy exists in the space deception cannot fill. The "half-truth" motif constrains choices throughout and charges the closure. Minor deduction for slight abstractness in "fuse insight with empathy."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Lena's professional assessment mode ("top notes of shock, middle swell of despair"). Voice modulates effectively as emotional intensity rises. Some register elevation in peak moments ("emergent property," "inadvertently facilitated") slightly exceeds the established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good information density, but notable issues: redundant phrasing around "half-truth" concept, some abstract emotional labeling ("affectionate detachment" repeated), and elevated diction clusters ("emergent property," "inadvertently facilitated"). Template cadence in middle section with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh angle on emotion-as-commodity through the counterfeit dealer premise, with specific synthesis of fragrance chemistry and limbic system science. The transformation from analytical to empathetic understanding feels earned. Slight deduction for safety in resolution—choosing the ethically comfortable path.</comment>
