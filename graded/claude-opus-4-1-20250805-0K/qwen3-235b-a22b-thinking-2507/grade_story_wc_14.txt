I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inferred: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through sensory accumulation and pattern intensification toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara learns to read time's language through vibration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "collect the textures of different times" drives concrete action through the lamp-charting method, with contradictory impulses (desperation vs. "incandescent restraint") acting simultaneously. The tear response shows embodied emotion under pressure. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "profound, aching connection" without more specific embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elara learning time's language via the lamp's vibration, with emotional cost ("tears pricked"). The accumulative lens holds as density increases from observation to active charting to temporal perception. Deduction for cost being more felt than dramatically visible—the "aching connection" needs sharper consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fluorescent lamp's hum constrains method and enables temporal perception, while bonsai forests create the "blooming labyrinth" that frames discovery. Sensory hierarchy clear: "vibrated in her molars," "fine hairs on her arms stand alert." The phantom cherry blossoms from 1862 Kyoto show setting transcending physical space through vibration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation reads as density increase from silence to vibration to temporal breakthrough, fitting the accumulative lens. The hum's faltering creates reversal that tests commitment. Cost visible in tears and the town's continued silence, though the personal stake could sharpen further against the apocalyptic backdrop.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of preserving "textures of existence" emerges through concrete action—charting vibrations to access "invented histories." The cherry blossom manifestation embodies the concept without stating it. Minor deduction for "profound, aching connection" edging toward abstraction rather than staying fully embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout: "traced a trembling finger," "oppressive hush that pressed against her ears like cotton wool." Rhythm modulates with discovery—shorter phrases during charting, longer during temporal perception. No head-hopping, controlled psychic distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments like "vibrated in her molars" and "cherry blossoms from a spring in Kyoto, 1862." However, abstract phrases accumulate: "profound, aching connection," "gathering the scattered textures of existence," "stationer of moments." Template structure in final paragraph ("She touched... and prepared... The silence... but on the mountaintop") creates predictable cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal collection through vibrational frequencies, with the lamp as unexpected medium. The "gilded-leaf stationer" collecting time's textures shows originality. Slightly limited by reliance on post-apocalyptic frame and some expected beats in the resolution.</comment>
