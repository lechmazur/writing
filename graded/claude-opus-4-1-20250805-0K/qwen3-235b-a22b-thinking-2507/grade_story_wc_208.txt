<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions with driftwood, though her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The transformation from isolation to understanding timewoven alliances feels earned through the magic slide visions, with visible cost in her commitment to honor the sea's chaos.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's final understanding that her art participates in timewoven alliances, with cost visible in her acceptance of the storm's teaching. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through layered visions, though the magic slide's supernatural element slightly weakens causal linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway constrains Mara's choices and the turbine-hum reverie becomes a recurring sensory anchor that charges the final image. Vivid sensory details filter through Mara's sculptor's perspective, particularly in how she perceives wood grain and ocean-carved forms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding her role in ocean-land alliances—deepens through the slide's visions, forcing Mara to reconceptualize her art from creation to reimagining. Cost is visible in her acceptance that she must honor the sea's rage alongside its bounty, though agency is somewhat passive during the vision sequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of driftwood sculpture as participation in timewoven alliances, avoiding direct moralizing. The final image of Mara carving "simplicity from the sea's complexity" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to questions about human relationships with natural forces.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara's perceptual signature as a sculptor shapes what she notices—wood grain, carved forms, ocean patterns—though some passages drift into elevated register ("timewoven alliances binding land and water"). The turbine-hum reverie creates rhythmic control, but occasional template cadence ("She saw... Then came...") dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Information density is uneven with some paraphrase loops ("reimagine" appears 7 times, often restating similar concepts). Strong opening and closing lines anchor the piece, but middle sections contain scaffold phrases like "Mara understood" and "She realized" that could be cut for greater propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide as a window to timewoven alliances offers a fresh angle on artist-nature relationships, though the concept relies somewhat on familiar mystical object tropes. Specific details of driftwood sculpting and the turbine-hum archway setting provide authentic texture.</comment>
