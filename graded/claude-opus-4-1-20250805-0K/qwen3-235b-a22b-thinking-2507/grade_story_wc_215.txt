<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to preserve unspoken words is clear and consistent, with the covenant duty providing causal pressure. The ghost child's appearance creates a micro-choice moment where Silas recommits to his role. However, internal contradiction is told rather than shown through competing impulses, and the emotional progression relies on abstract states ("astonishment settling into resolve") rather than embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Silas's renewed commitment to silence preserves the covenant with visible cost—seventeen years of muteness continues. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of imagery and the ghost child's sign that reweights the box's meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the covenant's mechanics remaining somewhat abstract despite the concrete ghost interactions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland setting directly constrains choice—the ghosts avoid the shed, the box sits in the only standing structure, and the honeycomb-in-dew impossibility charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (translucent ghosts, skeletal hives, trapped fire in glass). The micro-setting of the stained glass box functions as environment, with its fractures telling the covenant's history.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving unspoken words) is signaled early and tightens when the ghost child appears, forcing Silas to interpret her message and renew his commitment. Cost is visible in continued silence and isolation. However, escalation is primarily accumulative rather than causal—the ghost's appearance deepens meaning but doesn't fundamentally narrow options since Silas was already committed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of preservation through silence and the ghosts as visible reminders of the unsaid. The honeycomb-in-dew image offers a non-literal answer about covenant endurance through impossible beauty. The final image reweights prior material—the ghosts aren't trapped but messengers. Minor deduction for the covenant concept remaining somewhat abstract despite concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric distance with selective perception ("tranquilly perceptive recluse") and controlled rhythm. The perceptual signature shows in how Silas reads the box's fractures as narrative. However, some register drift appears ("mute eloquence," "contextual clues") that feels writerly rather than character-driven, and internal thought occasionally explains what's been shown.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong imagery ("ghosts avoided the last standing apiary shed," "cobalt and amber shards") with varied rhythm. However, template repetition appears ("contextual clues" 3x, "tangled covenant" 3x) and some paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("preserve the weight meant honoring what could never be said aloud" restates the prior beat). The "mute eloquence" and similar abstractions create register drift in peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise of visible ghosts as covenant messengers after environmental catastrophe offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic preservation. The specific detail of reading history through glass fractures is original. However, the execution relies on some familiar tropes (silent guardian, mystical covenant) without fully transforming them through lived particulars.</comment>
