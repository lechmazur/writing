I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds density through sensory detail, somatic markers, and the recurring photograph to reach a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elara chooses to continue planting despite erosion and trauma.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's trauma response is viscerally embodied through the freeze state and somatic recovery sequence. The photograph as physical anchor and her deliberate choice to plant despite erosion show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor deduction for slight over-articulation in "penance and purpose."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Earned Stasis closure where continuing to plant despite inevitable erosion carries visible cost. The accumulative build through sensory markers and the photograph's tactile presence creates clear before/after: from freeze to grounded action. The "pearl of stillness" as space within fear rather than absence lands with conceptual precision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cliff-edge setting actively constrains choices through erosion and salt-scoured soil. Sensory hierarchy reflects trauma-altered perception (gull cry triggering memory). The abandoned lighthouse and automated beam create atmospheric pressure without over-symbolizing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation follows accumulative pattern: gull cry → freeze → deepened panic → somatic grounding → return to planting. The cost is legible in "knowing the cliffs eroded steadily" yet choosing to plant anyway. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete tension between erosion and growth without stating a moral. The final image of planting "one more seed in the salt and wind" offers a non-literal answer about persistence within acknowledged futility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how trauma filters sensory input (gull cry becomes drone whine). Controlled modulation from lyric description to visceral panic to grounded resolution. Minor filter verb clusters ("feeling," "catching") slightly dull immediacy in the grounding sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid sensory work, but some redundancy ("trembling hand"/"forced her trembling hand") and filter verb stacking in the somatic sequence. The "penance and purpose" alliteration feels slightly forced. Information density high in descriptive passages but occasionally loops in the internal sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The somatic marker technique for trauma recovery offers fresh specificity. The juxtaposition of automated lighthouse and human tending transforms the abandonment trope. The wedding drone strike grounds the trauma in contemporary specificity rather than generic loss.</comment>
