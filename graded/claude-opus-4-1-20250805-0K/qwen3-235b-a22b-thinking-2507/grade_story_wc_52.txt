<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The widow's grief manifests through embodied contradiction—her hands turning wood while memory pulls backward, creating genuine tension between action and longing. The motivation to "harvest lessons from loss" drives concrete micro-choices: picking up the knife, making the first cut, each stroke a negotiation with absence. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("hollow space," "contain the storm") that could be more viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with crystallized time as its organizing principle, building density through layered sensory detail until the final image of "rust-hued peace" reweights grief as understanding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—she contains loss through the act of carving, with visible cost in tears and the unfinished figure. Deduction for slightly soft causality in how the kettle's whistle functions as transition rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight functions as active setting, creating "liquid pearls" that mirror crystallized time and filter light into "amber waves" that soften pain's edges. The ash wood blank operates as micro-setting with tangible properties—"cool and unyielding"—that constrain her choices and become the vessel for transformation. Minor deduction for some generic grief imagery that doesn't fully exploit the circus-specific world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from holding blank wood to first cut to emerging figure, each action deepening engagement with loss. The kettle's whistle creates temporal pressure, forcing her to choose between continuing work and answering its call. Cost is visible in tears and the "rough but undeniably alive" carving, though the stakes could tighten more dramatically through the middle section.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the carving metaphor—"loss wasn't an end, but a transformation"—without didactic statement until earned through action. The concept of "here and gone" gains complexity as Elias exists simultaneously in sawdust scent and empty chair, in emerging wood figure and beyond it. The final image of rain as "lullaby for rust-hued peace" beautifully reframes grief as presence rather than absence of understanding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with selective perception focused on tactile and temporal details—"beading glass," "cool and unyielding," "shavings curled away like memories." The free indirect style effectively blurs past and present through Elias's remembered words. Some repetitive phrasing around "rust-hued peace" and "crystallized time" prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty—"shavings curled away like memories"—with strong rhythmic control in the carving sequence. However, repetitive structures ("She sat," "She remembered," "She picked up") and some abstract grief language ("contain the uncontainable," "hollow space") create mild momentum drag. The paraphrase loop around "rust-hued peace" appearing three times dulls impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story freshly combines grief narrative with craft metaphor, avoiding widow-story clichés through specific details of lion taming and woodcarving. The "crystallized time" device offers an original approach to temporal suspension during loss. The transformation of ash wood into memory vessel feels earned rather than convenient, though some grief abstractions remain generic.</comment>
