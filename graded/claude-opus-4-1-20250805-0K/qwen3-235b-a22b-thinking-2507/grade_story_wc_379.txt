<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to unlock the mailbox is clear and rooted in her belief that "listening heals the wounds of time," though the community voices dilute individual characterization depth. The collective revelation about Anita creates genuine emotional resonance, but individual neighbors lack distinct psychological complexity beyond their single memories.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through layered memories to a Resonant Reconfiguration where opening the mailbox transforms community understanding. Cost is visible in the tears and collective healing, though the revelation itself feels somewhat convenient. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The courtyard setting provides atmospheric grounding with "dew glistening on bougainvillea vines" and functions as the community's gathering space. However, it doesn't constrain choices or shape tactics beyond providing a meeting location. The mailbox serves as a focal object but the broader environment remains decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on unlocking both the physical mailbox and metaphorical community wounds, with escalation through accumulating memories. The tightening occurs when collective storytelling reveals Anita's true fate, though agency feels distributed rather than driven by Elara's choices. Cost lands in communal tears and healing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of healing through listening emerges organically from the action, with the final image of "the neighborhood found its voice again" resonating without explicit moralizing. The locket-to-letters arc creates meaningful resonance, though "sandstorm calm" feels forced as a recurring motif.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception fitting a curator's attention to objects and their histories. Dialogue differentiates characters minimally through content rather than distinct speech patterns. Some elevated diction ("silent sentinel," "living history") occasionally drifts from the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose flows adequately but suffers from template phrases like "her voice steady," "tears glistened on wrinkled cheeks," and repetitive "sandstorm calm." Information density is moderate with some paraphrase loops around the theme of listening and healing. The final paragraph explicitly states themes rather than trusting the dramatization.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The locked mailbox mystery follows familiar template beats of community secret revealed through collective memory. Fresh elements include the curator's specific worldview about objects holding memories, but execution relies on convenient plotting (finding exact key, neighbors knowing perfect puzzle pieces).</comment>
