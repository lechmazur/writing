<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and builds from personal redemption to community restoration, with concrete embodied tension ("fingers trembled...carefully reckless energy"). The internal conflict between caution and urgency drives meaningful micro-choices through each translation vow. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("raw and urgent") rather than fully embodied states in transitions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural lens with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the translated charter transforms from failure into "bridge between what was lost and what might yet be." Cost is visible through the fragile ink well's survival and voices reclaimed. The orientation anchors (archive, single lamp, dawn deadline) establish clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass ink well functions as micro-setting that constrains choice ("one misstep could shatter it"), and the archive's atmosphere ("dust motes suspended...like frozen constellations") supports the sacred tension. Setting actively shapes tactics through the physical properties of the ink's color changes. Deduction for some generic descriptors ("mountain of untranslated glyphs") that could be more specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as each translation vow builds toward the Veridian Knot's unraveling, with visible cost in risking the fragile ink well. The dawn deadline creates urgency that tightens choices. Minor deduction: the resolution feels slightly convenient as each language connection works perfectly without setback.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "symphonies of truth"—multiple voices harmonizing rather than single meanings. The final image of Elara as "bridge between what was lost and what might yet be" resonantly answers the question of how trust rebuilds without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elara's scholarly POV, with selective perception focused on linguistic details. Some register drift into overly ornate phrasing ("time's relentless tide") that occasionally distances from immediacy. The perceptual signature around color-coded ink reactions is distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("dust motes suspended in the lamplight like frozen constellations") but suffers from repetitive structure in the vow sequences and some overwriting ("carefully reckless" appears twice, abstract phrases like "symphonies of truth"). Template cadence in middle translation sequences ("She began...She moved...She worked") reduces momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of translation as promise-making to dead languages offers fresh angle on the linguist-translator trope. The specific vows ("I will carry your children's laughter into the light") and color-coded ink responses create memorable texture. Slight deduction for safety in resolution—all promises succeed without meaningful complication.</comment>
