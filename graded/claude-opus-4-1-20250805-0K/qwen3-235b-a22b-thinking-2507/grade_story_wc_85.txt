I'll evaluate this story under the Causal drive lens, as it follows a clear because/therefore chain: Silas's past work manufacturing false memories leads to his search for truth, which reveals the watch hand, which exposes his role in Elara's death.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's guilt and need for truth drive coherent action throughout, with embodied details like "tears, hot and long-denied" and the watch hand "biting into his skin." The transformation from denial to acceptance lands with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("weight of unspoken words") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change: Silas discovers his complicity in Elara's death and accepts responsibility, with the watch hand as physical proof. The causal chain holds perfectly—each revelation builds on the previous. Cost is visible in his tears and the sharp metal cutting his palm. Slight deduction for heavy backstory integration, though it's well-anchored to present discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and driftwood fragments create a vivid searching ground, with strong sensory work in "salt-bleached" and "waterlogged." The watch hand discovery is perfectly choreographed. However, the setting doesn't actively constrain choices—it's more backdrop than pressure source.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from general guilt to specific discovery of the watch hand to the crushing realization of direct causality in Elara's death. The internal conflict between self-deception and truth-seeking creates genuine tension. Cost is legible but the conflict is primarily retrospective rather than present-tense pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of manufactured truth versus buried reality emerges organically through concrete action—the physical sifting mirrors the metaphorical search. The watch hand serves as a perfect objective correlative. The ending reweights all prior searching as futile atonement for an irreversible act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent register with phrases like "sieved hush" creating atmosphere, though some passages lean toward overwrought ("bruised twilight sky"). POV control is solid with no head-hopping. Deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't quite match a former black market genealogist's likely lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("salt-bleached driftwood fragments through his calloused fingers"). However, several instances of overwriting: "shades of regret," "vibrant woman extinguished," and redundant phrasing around "weight of unspoken words" used multiple times. The filter verb "remembered" and telling phrases in the middle section slow momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a black market genealogist who manufactures false memories is fresh and specific. The watch hand as hidden evidence creates a clever double revelation. However, the execution follows expected beats once the premise is established—discovery leads to guilt leads to acceptance without surprising turns.</comment>
