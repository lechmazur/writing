<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent throughout, driven by her need to find where unused love is stored. Her interiority is concrete with embodied perception ("fingers trembling," "cold metal"). However, the emotional progression feels somewhat linear without sufficient internal contradiction during the climactic discovery, and the transformation arrives too smoothly without visible struggle at the moment of transfer.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara absorbs the unused love and carries it forward, with visible cost in the building's imminent demolition. The accumulative/textural lens holds as impressions build toward the final revelation. Causality is mostly solid, though the sudden appearance of the crystal in the sound booth feels slightly convenient despite thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setting anchors are established early ("projection booth smelled of dust and decaying celluloid"). The theater space constrains choices effectively through its imminent demolition. However, the physical reality of the "spaces between frames" and the sound booth cavity could be more precisely rendered to ground the metaphysical elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding where unused love is stored) is signaled immediately and the time pressure of demolition provides escalation. The discovery deepens from abstract vision to physical location to embodied transfer. However, the resolution lacks a meaningful trade-off or visible price beyond the building's destruction, which was predetermined.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of film frames holding love in their gaps. The final realization that unused love lives "in the act of remembering, in the spaces we cherish" resonates without moralizing. The recurring motif of forgotten lyrics finding their tune pays off meaningfully in the final line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with controlled, slightly elevated diction appropriate to a crystal gazer's perspective. Perceptual signature is distinct in how Elara processes psychic impressions spatially. Some passages drift toward abstraction ("living geometry of longing") without sufficient grounding, and psychic distance occasionally wavers during key revelations.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose shows good variation in sentence structure and paragraph length. Information density is generally strong, though some passages contain mild redundancy ("unused love" appears 11 times). Lines like "corridors lined with shelves, each holding a glowing orb of unused love, pulsing like a heartbeat" and "living geometry of longing" edge toward purple prose without full payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of love stored in the gaps between film frames offers a fresh synthesis of the physical and metaphysical. The integration of psychometry with cinema history creates originality. However, the resolution's metaphor of carrying love forward in memory, while executed well, doesn't fully transform the familiar trope of preservation through remembrance.</comment>
