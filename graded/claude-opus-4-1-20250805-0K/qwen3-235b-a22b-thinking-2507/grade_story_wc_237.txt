<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's crystallization affliction provides strong embodied emotion and internal conflict, with the physical transformation serving as both obstacle and eventual path to resolution. The character's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, though some interiority edges toward therapy-speak ("scars could be ink, his crystallizing affliction not a curse but a compass"). The transformation from paralyzed scholar to empowered storyteller is earned through specific action on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael transforms his affliction into narrative power with visible cost (the shedding crystals, abandoned ceremony). Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, and the pattern of crystallization-to-dissolution through storytelling holds. The cost is legible in the physical shedding and emotional release, though the resolution feels slightly too neat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating platform constrains choice effectively—Kael must complete his ritual here before dawn. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (luminescent moss, iron kettle, crystalline growth), and the setting's isolation amplifies pressure. The platform's response to his grandmother's superstition ("vibrated faintly beneath him") integrates setting with action, though some descriptions lean generic ("churning storm clouds").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—earning his master's sigil versus being branded a fraud—is signaled early and tightens as crystallization threatens to lock his joints. The escalation follows the textural lens as each rune dissolves more crystals, building toward complete transformation. However, the conflict lacks a meaningful reversal or complication; the solution arrives too smoothly once he begins writing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of scars into stories, with the crow quill serving as a bridge between loss and creation. The ending offers a resonant answer without stating a moral—storytelling as healing emerges through action. The recurring motif of crystallization/dissolution effectively charges the closure, though phrases like "scars could be ink" edge toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with controlled, literary diction appropriate to a rune scholar, and perceptual signature shows in how Kael notices magical/textural details. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the fragile lull where the last thunder faded and the next had not yet gathered") that doesn't fully match the character's stressed state. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments of precision but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "saturated hush" (3 uses) and template structures ("He wrote of...", "the rune for..."). Several sentences restate similar content without added pressure. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work, but others merely elaborate. The filter-verb stack in emotional beats ("remembered," "began to," "seemed to") dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystallization-as-stress response offers a fresh angle on anxiety, and the integration of rune scholarship with personal trauma shows originality. However, the core transformation (writing heals trauma) follows a familiar template without sufficient complication. The specific detail of crystals dissolving into liquid light in the tea bowl provides one memorable image.</comment>
