<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and consistent throughout, driven by her need to excavate truth from comfortable lies. Her sharp observation manifests in concrete actions like noting the stillpoint's coordinates matching Project Verdant archives. The final choice to return the diamond and carry the truth outward shows earned agency with visible cost—she shoulders "the weight of truth heavier than any stone."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal drive lens with because/therefore linkages: Lena investigates anomaly → discovers stillpoint → finds diamond → unearths documents → reconstructs conspiracy → chooses to expose truth. The closure lands as a Decisive Change when she walks "towards the storm, carrying the excavation of truth out of the wasteland," with the cost of bearing this terrible knowledge explicitly felt. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The radioactive wasteland setting directly constrains choices—Lena needs a respirator, the dust storm creates urgency, and the stillpoint's calm enables her document reconstruction. The impossible green orchard amid poisoned land embodies the central paradox. The flawed diamond functions as both object and micro-setting, its facets literally used as "a sorting surface" for reassembly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering truth about the orchards—escalates from curiosity to moral imperative as Lena discovers "the deliberate architecture of their suffering." The tightening occurs when she realizes the liquidation was intentional sacrifice, not accident. Cost manifests in her physical burden of carrying this knowledge and the isolation of walking alone into the storm.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that "comfortable lies were a dam holding back a flood of guilt and greed." The flawed diamond's dual nature—cursed yet essential—mirrors how truth can be both destructive and necessary. The final image of Lena walking into the storm carrying truth resonates without stating a moral, reweighting the opening's desolation as chosen burden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent close third POV with Lena's perceptual signature—scanning for patterns, dismissing superstition, intuiting connections. Some filter verbs ("she intuited," "she understood") slightly dull immediacy in crucial moments. The prose modulates effectively from descriptive opening to tense document reconstruction to weighted final decision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments like "ochre clouds swallowing the dying sun" but suffers from repetitive structures ("She scanned," "She knelt," "She carefully placed"). Several paraphrase loops appear: "comfortable lies" echoes multiple times without variation, and "excavate truth from those lies" restates the motivation redundantly. Information density is uneven, with some passages over-explaining what's already shown.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The conspiracy debunker investigating post-apocalyptic anomalies offers a fresh angle on wasteland fiction. The specific detail of using a flawed diamond's facets as a sorting surface for shredded documents shows ingenuity. The revelation that terraforming succeeded too well, requiring deliberate economic collapse as cover-up, transforms expected dystopian tropes.</comment>
