<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode temple inscriptions before monsoon rains provides clear urgency, and her internal conflict between solitary burden and communal understanding drives meaningful change. The dream sequence reveals contradictory impulses through embodied detail ("heart hammering," "tears pricked"), though some moments drift toward therapeutic insight ("healing began when burdens were distributed") rather than staying in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: The story builds through dream-vision-revelation pattern, with the daylily telegram recurring as a physical anchor that reweights from loss to connection. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara transforms from isolated seeker to communal witness, with visible cost in Kael's absence becoming presence ("his spirit woven into the very stones"). The "We lift together" inscription crystallizes this shift with earned emotional weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The observatory and temple settings constrain choices effectively—the variable stars' timing creates urgency, and the dream-temple's shadowed sanctum enables the vision. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("stars pulsing like distant heartbeats," "moonlight slicing through cracked stone"), though the desert location could be more specifically grounded to elevate atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to decode inscriptions toward understanding collective burden-sharing, with the monsoon deadline and Kael's three-year absence creating persistent pressure. The variable star Rho Lyrae entering its bright phase provides the crucial tightening that forces revelation, though the resolution could show more immediate cost beyond emotional recognition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete discovery that "Carry not alone" encodes both astronomical patterns and human truth about shared burdens. The daylily's transformation from preservation gesture to promise, and the temple's message shifting from riddle to lifeline, creates layered resonance without stating morals. The final image of Elara as witness holding collective wisdom lands with earned weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with astronomical precision ("Cepheid variables," "spectrograph") balanced against emotional specificity. The dream sequence shifts psychic distance effectively, and free indirect style stays clean throughout. Some moments edge toward elevated diction ("midnight solace," "celestial code") that slightly exceeds the character's established register under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and information density, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("healing began when burdens were distributed"/"healing began when one voice became many"), and abstract formulations like "quiet communion across time" lack the concrete specificity of stronger passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of astronomy, archaeology, and lucid dreaming creates fresh angle on the mentor-loss narrative, with variable stars as prayer-cipher showing genuine originality. The specific detail of pressing flowers into telegrams and the dream-laborers passing the daylily across time elevates beyond template, though some thematic statements ("Trust the rhythm") feel familiar.</comment>
