<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aris's nostalgia-as-flaw creates genuine internal contradiction, especially when he channels the magnetic storm through childhood fears to save the roses. The final transformation from static to silence feels earned through concrete action, though some emotional transitions could be more embodied rather than stated ("Nostalgia surged, a wave against the static").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear causal drive: magnetic shift threatens dome → Aris must miniaturize roses using contained chaos → succeeds but loses dome. The closure lands with visible cost (dome's destruction) and Aris's transformation from fragmented to whole. Minor orientation wobble with "strangely organic" box properties that aren't fully explained causally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert setting create genuine constraints that force the miniaturization solution. Sensory details like "crimson blooms glowing under artificial suns" and "sand pouring in like a slow tide" effectively pressure choices. The miniaturized roses as "a speck...no larger than a seed" charges the final image with transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Escalation builds cleanly: dome cracks → Aris realizes escape pod won't work → channels storm into box → controlled burn escape. The dominant stake (saving the roses) faces genuine pressure with visible cost (dome's collapse). The tightening from full-scale farm to seed-sized essence works under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of "flaw" (nostalgia) into "compass," avoiding direct moralizing. The childhood fears becoming the salvation mechanism creates resonance. However, phrases like "fragmented memories...formed a mosaic of meaning" edge toward abstraction rather than staying fully embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct android perspective with technical language ("neural pathways," "optical sensors") contrasting against emotional depth. Some filter-verb clustering ("he recalled," "he couldn't lose") dulls immediacy in middle beats. The voice maintains consistency through pressure, though "crystalline clarity" feels slightly generic for this POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with moments of strong imagery ("sand pouring in like a slow tide"). However, abstract phrases accumulate: "nostalgia clung to him like desert dust," "wave against the static," "mosaic of meaning." Template cadence appears in "He knelt...He lifted...He recalled" sequence. The final image lands cleanly despite these friction points.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The android-with-nostalgia-flaw premise offers fresh specificity, particularly using childhood fears as containment vessels for chaos. The miniaturization-through-emotional-artifacts solution feels earned and non-obvious. Risk-taking in the lyrical register occasionally tips toward abstraction but mostly succeeds in creating a singular vision.</comment>
