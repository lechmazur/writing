<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's reckless idealism drives genuine stakes through her bartered destiny, with contradictory impulses ("fiercely gentle") embodied in concrete actions like tending the burned card while carving binding symbols. The final choice to accept root-binding shows earned cost, though some interiority edges toward overwrought ("the silence where her brother's laughter should be was a wound that festered in the marrow").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds through layered imagery toward Elara's transformation into "keeper of thresholds herself," with visible cost in her physical binding. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where she accepts imprisonment to maintain her brother's life, though the price mechanism could be more explicit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard setting actively constrains choices—roots "thick as serpents" become literal bonds, skulls hold rainwater for ritual use, and the space transforms from passive backdrop to active antagonist. Sensory details ("damp earth and the ghost of burnt sage") filter through Elara's desperate focus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from carving symbols to physical entrapment as roots respond with "sudden, muscular trammel," forcing Elara's acceptance of permanent binding. The cost is legible in her transformation from seeker to trapped keeper, though the middle section could tighten the pressure buildup.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of mending by accepting wounds—Elara cannot "patch the hole" but can "hold the space between." The final humming of the unbartered lullaby offers resonant answer to the central question of what remains when futures are traded, avoiding explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains gothic density with controlled rhythm ("thick as serpents, coiled between jumbled femurs") and character-specific perception. Some overwrought moments ("dusky resolve settling over her like a shroud") slightly strain credibility, but the final shift to simple humming effectively modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves atmospheric density but occasionally tips into overwriting ("the silence where her brother's laughter should be was a wound that festered in the marrow"). Strong syntactic variety and propulsive imagery, though some metaphor vehicles strain coherence ("roots...with quiet hunger").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tarot symbolism with visceral body horror creates memorable atmosphere. The specific detail of carving meaning into grave-mold-slick roots while binding destiny through physical materials transforms familiar magical bargain tropes, though some elements feel Gothic-template familiar.</comment>
