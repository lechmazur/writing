I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and symbolic resonance rather than strict causality, with density increasing toward the eclipse moment and closure achieved through pattern and reweighting.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions with the flute and curl. Leo's transformation from terror to wonder is earned through specific dramatized moments. However, some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("ordinary magic," "softly adaptive resilience") rather than fully embodied perception, and the father remains underdeveloped beyond his stress marker.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Leo shifts from "sun dying" to "hiding to show us something new," with visible cost in his initial terror and the father's emotional response. The accumulative lens holds as imagery builds toward the eclipse moment. However, the cost could be more sharply defined - the transformation feels slightly too smooth without sufficient resistance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sage Ridge functions as more than backdrop - the ridge's "quiet exhale," sagebrush, and eclipse-transformed landscape actively shape the encounter. The baby curl as micro-setting constrains and enables connection. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, particularly the "water finding its path" flute sound and silver-illuminated sagebrush during totality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake - nurturing wonder against modern anxiety - is signaled early and tested through Leo's fear. The eclipse provides natural escalation, and Leo's transformation represents a meaningful deepening. However, the resolution lacks sufficient resistance; Leo's shift happens too readily without intermediate struggle that would heighten the cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete interaction between Elara and Leo, avoiding direct moralizing until Leo's realization. The curl as "wonder compass" and bridge between generations creates resonance without heavy-handedness. The final image of Leo taking sage as his own keepsake effectively reweights the opening setup. Minor deduction for "ordinary magic" appearing too frequently as a conceptual label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception fitting a music therapist, and the prose modulates appropriately during the eclipse. However, abstract phrases like "softly adaptive resilience" and "ordinary magic" create register drift that doesn't fully match the otherwise grounded narration. The limited dialogue feels natural but doesn't fully distinguish the speakers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops diminish momentum: "ordinary magic" appears five times, "softly adaptive" four times without variation. Template phrasing like "beneath the hush of dreaming roots" bookends without earning its repetition. The prose has moments of clarity but suffers from abstract descriptors ("cautiously exuberant," "gently insistent") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The eclipse-as-therapeutic-moment offers a fresh angle on both natural phenomena and healing. The baby curl as intergenerational talisman is specific and memorable. However, the therapist-helps-anxious-child framework is somewhat familiar, and the transformation could push further into unexpected territory rather than resolving into anticipated wonder.</comment>
