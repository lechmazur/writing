<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between Liam's need to insulate with facts and his visceral longing for belonging drives the narrative. The moment where he stops insulating and allows the grille cloth's true meaning to surface shows genuine internal conflict acting in scene. His final choice to keep the cloth rather than appraise it as "minimal value" carries visible cost—professional duty versus personal truth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Liam reframes the quarry's emptiness from dirge to "call to listen deeper," with the grille cloth becoming compass rather than trash. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details (thread count, blue tint, heat damage) accumulate to reweight his understanding of purpose. Cost is legible in his choice to abandon professional appraisal for personal meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The quarry's vast emptiness functions as external mirror to Liam's internal hollow, constraining his emotional options throughout. Specific details like "12x12 thread count" and "blue stage gel permanently soaked into fibers" ground the piece in tactile reality. The grille cloth's physical properties (puckering from Maya's mic stand) directly charge the final image of Liam walking toward the pit edge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure escalates from professional evaluation to personal reckoning as the grille cloth's true history surfaces, forcing Liam to choose between appraiser role and authentic self. The tightening occurs when facts blur into memories, narrowing his options to either maintain professional distance or reclaim personal meaning. Cost is visible in his abandonment of the appraisal form for the worn compass.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of finding music in aftermath emerges organically through the grille cloth's transformation from "minimal value" artifact to "map of their final tour." The echo valley metaphor deepens from empty space to resonant potential without explicit moralizing. The final image of walking toward the pit with "space waiting for the next note" offers a non-literal answer to the question of purpose after failure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shows in Liam's roadie-specific noticing ("Thread count: 12x12 per inch," "ozone and stale beer"). Voice modulates effectively from clinical appraisal language to raw memory ("Fix it, Liam...Or just hold onto it"). The technical vocabulary around sound equipment and stage elements remains consistent with his professional background throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly "confidently uncertain" which captures both his professional stance and emotional state. Some repetition exists around "echo valley" and "silence/quiet" but functions as pattern-teaching for the accumulative design. Minor scaffold appears in "He wouldn't list it as minimal value. He'd keep it" which could be compressed to single action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of roadie expertise with appraisal work creates fresh angle on loss and recovery, avoiding typical grief narratives. The specific detail of stage gel creating permanent blue tint transforms a mundane object into charged relic. The quarry setting as aftermath space for a music professional shows non-obvious juxtaposition that feels earned.</comment>
