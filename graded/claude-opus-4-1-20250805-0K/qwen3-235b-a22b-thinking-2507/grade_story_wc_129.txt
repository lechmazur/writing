<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—the "luminescent ache" to belong—is embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices, particularly her decision to join the search and create the final sculpture. The revelation that Weaver is the community itself earns her transformation from outsider to "thread in its enduring weave," with visible cost in her vulnerability and three days of labor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the tag discoveries until the final revelation reweights everything—the community itself is Weaver. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara's sculpture transforms her from grafting onto community to becoming integral to it, with cost visible in her tears and trembling hands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and shimmering crater create a vivid, otherworldly setting that constrains choices—Elara must work with marsh reeds that "dissolve with the next rain," emphasizing fragility. The obsidian arbor functions as crucial setting in the closure, its black glass fracturing light into rainbows that mirror the community's web.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's need for belonging—escalates through each tag discovery, tightening from solitary searching to collective gathering at the arbor. The revelation that there is no single Weaver forces a meaningful reconfiguration, though the conflict could push harder against Elara's initial assumptions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of weaving—from Elara's fragile reed birds to the tags' "interlocking hands" to her final web sculpture. The ending offers a resonant answer without stating a moral: community isn't found but actively woven "one fragile, beautiful strand at a time."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with controlled rhythm ("their branches heavy with translucent fruit, cast prismatic shards"), though occasional filter phrases like "She realized" and "She understood then" slightly dull immediacy. The perceptual signature—focusing on light, weaving, and connection—remains character-specific throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptions like "the crater's murmur was no longer a sound of loss but a lullaby for the living." Some paraphrase loops appear ("luminescent ache" variations) and filter verbs cluster in revelation moments, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of community as collective artist rather than individual transforms the expected "find the mysterious artist" trope meaningfully. The synthesis of marsh-reed fragility with permanent community bonds creates fresh resonance, though the revelation structure itself follows familiar patterns.</comment>
