<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's internal conflict between duty to public safety and preservation of sacred ruins creates genuine tension, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (trembling from both fatigue and "the sheer weight of conflicting duties"). The discovery of Elara's hidden solution earns the final choice through clear causality, though the emotional progression could deepen further under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal lens with Aris discovering Elara's encrypted message that reveals the hidden bypass channel, leading to a Decisive Change where Aris chooses to activate the secret system. The closure lands with visible cost (sacrificing rigid protocols, risking reputation like Elara) and the "quiet certainty of a path finally seen" crystallizes the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The volcanic amphitheater setting directly constrains choices through its structural decay and thermal pulses, with the hidden bypass channel through the volcano's "stable central spire" becoming essential to resolution. Sensory details like "warm, mineral-scented air" and the "metallic *clink*" of the surveyor's chain create vivid immediacy, though some descriptions edge toward density without always advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preventing reservoir breach while preserving the ruins) escalates through Aris's discovery of the hidden channel, forcing a choice between following orders and trusting Elara's radical solution. The cost is legible in Aris choosing to "speak for Elara's silent compassion" over "modern, rigid protocols," though the external pressure of the imminent monsoon could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of harmonizing conflicting values emerges through Elara's "encrypted compassion" and her sacrifice of reputation for a solution that protects both city and caldera. The final image of Aris feeling "the mountain's ancient pulse sync with their own determined heartbeat" offers a resonant answer about engineering "not just water flow, but a fragile, necessary peace."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with distinct perceptual signature ("calculating water pressure tolerances against structural decay"). Some passages drift toward elevated register ("dappled resolve," "slyly heartfelt audacity") that slightly strains the machinist's practical lexicon, though the rhythm effectively modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Several instances of overwriting dilute momentum: "slyly heartfelt audacity," "fragile, necessary peace," and abstract phrases like "harmonized conflicting values." Template cadence appears in "Aris understood...Aris's breath hitched...Aris placed" sequence, and some metaphors strain ("surveyor's chain...felt like a lifeline to Elara's intent").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of "encrypted compassion" hidden in chemical reactions offers a fresh angle on the engineering-versus-preservation conflict. The hidden bypass channel designed through the volcano's heart rather than against its walls shows ingenuity, though some elements (the convenient envelope discovery) feel slightly contrived.</comment>
