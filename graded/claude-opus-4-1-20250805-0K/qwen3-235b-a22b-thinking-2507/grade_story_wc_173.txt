<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation burns with clarity from the opening, and her embodied actions—fingers tracing threads, spine arching as "living sonnet"—reveal character through physicality rather than labels. The "chaste courtesan" contradiction works as genuine internal tension, not ornamental paradox. Minor deduction for the mother's voice backstory feeling slightly convenient, though it does anchor her resolve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the city awakens with "raw, beautiful chaos" replacing the lullaby's control, and Elara pays the cost of her "fragile safety." The piece teaches its pattern early (poetry as rebellion, threads as trapped voices) and lands with visible transformation. Slight softness in the middle where the untangling mechanics could tighten causally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary functions as both setting and constraint—its threads must be untangled with "absolute precision" or shatter into silence, directly shaping Elara's careful choreography. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "snow whispering," "frozen music," "luminous strands." The courtyard's "alarming serenity" tensions perfectly against the rebellion, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each untangled thread releases echoes that fray the lullaby's drone, culminating in the "full harvest" that shatters control. The central knot from the founding queen provides meaningful deepening. Cost is legible—Elara sacrifices her protected station, and the lullaby's resistance "threatening to strangle" creates genuine stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of harvested voices and bodily poetry as rebellion—never stated but embodied in every movement. The final image of "first footprints of a new day" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the opening's "untouched skirts" from purity to agency. Subtext operates beautifully through "weaponized grace" and silence as "loudest defiance."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature filters everything through Elara's poetic sensibility—threads become "stanzas," movement becomes "sonnet," the courtyard reads as "tableau." Voice maintains lyric elevation consistently without drift. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("crystalline silence") that slightly exceeds the established range, though it serves the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"snow whispering against her untouched skirts" establishes setting, character, and tone simultaneously. Some figurative density in peak beats ("living sonnet written in motion") approaches overwriting but stays pattern-consistent. Deduction for template cadence in the resolution sequence ("She had not sung...," "As dawn tinged...," "No lullaby would...") and slight abstraction in "raw, beautiful chaos."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of courtesan-as-poet and silence-as-rebellion offers genuine freshness, transforming the expected seduction narrative into bodily resistance through grace. The harvest of echoes concept avoids generic rebellion, creating specific world-logic. Risk-taking in the lyric mode and sustained metaphor of threads/music/poetry shows commitment without gimmickry.</comment>
