<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to discover hidden secrets drives consistent choices throughout, with his gift of seeing ghosts creating genuine internal complexity. The final act of releasing Thorn's spirit through the mainspring demonstrates earned character agency with visible cost—the "weightless burden" easing represents genuine change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition (dust, cracks, hidden objects) building toward Thorn's release—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the clockwork bird's activation frees the ghost. Cost is legible in Thorn's decades of entrapment and the "quiet sorrow" Silas carries. Minor orientation lag (circus context emerges gradually) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned circus setting effectively constrains discovery through decay patterns and hidden compartments, with dust accumulation serving as a micro-setting that reveals temporal disturbance. The clockwork bird and mainspring barrel function as setting elements that enable the final resolution, though some descriptive passages ("skeletal frame," "tomblike air") lean generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity about ceiling secrets to releasing a trapped spirit, with the mainspring discovery narrowing options toward resolution. The dust patterns → drawer → key → compartment sequence creates coherent pressure under the accumulative lens, though the ghost's appearance could have introduced more complication before resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of "cracks in the façade"—both literal architectural fissures and temporal bleeding between past/present. The clockwork bird missing its mainspring resonates as an image of incompletion seeking resolution, and the final release reweights earlier observations about hidden secrets without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical precision befitting an elevator technician's observational skills, with specialized vocabulary (horologist, mainspring barrel) grounding authenticity. Some filter-heavy constructions ("Silas felt," "He recognized," "Silas understood") and occasional register elevation ("tomblike air," "weightless burden") create minor friction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks, though several metaphorical reaches strain ("holding smoke," "thin places where past bled into present"). Template constructions appear in the ghost interaction sequence ("Thorn's ghost drifted," "Thorn's story unfolded," "Thorn's ghost smiled") creating cadence monotony that dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of elevator technician expertise with ghost-seeing ability creates a non-obvious angle on paranormal investigation, grounded in technical observation rather than mysticism. The specific detail of dust accumulation patterns revealing temporal disturbance shows genuine ingenuity, though the ghost-helps-find-object resolution follows familiar patterns.</comment>
