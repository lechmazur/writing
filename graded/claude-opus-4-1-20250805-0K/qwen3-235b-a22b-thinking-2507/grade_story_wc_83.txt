<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's grief-driven hunt for meaning crystallizes in contradictory impulses—clutching the dead geode while desperately believing in preserved potential. His motivation deepens from loss to purpose when the geode erupts with Elara's presence, earning the final choice to map all pools through visceral cost ("tears evaporating in the geode's warmth").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the geode's transformation from "cold and dead" to pulsing with Elara's presence, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Aris discovers stolen futures aren't gone but pooled. The cost lands explicitly: "broken man held a piece of his dead love" while choosing to hunt all pools, though the orientation anchors arrive slightly late (~150 words).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains through cooling circuit breakers that force Aris to use auxiliary systems, enabling his discovery. The geode functions as micro-setting, warming unnaturally then erupting with presence, while Helios's indifferent storms contrast the "fragile bubble of light" where hope pools.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through the geode's progression from cold object to warm sensor to erupting with Elara's tangible presence, forcing Aris to confront "the bleakness of his loss" intertwined with "exhilaration" at proof. The cost is unmistakable when he chooses to map all pools while "tears evaporating in the geode's warmth."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the geode's transformation and the discovery that "unused potential pools in the universe's silent voids," avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of Aris logging coordinates while holding his dead love's crystal reweights loss as purpose, though some passages edge toward abstraction ("intangibly tangible" repetition).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency through technical precision ("perturbation theory," "auxiliary harmonics") filtered through grief-tinged perception. Some register elevation occurs ("intangibly tangible presence") but serves the moment of discovery, and the perceptual signature holds through pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but "intangibly tangible" appears four times creating repetitive patterning. Some elevated diction ("voids," "manifesting") occasionally drifts from immediate embodiment, and filter constructions ("He remembered," "Aris recalled") accumulate in the middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of hunting cosmic pools where stolen potential gathers offers a fresh synthesis of grief and discovery. The specific integration of perturbation theory with the geode sensor creates an inevitable-feeling revelation, though the "intangibly tangible" concept risks abstraction.</comment>
