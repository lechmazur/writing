<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve wonder through physical craft is embodied convincingly, with her seasonal muteness creating genuine constraint that shapes her choices. The transition from voice to silence drives urgency in her work, though internal contradiction could be sharper during the installation sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure as the community absorbs the "color of wonder" through bone and light, with Elara's impending muteness providing visible cost. The resonant reconfiguration lands cleanly: wonder transforms from abstract concept to embodied vibration carried in the community's bones.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Whispering Bluff and kinetic sculptures constrain Elara's method meaningfully—she must work through wind and metal rather than words. The iceberg fragment's prismatic light becoming "a promise against the gathering dark" charges the final image with environmental specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the narrowing window between autumn's wordlessness and winter's muteness, forcing Elara to complete her work in this liminal moment. The community's gathering and physical response to the symphony demonstrates tangible impact, though a sharper mid-story tightening would strengthen escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the ice fragment's transformation from relic to living instrument, with wonder made tangible as "vibration felt, a shared heartbeat in the wind." The final image of the community carrying color "in their bones, where no silence could erase it" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("bone through the cloud sea") and consistent POV modulation as Elara moves from technical precision to emotional witness. Some filter-verb clustering in the middle diminishes immediacy ("She worked with muted vigor"), but perceptual signature remains strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some paraphrase loops appear ("glisten of the iceberg fragment intensified" repeated conceptually). Strong opening and closing lines, but "symphony of truth" and similar abstractions occasionally drift toward template phrasing in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate grief with synaesthetic preservation of wonder, avoiding obvious eco-fiction tropes. The specific mechanism of translating ice memory into communal vibration through wind sculpture offers genuine originality, though some metaphors ("bone through the cloud sea") echo familiar imagery.</comment>
