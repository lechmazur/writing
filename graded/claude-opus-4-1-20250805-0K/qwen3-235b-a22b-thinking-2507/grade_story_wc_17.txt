<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and character-specific (hearing whispers in stone), with embodied perception throughout. The final choice to carry forward Thorne's message shows earned change with visible cost. However, Thorne exists only as discovered material rather than active pressure, and some interiority slides toward diagnostic label-speak ("spiritual fracture," "legacy's burden").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through discovered artifacts leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias reframes his mission from mapping echoes to carrying testimony. Cost is legible in Thorne's burned work and abandoned warnings. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay (corridor location unclear until "university building") and some causality softness in how the resonator's readings translate to specific visions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory detail filters through Elias's specialized perception (vibrations, echoes, resonator readings). The ruined university setting constrains his search and the film negative physically enables his final understanding. However, the ivy-veiled passage itself doesn't sufficiently pressure choices beyond providing atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering what walls dream about) evolves through textural accumulation as Elias uncovers Thorne's materials, culminating in his resolve to carry forward the testimony. The deepening from acoustic mapping to moral witness shows clear progression. Cost appears in Thorne's shame and the "legacy's burden," though protagonist agency remains mostly observational rather than facing active opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through discovered artifacts: walls absorb human despair rather than dream, and legacy compels rather than crushes. The film negative serves as a concrete image that reweights prior material. Minor deduction for explicit thematic statements ("Legacy's burden wasn't meant to crush but to compel") that edge toward thesis articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elias's synesthetic ability to hear stone whispers and feel vibrations. Prose modulates with discovery beats, particularly when handling the artifacts. Some register drift into elevated diction ("crystallized in silver halide") and occasional filter verb clusters dilute immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid specific details ("brass resonator," "water-swollen leather"). Information density is moderate with some purposeful description. Deductions for template cadence runs ("He knelt...He carefully pried...He saw"), paraphrase loops around the "legacy's burden" concept, and elevated register that occasionally breaks POV lexicon ("spiritual fracture," "collective memory").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The echo cartographer profession offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic exploration, and the concept of walls holding memory provides originality. The synthesis of climate catastrophe with architectural memory feels specific. However, the climate disaster frame and discovered-diary structure echo familiar templates without sufficient transformation.</comment>
