<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to prove the ghost legend and uncover truth drives consistent action throughout, with embodied tension ("Heart hammering," "damp pages clinging to his chest like a second heartbeat"). The transformation from seeking musical codes to discovering an innocence map shows earned progression. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("liminal world suspended between ruin and revelation") that doesn't fully embody the emotional state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as water damage progressively reveals meaning, culminating in Elias accepting "the ghost's message now his burden and his gift" - a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost. The pattern of water-formed revelations builds causally from program to architectural sketch to final resolution note. Orientation anchors (Elias, flooded opera house, searching for ghost's code) establish clearly within opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The flooded opera house functions as both setting and discovery mechanism - water creates the revelatory images that drive the plot. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("floodwater swirled around his ankles," "liquid mercury"). The waterlogged program's physical transformation ("gilded edges peeling like ancient skin") directly enables the story's central discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity about legend to deciphering ephemeral water-damage code to uncovering proof of innocence. The ticking pressure of the program "disintegrating entirely" forces immediate action. Cost is visible in Elias's acceptance of carrying this burden forward, though the final transformation could show more visceral price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the water-damage imagery without explicit statement - dissolution revealing truth, ruin as medium for communication. The final image of "a single, clear note... Not a requiem, but a resolution" resonantly answers the question of why Voss lingers. The "in between spaces" concept meaningfully shapes how discovery occurs through the liminal flood state.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, particularly strong in descriptive passages ("lit only by the erratic dance of his kerosene lantern"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("drowned cathedral of sound") slightly dulls immediacy. POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature focused on musical and water-formed imagery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high with most lines advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("liminal world suspended between ruin and revelation") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete. No significant loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of water damage creating coded messages is genuinely fresh, transforming the flood from obstacle to revelation mechanism. The synthesis of ghost story, historical injustice, and physical decay into a coherent discovery narrative shows strong originality. The specific detail of tilting the booklet to guide water toward resolution demonstrates inventive concrete thinking.</comment>
