I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and symbolic actions toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than strict causal turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from crafting death memorials to cultivating life is earned through concrete actions—scattering origami with coordinates, embedding seeds in glass orbs, illuminating the curtains. Her internal contradiction between grief and the fragile "subdued ardor" plays out through embodied choices, though some emotional transitions could be more granular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres well, building from dust-filled locket through discovered stencil to the illumination climax where projected light validates overlooked life. The closure—receiving the origami lotus with wildflower petal—completes a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (her years of grief work transformed). The lens holds consistently throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory functions as more than backdrop—its brass telescopes, velvet curtains, and precision tools all enable Elara's transformation. The stencil's coordinates matching the observatory's alignment mechanisms creates a concrete constraint that shapes her final choice to illuminate outward rather than skyward. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through the dome sequences.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from personal grief to community healing as Elara's actions escalate from private mourning jewelry to public light projections. The rain-lashed Tuesday doubt creates genuine pressure before the illumination choice. Cost is visible in her tears and the years of grief work she's abandoning for this new path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of teaching "withering to bloom" emerges through concrete actions rather than statement—from death-memorializing jewelry to seed-embedded orbs to illuminating hidden resilience. The returned origami with wildflower petal resonantly answers the central question without moralizing, though the "curtains of intention" concept edges toward the abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent elevation with phrases like "calloused finger," "genuinely artificial perfection," and "fragile as moth wings." Some register drift occurs ("顽强 life" appears unexplained, likely an artifact). The POV remains stable in close third, though occasional phrases like "now felt like a mockery" could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose generally flows well with varied syntax, but several issues accumulate: the unexplained Chinese character "顽强," some abstract phrasing ("cosmic indifference," "wellspring of hope"), and occasional overwriting in the figurative language ("spark, fragile as moth wings"). The sentence beginning "Below, the city lights..." needs grammatical cleanup. Information density is strong in action sequences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The transformation of mourning jewelry into life-cultivation tools offers a fresh angle on grief narratives. The observatory-as-community-illuminator concept surprises, though the "curtains of intention" feels slightly forced. The specific detail of embedding dormant seeds in glass orbs and using astronomical precision tools for earthbound purposes shows genuine ingenuity.</comment>
