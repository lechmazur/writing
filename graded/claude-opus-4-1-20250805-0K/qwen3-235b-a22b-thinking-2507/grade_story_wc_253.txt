I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered details (whittling, narration, dried bouquet) and cadence shifts toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara's "remade hush" crystallizes as a survival strategy with visible cost.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is grounded in specific loss (daughter's death, dried bouquet as anchor) with embodied grief management through theatrical narration of mundane tasks. The internal contradiction between mandated happiness and authentic grief drives consistent micro-choices. Minor deduction for Mrs. Gable reading slightly stock as the compliance enforcer.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's "remade hush" - transforming enforced silence into chosen sanctuary where "grief breathed, light and unburdened." Cost is visible: accepting moral ambiguity, risking re-education, isolation. Orientation anchors clearly (farmhouse, post-Mandate world). Slight deduction as the transformation could be more decisively dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Wind turbines as "skeletal giants" effectively frame oppression while the dried bouquet and whittled bird constrain Elara's emotional expression. Setting details filter through POV bias ("mandated silence," "emotional void"). The potato peeling scene grounds abstract resistance in tactile action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving grief space under surveillance) escalates through Mrs. Gable's confrontation, forcing Elara to choose between safety and truth. The "darkness/potato" metaphor risks report but maintains her sanctuary. Cost is legible but the single confrontation limits pressure accumulation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: whittling as "carving away unnecessary wood" mirrors the Mandate's hollowing effect. The final image of grief breathing "light and unburdened" offers non-literal answer to surviving totalitarian emotional control. Slight deduction for "metaphor for the Mandate itself" being too explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive theatrical narration voice ("Behold, the humble blade") creates ironic distance from mandated emotion. POV maintains consistent blank affect with submerged interiority. Mrs. Gable's dialogue carries appropriate tension but could differentiate more from Elara's register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves purposeful rhythm variation and strong sensory detail ("shavings curling like pale smoke"). Some repetitive structures ("She began," "She felt," "She spoke") create minor drag. The "light and unburdened" ending lands effectively but "remade hush" appears three times without sufficient evolution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian emotional control with grief-as-performance-art resistance. The theatrical narration of mundane tasks as camouflage shows genuine ingenuity. Specific detail (maple whittling, potato peeling as metaphor) elevates beyond template dystopia.</comment>
