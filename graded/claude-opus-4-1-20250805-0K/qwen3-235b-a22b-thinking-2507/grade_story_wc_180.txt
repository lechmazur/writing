<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve generational wisdom drives consistent choices, especially in using the ribbon as both practical solution and emotional bridge. The internal conflict between rigid permanence and necessary evolution creates genuine tension. However, Liora's convenient arrival and immediate understanding feels slightly unearned despite the emotional resonance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's realization that "vows like leaves must fall to nourish new growth," with the ribbon serving as the physical bridge between generations. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details build toward the mother-daughter reconciliation. Cost is visible in years of separation and the risk of using precious keepsake for repair.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard hybrid setting directly constrains Elara's work—she needs cobalt glass but has none, forcing the ribbon solution. Sensory details like "apple and pear branches weaving through shattered stained glass" create vivid specificity. The setting embodies the central tension between preservation and natural change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom before it's lost—faces escalating pressure through material shortage forcing the ribbon choice. The conflict deepens from external (contract breach, missing supplies) to internal (rigid thinking about permanence). However, Liora's arrival resolves tension too conveniently without sufficient prior causality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The deciduous vows metaphor elegantly unifies theme: wisdom must shed and renew rather than remain rigid. The ribbon transforms from keepsake to functional bridge to symbol of continuity. The ending achieves resonance without stating the moral, letting the planted sapling embody renewal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent POV with character-specific perception ("her one clear quartz eye scanning"). Dialogue feels natural with subtext ("Mom... I understand now"). Some filter phrases like "Elara knew better" slightly distance immediacy but serve characterization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variation and strong verbs ("breached," "snaking," "snatched"). Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor repetition in emotional labeling ("tears pricked," "voice trembling") and some abstract phrasing ("accidental wisdom sparked") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard fusion offers fresh specificity, avoiding generic abandoned church tropes. The quartz eye detail adds memorable texture. However, the mother-daughter reconciliation through shared craft follows familiar patterns without significant transformation of the archetype.</comment>
