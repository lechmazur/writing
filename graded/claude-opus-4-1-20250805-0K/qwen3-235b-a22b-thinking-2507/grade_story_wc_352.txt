<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prism-minded archivist demonstrates clear motivation and consistent traits, with concrete interiority ("Her prism mind refracted the problem into facets"). The character makes meaningful choices under pressure, particularly the decision to copy the combinations despite time constraints. However, the transformation lacks deeper internal contradiction—she achieves her goal relatively smoothly without significant cost to her beliefs or identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear causal structure with gravity inversion as the central mechanism driving plot. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the archivist transforms from keeper to "harbinger of the blaze" with implied future cost ("weight of her task"). Orientation anchors solidly by line 3. The causality holds but the cost remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto and gravity inversion create genuine spatial constraints that shape tactics ("kicked off from the wall, propelling herself"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("mist clinging...like a second skin"). The inverted chamber revelation where inscriptions appear on the former ceiling demonstrates environment directly enabling discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (retrieving forgotten combinations before gravity restores) creates time pressure that tightens once. Agency manifests through the archivist's decision to risk entry and her swift copying under deadline. However, the conflict lacks a meaningful reversal or complication—she succeeds without significant opposition beyond the time limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the seeds/blaze metaphor system and the concept of vigilance as a living network. The ending offers resonance without stating a moral ("a quiet revolution begun in a serpent's grotto"). However, the thematic exploration remains somewhat surface-level, lacking the complexity that would arise from genuine counter-arguments or moral ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. The perceptual signature shows through selective attention ("Her prism mind refracted the problem into facets"). Voice maintains consistency through pressure moments. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't fully match the established tone ("harbinger of the blaze").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is adequate with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some metaphor mixing occurs ("seeds of vigilance" that can "blaze") and occasional template phrasing appears ("She understood now," "This was the moment"). The "latent blaze" repetition feels somewhat forced rather than organic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The gravity inversion mechanic offers a fresh angle on the hidden knowledge trope. The specific detail of inscriptions appearing on the inverted ceiling shows originality. However, the overall arc (archivist retrieves hidden knowledge to restore an order) follows familiar fantasy patterns without significant transformation. The execution is competent but not particularly memorable.</comment>
