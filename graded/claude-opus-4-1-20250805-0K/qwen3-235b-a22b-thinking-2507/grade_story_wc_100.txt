I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and embodied through physical detail (calloused fingers, slumped shoulders), with internal contradiction between his exhaustion and stubborn persistence driving the descent. The final choice to maintain eternal vigil shows genuine cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("restless echoes trapped beneath the waves") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Silas transforms from burying the dead to maintaining perpetual light for the restless. The cost is explicit: "his own rest forever deferred." Who/where/when anchored early. Slight deduction for density that occasionally obscures immediate causality in the middle section.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Underwater library setting constrains choices effectively—the diving bell's "fragile bubble of breath" and water pressure create tangible danger. Strong sensory work with "ink-blurred manuscripts floating like spectral jellyfish." The broken lens's transformation into prism using bioluminescence shows environment shaping solution. Some passages lean abstract rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal exhaustion to cosmic responsibility for the restless dead. The transformation of the lens from distress signal to calming beacon represents meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible: Silas sacrifices his own rest to provide it for others. Minor issue with the spectral inhabitants feeling somewhat abstract until resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between Silas's undertaker work and the underwater dead—both seeking "rest a permanent address." The broken lens becoming whole through its fracture offers resonant paradox. Final image of "permanent vigil against the dark" reweights the opening without stating a moral. Slightly abstract in places but avoids explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with consistent undertaker's perspective coloring perception ("lowering coffins into indifferent earth"). Strong rhythmic control in long, accumulative sentences that mirror the water's pressure. Some register drift into elevated diction ("spectral jellyfish," "abyssal gloom") that strains against Silas's working-class profession, though the lyric mode partially justifies this.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dense, purposeful prose with strong information density—most sentences advance multiple layers. Good syntactic variety and rhythm modulation. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("silent scream from the deep that resonated in his marrow") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete. The prose serves the accumulative mode but occasionally tips into purple territory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker-as-lighthouse-keeper for the drowned dead, with the broken lens becoming stronger through its fracture. The underwater library as repository of lost souls rather than just knowledge adds originality. Specific details like "bioluminescence of deep-sea plankton" ground the fantastical. Some familiar ghost-story elements prevent higher scoring.</comment>
