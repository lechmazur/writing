<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is grounded in his diagnosis and oath to protect the symbiosis, driving consistent choices through copper wire intervention. His "brazen calm" manifests convincingly through methodical work despite mortality, though internal contradiction could be sharper. The final moment of peace as the sparrow lands shows earned acceptance with visible cost (raw hands, tight lungs).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through diary entries and wire-wrapping that builds toward Resonant Reconfiguration—the completed orchard as visible interspecies diplomacy. The closure lands with felt cost ("hands were raw, his lungs tight") and conceptual weight as the pact becomes legible. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The living stone pillars that breathe and soften where wire touches bark create a distinctive setting that constrains Aris's methods—he must work gently to preserve both species. Sensory detail is selective (copper gleaming against wet bark, stone's cool surface) and the orchard functions as active participant. The environment directly shapes tactics through the pillars' delicate lattice requiring precise wire placement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (six months to live) through systematic intervention (wire-wrapping) to the revelation that "They listen"—confirming the symbiosis is reciprocal. The dominant stake of preserving interspecies respect before death tightens as villagers scoff, forcing Aris to make his work undeniable. Cost is visible in physical toll and the foreclosed option of easier final months.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the copper wire becomes a physical manifestation of "tender redirection" and mutual care between species. The final image of the sparrow on warm copper resonates as proof the lesson lives beyond Aris. "Not me, but the pact" crystallizes the theme without moralizing, letting the transformed orchard speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent botanical precision ("delicate lattice," "copper trajectories") fitting an island caretaker's expertise. The perceptual signature shows in how Aris reads the pillars' groans as communication and tracks stress points. Some filter verb clustering ("felt no anger," "felt sufficient") slightly dulls immediacy in emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Copper wire, thin and pliable, coiled in his palm like a promise"). Rhythm varies effectively between longer observations and short declarations ("They listen"). Minor repetition of "brazen calm" and some filter verbs ("felt," "felt") create slight drag but don't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of living stone pillars that breathe and respond to touch offers fresh specificity beyond typical nature mysticism. The copper wire method as "tender redirection" rather than binding transforms the expected caretaker role. The synthesis of architectural preservation through biological understanding feels earned, though the dying caretaker frame is familiar.</comment>
