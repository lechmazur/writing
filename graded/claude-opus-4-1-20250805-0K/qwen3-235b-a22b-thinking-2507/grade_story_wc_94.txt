<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to understand "the cartography of scars" drives concrete actions—timing lightning strikes, interpreting Elara's message, finding constellations in his wounds. His transformation from silenced poet to observatory keeper who reclaims voice ("We are the constellations we survive") shows earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("grief thinned to transparency") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pattern and density through the storm-timing ritual that mirrors the gaps between scars, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Silas transforms from waiting for external conjunctions to witnessing one within himself. Cost is visible in the five years of silence broken, the scars that map his journey, and Elara's absence. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "cartography" metaphor's resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting actively constrains choice—the storm prevents astronomical observation, forcing Silas into his timing ritual. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (lightning painting skin, rain lashing plexiglass, brass timer cool against palm). The darkroom timer as micro-setting object constrains his actions throughout. Deduction for some generic storm imagery and the abstract "cloud sea" that doesn't fully ground spatial reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the cartography of scars—evolves from external observation to internal revelation through the storm-timing ritual. Escalation occurs through accumulation: each timed interval reveals deeper meaning until the final realization that "scars were not wounds but waypoints." Cost is legible in the physical scars, lost career, and Elara's disappearance, though the resolution leans slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of timing lightning strikes to understand the "silence between strikes" where "truth lives in the pause." The final line "We are the constellations we survive" offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights all prior scar imagery. The story resists easy moralizing, embracing the complexity of survival and transformation through violence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinct lyric register with controlled rhythm ("furiously tranquil precision," "storm-kissed wonder") that modulates with emotional intensity. The perceptual signature is consistent—a poet's attention to pattern and metaphor even in scientific observation. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("archaeology of pain") that slightly exceeds the established range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm that accelerates during the timing sequence. Information density is high—most lines advance both literal action and metaphorical meaning. Deductions for abstract phrases like "grief thinned to transparency" and "archaeology of pain" that approach purple prose, plus some repetition of "cartography" without sufficient variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of poet-turned-astronomer timing lightning strikes to map internal scars offers a fresh angle on trauma and healing. The specific detail of the darkroom timer repurposed for stellar transits shows originality. The transformation of astronomical observation into bodily cartography feels earned, though the extended metaphor occasionally strains credibility.</comment>
