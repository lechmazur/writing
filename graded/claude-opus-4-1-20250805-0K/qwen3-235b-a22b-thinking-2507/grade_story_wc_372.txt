<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve meaning against oblivion is clear and consistent, driving micro-choices like calibrating the frequency sampler with trembling fingers. The internal conflict between duty and the weight of potential failure ("Her predecessor had failed this way") creates genuine tension. However, the character lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—she's purely dutiful without competing desires that would elevate complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara successfully measuring and preserving the vow's frequencies, with the library transforming from "tomb" to a space holding "the quiet pulse of hope." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through technical details (741 hertz, 328 hertz) that reweight the preservation act. Cost is visible in the trembling hands and weight of responsibility, though the transformation could be more decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen library setting directly constrains action through "quartz hush" and perpetual chill, with breath forming plumes that embody the preservation stakes. Specific details like "ice-glass windows" and the "obsidian lectern" create atmosphere while the frequency sampler's "copper wires and humming crystals" grounds the fantastical in tactile reality. The setting actively pressures choices through the library's own fading ("before these frozen shelves became mere memory").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the last luminous vow before oblivion—is signaled early and tightens through the risk of fracturing the vow's meaning ("one misalignment, and the vow's meaning would fracture into noise"). Escalation occurs through deepening technical precision as Elara measures specific frequencies, though agency remains limited to careful execution rather than decisive choice. The cost manifests in the predecessor's failure haunting the present action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of measuring light frequencies as metaphor for preserving meaning, avoiding abstract statements. The final image of "the quiet pulse of hope, meticulously preserved" offers a resonant answer to whether meaning can survive oblivion. Subtext operates through the frequencies themselves—"grief" at 328 hertz balanced with "resolve" at 528 hertz—embodying emotional complexity without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to the fantastical setting ("swirling clouds," "crystallized knowledge"). Perceptual signature emerges through Elara's technical focus on frequencies and measurements, though this could be more distinctive. Some phrases feel overwrought ("conjuring meaning from the edge of oblivion" appears verbatim from the prompt), and the voice occasionally drifts into purple prose without sufficient grounding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences advancing atmosphere or action, though some figurative language feels forced ("dust motes hung suspended like frozen stars"). The story suffers from repetitive phrasing around "luminous vows" and "edge of oblivion" that creates loops. Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions, and the elevated diction occasionally obscures rather than clarifies the action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frequency sampler concept offers a fresh angle on preservation magic, transforming abstract vows into measurable harmonics. The specific frequencies (741 hertz for "promise," 328 for "grief") ground the fantastical in pseudo-scientific detail. However, the core premise of preserving dying magic through archival work feels somewhat familiar, and several phrases echo directly from the prompt without transformation.</comment>
