I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's pacifist stance against her violent heritage creates genuine internal conflict, particularly when she chooses to sheathe rather than draw the dagger. The micro-choice to use the sandbag scrap as protective mulch reveals her values hierarchy under pressure. However, the raiders' too-convenient retreat without further testing her resolve slightly undermines the earned cost of her choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Earned Stasis closure when Elara's refusal to draw steel successfully defends through nurturing, with visible cost in risking the farm. The causal lens holds as her father's "quiet" inscription motivates her choice. Deducting for the raiders' undermotivated retreat which weakens the closure's earned quality, though the final image of "quiet, persistent blaze of care" does resonate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass dome constrains choices effectively—its fragility forces non-violent defense, and the "tranquil blaze" of light through glass charges both opening and closing images. The sandbag scrap's dual function as relic and protective mulch demonstrates excellent object-as-setting integration. Minor deduction for some overwritten description ("skeletal remains...clawed at dust-choked sky").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (defending the farm without violence) is clear, and pressure escalates when raiders arrive with "weapons glinting dully." However, the resolution feels too easy—the raiders retreat after minimal resistance, deflating the built tension. The cost exists but lacks the weight needed for this climactic moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of nurturing versus violence emerges organically through concrete actions—tending roses, sheathing the dagger, spreading protective mulch. The "quiet" motif effectively bridges father's violence and daughter's peace. However, the ending veers toward explicit thematic statement ("testament not to conquest, but to the quiet, persistent blaze of care").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in noticing "minute shift in a leaf's angle" and "almost imperceptible tremor." Voice maintains consistency through elevated but controlled diction matching Elara's contemplative nature. Slight overwriting in places ("grim monument to the world that ended yesterday") but rhythm effectively modulates during the confrontation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("soft *snick* of steel on leather louder than any shout"). However, several overwritten phrases burden momentum: "skeletal remains...clawed," "fragile bubble of life," "swirling dust as silently as they'd come." The extended metaphorical language occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The pacifist-defender-through-nurturing angle offers freshness, and using agricultural protection as literal defense shows ingenuity. However, the setup (violent father's peaceful daughter in post-apocalyptic farm) follows familiar templates. The specific synthesis of elements prevents a lower score, but doesn't achieve breakthrough originality.</comment>
