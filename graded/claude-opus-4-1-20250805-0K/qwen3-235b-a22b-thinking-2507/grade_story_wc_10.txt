I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through sensory layers and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where silence transforms into visual music.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (tracing frost, adjusting equipment, sketching notes). Her internal contradiction between seeking sonic memory and embracing visual translation drives genuine tension. The final choice to translate warmth into music shows earned transformation with visible cost—three years of struggle crystallizing into acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from failure (chaotic thermal data) through discovery (quartz resonator) to reconfiguration (warmth as music). The closure—Elara translating silence into visual symphonies—lands with clear cost: abandoning sound's restoration for thermal composition. Who/where/when anchored early ("winterglass conservatory," "three years since").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory functions as active constraint—its frozen environment enables thermal imaging while preserving the orchids' steady signatures. Sensory details ("frost-laced panes," "ice-veined walls," "cool blue heat signature") are selective and purposeful. The glacial lilies' unwavering thermal glow becomes instrumental to resolution, making setting indispensable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal grief to artistic breakthrough as Elara's frustration with chaotic data transforms into discovery. The resonator's introduction creates meaningful deepening—not just solving but reframing the problem entirely. Cost is visible: three years of failed attempts before accepting silence's permanence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete discovery: adaptation requires embracing loss rather than fighting it. The final image—"warmth wrote symphonies"—offers resonant answer without stating moral. The conservatory's "unshaken marvels" become thematic anchor for resilience through transformation rather than restoration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with selective perception ("frost-laced," "crystalline air"). Some register elevation strains POV credibility ("rectifying emotional turbulence into pure, coherent frequencies"). The silent world constraint is handled well through mime and thermal observation, though technical passages occasionally drift toward exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows moments of beauty ("tears carving paths," "liquid moonlight") but suffers from repetitive structures and concept loops. "Unshaken marvels" appears four times without evolution; multiple sentences begin with "She'd" creating template cadence. The final third contains paraphrase loops ("silence wasn't empty; it was a canvas" restates prior material).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—translating emotional heat signatures into music in a silent world—offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of deafness, thermal imaging, and botanical constancy creates non-obvious angle. However, some metaphors feel forced ("frozen wings," "quiet fire") and the resolution's tidiness reduces risk.</comment>
