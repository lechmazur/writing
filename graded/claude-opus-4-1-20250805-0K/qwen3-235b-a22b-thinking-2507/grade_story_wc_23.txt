<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is crystal clear—navigating grief through purpose—and their patchwork body serves as embodied history of past salvage runs. The contradictory impulses (duty vs. grief, hope vs. despair) act simultaneously in scene, particularly when working through tears. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "geography of loss" metaphor that occasionally distances from embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure: Aris transforms grief into purpose by building the beacon, achieving Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (tears, burned hands, exhaustion). The phone calls create causal pressure that narrows options toward the final ignition. Slight deduction for the abstract "geography of loss" framing that doesn't fully pay off in concrete terms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The signal station setting directly constrains choices—the failed hydraulics create the crisis, the censer foot enables the solution. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (grinding bones, salt-thick voice, sandalwood smoke). The Black Reef and migration routes provide concrete spatial stakes. Loses points for not fully exploiting the station's physical constraints during the building sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate clearly: ships heading toward reef → mysterious calls → building device → moon waning/time pressure → final ignition with tears. The dominant stake (preventing shipwrecks while processing grief) tightens through the waning moon's deadline. Cost is legible in Aris's physical suffering and emotional release. Minor deduction for the calls arriving too conveniently without earned causality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief becomes navigable terrain through purposeful action, not erasure. The censer foot transforms from memorial object to functional beacon, embodying the theme perfectly. The final reframing of stars from "wounds" to "beacons" offers resonant closure without stating a moral. Slight deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("geography of loss") that risks theme-statement territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled diction and strong perceptual signature (Aris notices mechanical details, bronze patina, technical solutions). The mysterious caller's voice is effectively differentiated. Some register drift into elevated literary phrasing ("moonlight bled," "yawning chasm") that doesn't fully match Aris's technical mindset during crisis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("hands cobbled from mismatched skin grafts and polished brass"). Information density is good, most sentences do multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("starlight so sharp it felt like shards of glass") and abstract metaphors that slow momentum. Some template cadence in the middle section's building sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief narrative with lighthouse keeper crisis creates genuine originality. The patchwork navigator concept and the censer foot as moon-phase compass show inventive world-building. The reverse migration solution offers a non-obvious resolution. Loses some points for familiar grief-as-journey metaphor despite the specific execution.</comment>
