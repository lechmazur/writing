I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring an Accumulative/Textural drive lens based on the layered revelations and pattern-based progression toward understanding.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's grief-driven investigation feels authentic with concrete embodied details (fingers stained with ochre, tears on postcards). The shift from demanding answers to listening in quiet shows earned change. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("quietly driven") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara understands grief through darkness/light metaphor, with visible cost in her months of pain. The accumulative structure coheres through the postcards' hidden messages building toward revelation. Slight deduction for the cost being more told than dramatically enacted in the final moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong sensory work with amber pavilion, melting snow, cathedral light creating lived-in spaces. The etched glass window constrains how the secret messages can be revealed. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors ("living tapestries," "honey-colored wood") that could be more specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding Leo's mystery/processing grief) deepens through failed attempts with firelight and steam before the cathedral solution works. The pressure accumulates but lacks a sharp reversal or heightened cost at the climax—the revelation comes somewhat easily once she finds the right method.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the night-blooming flowers metaphor for grief needing darkness/quiet to reveal truth. The final insight about "gentle persistence of life" resonates without moralizing. Leo's hidden messages layer meaning effectively through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical touches ("winter's last snow surrendered to spring's hesitant breath"). Some register elevation in emotional peaks feels slightly forced ("umbral tenderness"). The POV maintains consistency with artist's perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and strong moments ("darkness holds the gentlest light"). Some overwriting appears in figurative density ("velvet glove," "scattered stars") and occasional template phrases ("breath caught"). The final paragraph contains slight redundancy about understanding that could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on grief through botanical mystery and hidden messages in lemon juice. The cathedral light revelation mechanism feels specific and earned. The synthesis of art, grief, and night-blooming flowers creates memorable particularity though the grief-processing arc itself follows familiar patterns.</comment>
