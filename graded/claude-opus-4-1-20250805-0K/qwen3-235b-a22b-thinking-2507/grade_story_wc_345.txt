<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation through desperation and fragile hope drives coherent action, with embodied details like "heart hammered" and breath fogging. The ghost's characterization as "strangely trustworthy" works through accumulated trust rather than assertion. Minor deduction for the ghost lacking complex motivation beyond pure altruism, and some emotional summary ("Hope felt like brambles") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change closure with water discovery transforming survival prospects, cost visible in "hours bled into morning" and collective exhaustion. Accumulative lens holds as ghost messages build trust through proven accuracy. Orientation anchored early (Kael, orchard, Veridia, pre-dawn). Deduction for slightly mechanical revelation sequence and cost that could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains through drought and failing systems, with floating rock arches creating atmosphere. The hidden aquifer beneath roots provides crucial plot mechanism. Strong sensory work ("scraped frost," "gnarled fruit trees"). Minor deduction for setting not fully constraining middle choices—the discovery feels convenient rather than fought for through environmental resistance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual doubt to collective mobilization, with water as clear survival necessity. The ghost's messages create accumulating pressure through proven reliability. Cost shows in physical labor and exhaustion. Deduction for resolution depending on convenient hidden resource rather than character-driven trade-offs, and pressure could tighten more decisively in the middle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of collective effort over individual struggle emerges through action, with the ghost orchestrating cooperation. The nebula image recurring at closure ("blazed directly overhead") effectively reweights as earned respite. Slight deduction for the thematic echo in "respite earned... by the collective effort" being too explicit, though it avoids full moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent third-limited POV with selective perception ("frost," "pre-dawn chill"). Some distinct texture in phrases like "Hope felt like brambles." Deduction for occasional register elevation ("fractured family bound only by shared desperation") that doesn't fully match Kael's farmer perspective, and some filter-verb clustering ("looked up," "touched").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum. Strong opening anchors and final image. Deductions for repetitive "ghost" usage (11 times), some abstract phrasing ("strangely trustworthy" repeated), and occasional overwriting ("colossal floating rock arches, remnants of the planet's unstable core"). Template cadence in "They hadn't... only the..." construction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story with sci-fi colony survival, avoiding typical haunting tropes. The altruistic ghost concept offers originality. Specific details like "butterfly garden watering bell" and chalk messages distinguish the piece. Deduction for somewhat predictable hidden water resolution and the ghost's pure altruism lacking complexity or cost.</comment>
