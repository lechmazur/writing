I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens**: Causal - the story follows a because/therefore chain where Elara discovers the shadow's origin (negative imprint), understands its nature (consequence of misplaced hope), and transforms it through specific action (injecting unrecorded memory).

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her method deliberate, with strong interiority around preserving hope's "fragile geometry." The transformation from fighting to accepting the shadow shows genuine internal conflict. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of "hope's shape" which could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from discovery to understanding to transformation, with clear closure as the shadow metamorphoses and Elara accepts the cost ("naive shared dream of effortless light was gone forever"). The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of the shadow concept requiring some interpretive work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blooming library setting is vivid and constrains choices - Elara must use the specific tools and archives available. The river stone grounds her physically against "airy disorientation." Environment directly shapes the solution through the dream archives and console system.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from subtle erasures to consuming entire sequences to the revelation that hope itself feeds the darkness. The tightening works well under causal lens. Minor deduction as the physical/temporal pressure could be more immediate - the work feels methodical rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox that shared hope creates collective despair. The final image of "harder-won, solitary ember" versus "effortless light" resonates without moralizing. The river stone's "unshareable core of solitary resilience" provides concrete thematic anchor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("sun bled into the cloud-sea," "ink-rooted knowledge"). POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature. Some register elevation in places ("metastasizing across time") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Deductions for density issues - multiple metaphors cluster in single sentences ("library's drifting edge," "spectral parchment," "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" in opener). Some abstract phrasing ("geometry of hope," "sentient void") reduces clarity in key beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-sharing technology with library-as-organism creates memorable world. The shadow as "consequence of shared hope misplaced" offers non-obvious insight. The solution through "unshareable core" transforms expected confrontation into acceptance.</comment>
