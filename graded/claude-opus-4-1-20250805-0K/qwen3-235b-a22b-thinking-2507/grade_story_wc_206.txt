I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation burns clear—reclaiming stolen light to preserve the city's harmonic balance. The covenant of rust creates genuine constraint, with physical oxidation as the price of falsehood. His final exhaustion and trembling hands show visible cost, though internal contradiction could deepen during the tethering sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: Silas successfully tethers the philosopher's stone chip to restore the city's light, with visible cost in his rusted hands and exhaustion. The covenant of rust persistently constrains his tactics throughout. Causal lens holds: the thief's presence → poisoned lilies → necessity of perfect truth → successful tethering.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The resonance chamber functions as active constraint—its harmonic requirements shape every action. Wilting starlight lilies embody the dishonesty poisoning the space, then regenerate as proof of restoration. The covenant's rust-colored scars and metallic taste create visceral specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through the tethering sequence: sweat beads, lilies crumble to ash, the covenant tightens with metallic taste flooding his mouth. The risk of shattering the chip creates genuine jeopardy. Cost is visible in his trembling, rusted hands at closure, though middle pressure could intensify.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the covenant's demand for absolute truth against pervasive lies—embodied in wilting flowers and oxidizing metal. The final image of fresh lilies pushing through ash resonates without stating a moral. "Mending what isn't torn" deepens from literal repair to harmonic restoration of the city's essence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent mythic-technical register with controlled vocabulary ("tinkersong wonder," "harmonic truth"). Perceptual signature shows in how Silas reads metal's secrets and feels resonance. Some filter-verb clustering ("He felt the rust covenant tighten") dulls immediacy during peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Dust motes danced in the single shaft of weak afternoon light piercing the high vault, illuminating wilting starlight lilies." Some abstract phrasing ("the lie thick in the air") and occasional overwriting ("oppressive shroud of midnight *ripped*") create minor friction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The covenant of rust—physical oxidation as the price of dishonesty—offers fresh constraint on the repair-magic premise. Combining harmonic resonance with alchemical elements creates non-obvious synthesis. The specific cost mechanism (rust appearing on hands and tools) transforms familiar truth-magic tropes.</comment>
