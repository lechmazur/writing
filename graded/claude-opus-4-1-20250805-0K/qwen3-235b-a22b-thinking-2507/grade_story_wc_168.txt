I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Inferred Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered reflection and imagery toward a resonant reconfiguration where Kai transforms grief into purpose.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kai's internal journey from guilt to resolve is well-motivated through concrete details (the porcelain box, Elara's lost trust). The contradiction between his firefighter competence and parental failure creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract enlightenment sequence that briefly loses embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with clear cost - Kai accepting his failure to transform it into community vigilance. The accumulative structure coheres through the porcelain box motif and moonlight imagery. Deduction for the slightly abstract middle section where "enlightenment" arrives without sufficient dramatization of the shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge and charred valley create atmospheric pressure that mirrors internal state. Sensory details like "liquid silver" moonlight and the box's "jagged seam familiar against his thigh" are selective and purposeful. The setting constrains choice when Kai sits on the boulder to confront his guilt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (transforming personal guilt into communal warning) deepens through reflection rather than external conflict. Cost is visible in Elara's lost innocence and Kai's ongoing "ember in his chest." The internal pressure tightens as he moves from isolation to shared purpose, though the transformation could use more concrete resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the cracked porcelain box as vessel for "hard-won wisdom" and the fire's dual nature as destroyer and teacher. The final image of Kai descending toward town lights resonates without stating a moral. Strong integration of personal loss with universal vigilance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("slow dance of celestial bodies"). POV remains stable with appropriate interiority for Kai's reflective state. Some elevated diction ("visceral truth of a father's broken promise") occasionally strains against the character's voice but serves the meditative tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery, but several instances of abstract telling weaken momentum: "different understanding emerged," "Enlightenment didn't arrive as a shout." The phrase "Hard softness filled him" feels forced. Some redundancy in the middle section about transforming pain into universal language.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The specific detail of a firefighter's broken promise to his daughter offers a fresh angle on loss and responsibility. The transformation from personal penance to community guide feels earned. However, the enlightenment sequence relies on familiar spiritual awakening patterns without sufficient transformation.</comment>
