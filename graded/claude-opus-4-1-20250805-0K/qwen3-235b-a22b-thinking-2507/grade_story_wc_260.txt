I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered discoveries and reflections toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara finds balance through patient, reconstructive work.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority through specific details like "hollow ache in her chest" and the chameleon's "jewel-bright eyes reflecting the lantern light like fractured emeralds." The internal conflict between self-respect and compassion plays out through concrete micro-choices. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("fragile convictions") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara transforms from trusting dealer to patient healer, with visible cost in the "broken pieces of the night." The accumulative structure builds through layers of discovery and shedding. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (workshop purpose unclear initially).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail ("scent of damp cedar and starlight") and the workshop setting constrains choices effectively. The chameleon's damaged tail tip serves as crucial physical evidence. The misty night atmosphere supports the contemplative tone throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from discovering fraud to witnessing physical trauma to choosing patient reconstruction over immediate action. The chameleon's gradual trust-building provides meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in time spent and emotional toll of shattered convictions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between Elara shedding her misplaced trust and the chameleon shedding damaged skin. The white tail tip becomes a powerful symbol of hidden trauma. Final image of the chameleon basking achieves resonance without stating moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with selective perception ("the quiet hum of the night insects amplifying the hollow ache"). Some elevated diction ("translucent skin," "fractured emeralds") fits the contemplative mood. Minor register drift in places ("ethically sourced specimens").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure. Several instances of abstract phrasing ("fragile convictions," "profound, quiet stillness") and some filter constructions ("She remembered," "She observed"). The metaphor "shedding layers" works but becomes slightly repetitive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh angle on wildlife trafficking through intimate focus on single animal and handler's moral reckoning. The layered "shedding" structure offers originality. Some familiar elements (discovery of fraud, slow trust-building) executed competently rather than transformed.</comment>
