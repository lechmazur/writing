I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and embodied through specific actions—his ability to identify gaits drives key tactical choices (mimicking the electrician's walk, the injured crane operator's shuffle). The internal consistency holds as he uses whisper-precision against shouts, though the final revelation lacks emotional complexity beyond validation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkages (map discovery → challenge accepted → navigation → completion). Closure lands as Decisive Change with "proof is done," though the cost feels more theoretical than visceral—we see tactical difficulty but minimal personal price for Silas's success.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting actively constrains choices throughout—metal walls swallow shouts, the geomagnetic storm disrupts navigation, container acoustics enable Silas's whisper tactics. The "unnatural green haze," "rust-streaked shipping containers," and specific locations (Junction Seven, Container Gamma-12) create a lived-in industrial maze that shapes every tactical decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from discovery to infiltration with clear pressure points: the dawn deadline, Rourke's presence requiring improvisation, the quarantine zone's forbidden status. The dominant stake (proving whispers beat shouts) drives tactics consistently, though the threatened crane sabotage feels abstract rather than personally costly to Silas.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The whispers-versus-shouts theme emerges organically through action—Silas's soft pebble tick defeating Rourke's barking, the storm making radios useless while his quiet methods succeed. The final line "quiet truths traveled farthest" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the entire navigation sequence as philosophical proof.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with Silas's gait-reading ability coloring observations ("light and hesitant," "heavy boots of dockworkers"). Prose modulates effectively under pressure, though some phrases edge toward overwriting ("colossal tuning forks," "knife cuts").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong momentum, but figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("metal skins vibrating like colossal tuning forks," "creases sharp as knife cuts," "cold, heavy zodiac coin"). The "calculated spontaneity" phrase feels forced rather than organic to voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The gait-identification attribute offers fresh specificity, particularly when Silas mimics different walks to evade detection. The whisper-based infiltration method and bioluminescent map activated by geomagnetic surge show inventive world-building, though the Whisperer's puzzle-challenge frame feels somewhat conventional.</comment>
