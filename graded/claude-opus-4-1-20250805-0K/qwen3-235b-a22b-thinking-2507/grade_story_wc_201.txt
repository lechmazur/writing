<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's proprioceptively enhanced perception creates genuine internal contradiction as he navigates pain through mathematical precision while clinging to abstract hope. The micro-choices of shifting stance to modulate UV pain reveal character through embodied action. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("desperate hope," "brutal mathematics") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and trauma responses build toward Kael learning to navigate the forest's "brutal logic" with "deliberate, aching grace"—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost. The pattern of UV pain modulation through proprioceptive mapping creates coherent escalation. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (forest location unclear until mid-story) and some causality opacity around how the forest relates to the interrogation chamber.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The UV forest functions as both setting and antagonist, its fractal light patterns constraining every movement and forcing Kael to use proprioceptive mapping to survive. The pewter strap bridges interrogation room and forest effectively. Strong sensory hierarchy filtered through enhanced proprioception makes the environment visceral and specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative pressure as Kael progresses from passive suffering to active navigation of the UV field, discovering pain modulation through movement. The cost is legible in "agonizing, precise movement." However, the stakes could be clearer—survival is implied but not explicitly threatened, weakening urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "mathematics of mercy" theme emerges organically through Kael's attempt to find patterns in suffering, with the forest's fractal structure offering a non-literal answer. The interrogator's quote about "measured suffering" effectively bridges sections. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract final insight about "navigating structure" rather than more concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature through proprioceptively enhanced consciousness creates a unique lens for experiencing the world. The voice maintains consistency even under extreme stress, with syntax appropriately fragmenting during trauma responses. Clean free indirect style throughout with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid sensory detail and varied syntax. Deductions for repetitive phrasing ("ultraviolet" appears 8 times, "proprioception/proprioceptively" 6 times) and some abstract constructions ("desperate hope," "brutal mathematics," "fragile equilibrium"). The filter verb "remembered" appears multiple times but serves the trauma-response method.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The proprioceptive enhancement as a torture side-effect that becomes survival tool offers fresh specificity. The mathematical approach to mercy through physical navigation rather than moral calculation provides originality. Some familiar dystopian interrogation elements prevent higher scoring.</comment>
