I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows a because/therefore logic where Elara's mathematical approach to her father's asylum case leads to a negotiated solution.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent - using honest calculation to save her dishonest father. The internal contradiction between inherited brilliance and moral integrity creates genuine tension. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat mechanical, and Agent Reynolds' transformation lacks sufficient psychological grounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The closure technically lands (Reynolds agrees to present the proposal) but the cost remains abstract - we don't see what Elara sacrifices or what specific price is paid. The causal chain holds but the transformation from "rigid official" to "convinced by equations" strains credibility. The orientation is clear early, preventing further penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The funeral home setting provides atmospheric contrast and the ink pot functions as more than ornament, allegedly enabling Elara's mathematical clarity. However, the setting doesn't sufficiently constrain choices - the negotiation could occur anywhere. Sensory detail is selective but doesn't fully exploit the macabre potential of the prep room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (father's deportation) is clear from the start, but escalation is minimal - Elara prepares, Reynolds arrives, she presents, he accepts. The conflict lacks meaningful resistance or complication. The "fair trade" resolution arrives too easily without sufficient opposition or cost demonstration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme of finding mathematical fairness in moral ambiguity has potential but resolves too neatly. The story tells us about "equilibrium in every exchange" but doesn't dramatize the complexity. The ending's suggestion that fraud can be offset by future service feels morally convenient rather than earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency with academic precision appropriate to Elara's mathematical mindset. POV remains stable throughout. However, the dialogue between Elara and Reynolds feels stilted, and Reynolds' voice lacks distinction from the narration's register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose suffers from overwriting - "deathly vitality," "hushed intimacy," "electric pulse syncing with clock's tick" accumulate without advancing the story. Multiple instances of abstract telling ("equilibrium existed in every exchange," "tangible fairness") replace concrete dramatization. The line "the ink's viscosity defying gravity" exemplifies unnecessary purple prose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept of using mathematical models to negotiate asylum shows creativity, and the juxtaposition of embalming room and immigration law is unexpected. However, the magical ink pot feels grafted on rather than integral, and the resolution relies on a familiar "ends justify means" template without fresh insight.</comment>
