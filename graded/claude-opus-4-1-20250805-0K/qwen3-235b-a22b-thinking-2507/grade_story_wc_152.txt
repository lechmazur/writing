<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's disguise as a "harmless, scatterbrained embroiderer" creates consistent internal contradiction between performed foolishness and sharp tactical thinking, with embodied tension in deliberate fumbling while tracking guards. The final choice to risk transmission shows clear cost (exposure/death), though the emotional aftermath could deepen beyond relief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Situational lens drives coherent pressure toward Charged Poise closure where Elara completes transmission with visible risk/cost. The seven-minute window creates clear causality, though the reply signal arrives too conveniently without complication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory's brass instruments, dome mechanism, and ventilation slit directly constrain Elara's transmission method and timing. The eternal candle serves dual function as workspace tool and signal source, making environment essential to tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the seven-minute countdown with guard proximity creating immediate danger, forcing Elara to maintain her disguise while executing precise timing. The transmission succeeds but lacks a visible price beyond risk—no actual loss or sacrifice occurs on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of "unheard stories" emerges through hidden phosphorescent messages, coded transmissions, and Elara's invisible resistance work. The final stitched candle flame symbolizes hope for the unseen without stating its meaning explicitly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent free indirect style with selective perception ("weak autumn sun," "cobalt observatory") and controlled rhythm that accelerates during the transmission sequence. Some filter phrases ("she forced herself") could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose shows strong sensory detail and varied syntax, though some phrases edge toward overwriting ("labyrinth of adjacent possibilities"). Minor redundancy in describing Elara's foolish act multiple times without variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The disguised-spy-as-embroiderer premise transforms through specific details like phosphorescent ink and the observatory setting. The use of embroidery to encode rebellion messages offers fresh specificity.</comment>
