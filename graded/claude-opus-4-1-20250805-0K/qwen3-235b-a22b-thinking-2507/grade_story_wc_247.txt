<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with Elara's physical relationship to silence and the empty camera as extension of self. The final choice to continue despite isolation shows earned endurance with visible cost. Minor deduction for Kael's somewhat convenient appearance/disappearance pattern, though his presence creates necessary pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks that reweight silence from absence to language. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elara accepts isolation as the price for preserving silence's song—"for now, that was enough" crystallizes cost. The transformation from mapping to music provides decisive deepening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Luminous harbor setting constrains choices—moonlight pools determine mapping locations, phosphorescent waves create visual rhythm. The pier's chalked scores become physical setting that alters how others move through space. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's professional priorities: visual frames, durational measurements, acoustic voids.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from private practice to public disruption to musical translation, each narrowing Elara's options between invisibility and impact. The flute transformation deepens pressure—her mapped silences now demand performance. Cost is legible in the trade-off: beauty exists "only because she was unseen."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: silence as language, invisibility as price for art, memory as resistance. The final image of "joyful sorrow" reweights all prior mapping as both triumph and loss. No explicit moralizing; the paradox that forgotten people preserve forgotten arts resonates without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's synesthetic translation of silence into imagined music. Controlled psychic distance maintains intimacy without head-hopping. Kael's sign language creates effective dialogue-equivalent with subtext. Some elevated diction ("phosphorescent," "cadence") fits the lyrical mode but occasionally drifts from character register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation matching scene pressure. Information density high—most sentences advance both external action and internal state. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("liquid pearl," "crystalline tone") and slight template cadence in the middle mapping sequence ("She positioned...Raising...she began").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-as-music with the photographer who captures absence rather than presence. The empty camera as frame for the unspoken transforms expected function. Risk-taking in the sign language dialogue and mapped duration notation system adds specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
