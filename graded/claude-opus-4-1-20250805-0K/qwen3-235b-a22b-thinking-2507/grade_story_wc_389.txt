<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation intensifies credibly from preservation to active sabotage, with contradictory impulses (faith in Prophet vs. emerging doubt) acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to weaponize the Portico's shadows earns its cost through prior setup of her mission and the Prophet's threat. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("gritty determination hardened her whimsy") rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the radio fragments reveal the Prophet's true nature (reversal), causing Elara to activate the Portico's defensive harmonics (decisive change with visible cost). The closure lands with the storm lessening and "Dawn is woven" - a resonant reconfiguration showing the world saved through shadow rather than light. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico constrains the climactic choice - its "eighth shadow" reflection becomes the key to atmospheric stabilization, and its crystalline lattice enables the defensive resonance. Setting details (ancient instrument array, dying radio dish, storm below/clarity above) create lived-in specificity that shapes available tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from passive monitoring to active intervention as radio fragments reveal the Prophet will destroy the Portico, threatening atmospheric collapse. The tightening occurs when Elara must choose between her former faith and using forbidden "ancient shadows." Cost is visible: risking detection by the sky-cutter to save the world.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the light/shadow dichotomy: the Prophet's "pure solar energy" versus Elara's "balanced shadow" creates complexity beyond simple binaries. The final image of dawn "in hues of rose and ash" offers a non-literal answer about synthesis. Slight deduction for the overtly thematic "Dawn is woven" line, though it works within the prophetic radio voice pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's astronomical lens ("crown of broken teeth," "star-shadows") and selective attention to radio frequencies. Prose modulates with pressure - fragmentary during radio reception, accelerating during the sabotage sequence. Some filter verb clusters ("she'd monitored," "believing") and occasional register elevation ("gritty determination") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied syntax and strong specific verbs ("traced," "hammered," "coalesced"). Information density high in radio fragments that advance plot while building atmosphere. Deductions for scattered template constructions ("fingers flying over," "heart hammered against ribs"), some filter verb accumulation, and the abstract "gritty determination hardened her whimsy" that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomical preservation with atmospheric harmonics - the Portico as both observatory window and planetary stabilizer. The Prophet as false dawn-bringer who misunderstands ancient technology offers a non-obvious angle on the savior-turned-destroyer trope. The specific integration of radio prophecy with technical sabotage feels earned rather than assembled.</comment>
