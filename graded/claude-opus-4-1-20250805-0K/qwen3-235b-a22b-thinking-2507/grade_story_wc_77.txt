<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clara's internal conflict between fear of still being dead and the need to confront that fear drives meaningful choices, with embodied terror ("heart hammered against ribs still tender"). The final renunciation of fear through acknowledgment carries visible cost. However, the whispering advisor lacks agency beyond prompting, and some emotional beats rely on abstract labels ("cold dread") rather than embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Clara's photograph reveals fear's weakness (being seen), with clear cost in confronting potential death. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and paradoxes build toward the final revelation. Orientation anchors (funhouse, post-resuscitation) establish early. Minor deduction for the advisor's convenience in providing exact solutions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The funhouse setting actively constrains choices through its "repulsive allure" and phosphorescent decay, with the opera clasp serving as both light source and key to resolution. Sensory details like "sticky with decades of grime" and "sickly, iridescent slime" create visceral atmosphere. The environment's transformation when fear manifests ("walls warping as if breathing") directly shapes the climactic confrontation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (escaping fear's trap through understanding its weakness) escalates from passive awakening to active confrontation, with Clara's agency driving the resolution through photographing herself. Cost is visible in embracing the curse and confronting death-fear. The paradox mechanism creates coherent pressure, though the advisor's guidance reduces some earned discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox that fear dies when acknowledged/seen, with the photograph literalizing this truth. The final line "no longer cursed, but finally seen" resonates without moralizing. Subtext operates through the luminance imagery and mirror reflections. Minor deduction for occasionally explicit thematic statements through the advisor's dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Voice maintains gothic-horror texture with controlled diction ("unbosomed," "repulsive allure") fitting the supernatural premise. POV remains stable with Clara's perceptual filter coloring descriptions. However, the advisor's dialogue occasionally drifts into overly articulate instruction ("Only paradox reveals truth here"), and some peak moments use filter verbs that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose creates atmosphere through specific imagery but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most high-pressure sentences ("like rotting jewels," "like maggots writhing in moonlight"). Some paraphrase loops occur ("Fear itself, drawn by her unbosomed confession" follows directly after she speaks her fear). Template cadence appears in the resolution sequence with repeated "She [verb]" constructions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of photography curse with confronting fear through paradox offers a fresh angle on horror escape narratives. The specific detail of fear being vulnerable to observation transforms the typical monster-confrontation template. However, the helpful advisor providing exact instructions reduces risk-taking, and some elements feel assembled rather than organic.</comment>
