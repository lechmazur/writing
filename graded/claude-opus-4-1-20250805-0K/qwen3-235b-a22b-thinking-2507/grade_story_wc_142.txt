I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring a **Causal drive lens** based on the clear because/therefore linkages throughout (graffiti discovery → understanding message → gathering community → proposing reorganization plan).

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's dual allegiance creates genuine internal conflict that drives his final choice to help the community reorganize. His "culture shock absorber" role perfectly positions him to mediate this crisis, though some interiority edges toward explanatory rather than embodied ("Hope warred with desperation" feels slightly abstract).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from graffiti discovery through community gathering to reorganization plan, with clear closure in the Resonant Reconfiguration of resistance through adaptation. The foundation stone chip effectively links past to present strategy. Cost is visible in the acceptance that privatization can't be stopped, only navigated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The raft city setting directly constrains choices through foundation deeds and physical vulnerability. Excellent integration of carnival atmosphere with economic threat, and the foundation stone chip grounds the abstract conflict in physical reality. The lighthouse buoy as meeting point uses setting purposefully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate clearly from observing graffiti to understanding imminent threat to proposing active resistance. The pressure tightens effectively when Elara reveals the contract, forcing Kael from observer to leader. Some cost could be more visceral—the acceptance of partial defeat lands intellectually but not quite emotionally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between paper ownership and spiritual belonging, culminating in "becoming the foundation they can't ignore." The network of graffiti messages transforming from warning to coordination tool provides concrete thematic resonance without preaching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with Kael's perspective coloring descriptions ("perpetual carnival's heartbeat thrumming"). Some phrases edge toward writerly rather than lived ("gentrification wasn't a sudden storm; it was a slow seep"), but voice remains largely controlled and distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some metaphors feel slightly overwrought ("Hope warred with desperation in his chest, a constant, uneasy hum"). Minor template cadence in middle section with repetitive "They would..." constructions. Information density is high and serves the story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The floating carnival city facing gentrification offers a fresh angle on familiar displacement themes. The graffiti-as-resistance-network and foundation stone as both physical and symbolic anchor show genuine ingenuity, though the resolution feels somewhat safe in its hope-through-community message.</comment>
