I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Hybrid (Causal dominant with Accumulative elements). The story follows a causal chain of discovery (diary → visions → debris arrangement → finding cipher key) while accumulating sensory and temporal layers through retrocognitive episodes.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through retrocognitive invasions that create genuine stakes. The contradiction between his scholarly solemnity and desperate urgency works well. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("the weight of unfinished justice pressing on his chest") and the convenience of his final understanding arriving so cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Decisive Change closure with Elias finding the cipher key and breaking the retrocognitive trap. The causal chain holds from diary discovery through debris arrangement to revelation. Cost is visible in his tears and the "burden he could carry forward." Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical resolution where understanding "flooded" him.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and Zeppelin Argus create vivid, specific atmosphere that constrains choices. Excellent sensory work with "bruised twilight sky," "black sand," and the contrast between the floating library's warmth and the dark lagoon below. The setting actively shapes Elias's actions and discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear escalation as retrocognitive visions intensify from fragments to full immersion, forcing Elias to act. The dominant stake (breaking free from temporal trap while uncovering truth) tightens effectively. Some convenience in how the debris arrangement immediately yields results, but cost is legible in the emotional and physical toll.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of confronting silenced history emerges through concrete action rather than statement. The debris arrangement as "parley with the past" and the final image of carrying forward the burden work well. Slight deduction for the somewhat neat resolution of historical trauma through individual discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevated diction matching the archivist protagonist. Strong perceptual signature in how Elias notices archival details and historical resonances. Some register elevation in phrases like "retrocognitively trapped sorrow" but it fits the character's scholarly nature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some overwriting appears ("the world tilting violently," "fragmented scenes flooded him"). Minor template cadence in the retrocognitive vision sequences. The filter verb "felt" appears multiple times. Information density is good but could be tighter in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of historical trauma recovery through supernatural temporal connection. The retrocognitive trap as both burden and tool is original. The specific detail of arranging beach debris as temporal communication elevates beyond standard ghost story or historical mystery templates.</comment>
