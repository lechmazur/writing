I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inferred: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through sensory accumulation and pattern intensification toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara finds Kaelen transformed but present.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through tactile searching and the "hollow ache of a bond severed." The internal contradiction between accepting cosmic cycles and refusing finality creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the fortune cookie's message feeling slightly convenient rather than fully earned through character-specific discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara finds Kaelen "not reborn, but remembered" with visible emotional cost ("wept"). The accumulative lens holds as spice-scents and moonlight density increase toward the final "homecoming." Deduction for the fortune cookie feeling mechanically inserted and some causality softness in how crushing spices summons essence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Evernight Orchard functions beautifully as both setting and pressure—"moon-apple trees" yield the spices that enable connection. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "liquid mercury" moonlight, "star anise, grains of paradise, saffron threads." The spices constrain choice and charge the final image of breathing them as "homecoming."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reconnecting with Kaelen) is clear, and pressure deepens through the spice-gathering ritual. However, escalation feels somewhat predetermined—no genuine obstacles complicate Elara's path once she interprets the fortune. The cost is felt but the journey lacks meaningful resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "reluctant metamorphosis"—both Kaelen's transformation and Elara's forced evolution "from companion to witness." The final realization that connection transcends physical form offers resonant, non-literal closure. Minor deduction for the fortune cookie's on-the-nose thematic guidance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm, though sometimes veers toward purple prose ("liquid mercury," "cosmic intimacy"). The perceptual signature of a beast whisperer sensing absence where life "should be" is distinctive. Deduction for occasional register elevation that strains credibility and some syntactic monotony in longer sentences.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting—nearly every sentence contains figurative language. Several instances of elevated diction clash with emotional immediacy: "paradoxically steady vibration," "sacred theft." The extended compound sentences create syntactic monotony. Information density remains strong and no paraphrase loops detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of beast-whispering with cosmic cycles and spice-ritual offers a non-obvious angle. The specific detail of moon-fruits containing ritual spices feels fresh. However, the phoenix-rebirth framework and fortune cookie device feel somewhat derivative, preventing higher scores despite strong execution.</comment>
