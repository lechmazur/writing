<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong characterization with Elara's isolation-yearning contradiction driving genuine internal conflict. The moment of panic transforming into focused action under pressure shows earned agency. Minor deduction for Chen's cryptic wisdom feeling slightly convenient, though his established pattern of "accidentally prophetic" messages partially earns this.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change with visible cost—the freighter saved through Elara's precise intervention using the microdot specs. Causal lens holds: storm triggers crisis, Chen's message provides solution method, Elara's technical execution saves ship. The "transpose life into a new key" motivation pays off in her transformation from passive keeper to "silent conductor." Minor deduction for the microdot's functionality feeling slightly convenient despite setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting functions as both pressure source (storm, Devil's Teeth) and solution mechanism (lighthouse beam manipulation). Strong sensory work: "salt-crusted walls," "sucking roar of water," "rain-lashed window." The lighthouse's forgotten wartime optical array provides crucial constraint. Deduction for some generic storm description that doesn't fully leverage the unique island isolation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly: isolation/yearning → mysterious microdot → freighter in mortal danger → successful intervention. The "sea singing backwards" as timing mechanism creates genuine pressure. Cost is visible in Elara's exhaustion and the near-disaster. Minor deduction because the resolution relies somewhat on convenient timing of storm and ship arrival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of "open secrets" effectively embodied through the microdot—knowledge visible but requiring context to understand. The transformation from keeper to conductor resonates. However, the thematic statement in the final paragraph ("the most profound secrets were always hiding in the open") edges toward explicit moralizing, triggering deduction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with distinctive perceptual signature—Elara notices technical details, light patterns, nautical dangers. Some elevated diction during crisis ("transpose this nightmare into hope") slightly strains the established voice. Dialogue minimal but Chen's cryptic speech is distinctive. Filter verb clusters in middle section ("she saw," "she knew") dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("rhythmic groan of the storm," "spidery script"). However, several instances of elevated register drift ("accidentally prophetic ramblings," "vast, mysterious symphony") and some repetitive phrasing around light/shadow. The final paragraph contains unnecessary philosophical abstraction that could be cut without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle on lighthouse keeper story through the microdot/espionage specs element creating an unexpected technical rescue. The "open secrets" concept offers originality. However, the wise old fortune cookie writer feels somewhat templated, and the storm-forces-crisis structure is familiar territory.</comment>
