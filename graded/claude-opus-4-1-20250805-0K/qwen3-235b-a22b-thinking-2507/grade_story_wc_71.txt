I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deepens through concrete discovery, with her need to understand houses' aliveness driving each test. The internal conflict between seeking and finding truth manifests through embodied reactions ("tears pricked," "heart quickened"). Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "creeping normality noticer" label that doesn't fully translate to embodied characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's understanding that "houses felt alive because they were sanctified by displaced objects of human care." The cost is visible in the Finnegan house's "fragile, returning warmth" and Elara's tears. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bay setting constrains choices through found objects (orris root, sea stones) and provides the testing ground for Elara's discovery. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("lavender dusk," "scent of baking bread"). The displaced objects function as micro-settings that directly enable the story's central revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity to urgent need as Elara tests three houses, with the Finnegan place representing the highest emotional cost. The progression from inert to alive to dying houses creates meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. The cost manifests in the "fragile, returning warmth" requiring deliberate sanctification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete discovery that human care animates spaces through displaced objects. The final insight—"The living ones weren't haunted; they were held"—reweights all prior observations without moralizing. The orris root as "vessel for a shard of hush" creates layered meaning about attention and presence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with controlled rhythm ("the bay's quiet curve where spring air hung like held breath"). The perceptual signature shows Elara's unique way of noticing ("streetlights daydreamed"). Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("hushed blaze") that slightly exceeds the established voice range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong information density with most lines doing multiple jobs. Rhythm varies naturally without algorithmic patterns. Deduction for scattered metaphoric density in non-peak moments ("creeping normality noticer," "hushed blaze") and one instance of elevated diction ("inadvertently profound") that creates mild register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of houses requiring sanctification through displaced objects offers a fresh angle on the haunted house trope. The specific synthesis of perfumer's orris root with bay setting creates non-obvious resonance. The transformation of "dying house" into "waking house" through deliberate ritual feels earned and original.</comment>
