<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation burns clear and her sacrifice of hoarded knowledge demonstrates genuine cost, but the time traveler Kael lacks development beyond plot function. The "carefully resourceful" trait manifests through concrete choices like using preserved spores and selecting which truth to surrender. Internal conflict peaks when she must pay the mountain's price, though Kael's skepticism feels perfunctory rather than character-driven.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara's sacrifice stabilizes the library's existence, with visible cost in her surrendered knowledge. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as botanical diary gaps, chronos-fern imagery, and the unheard symphony pattern build toward the final preservation. Causality tracks cleanly from diary research through negotiation to rescue, though the mountain's sentience arrives late without sufficient grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mount Veridian's labyrinthine interior creates genuine spatial pressure with "endless shelves" and "unstable corridors" that constrain the rescue path. The chronos-ferns and botanical diary function as micro-settings that enable passage through physical voids. Sensory detail concentrates on dust motes, green luminescence, and the bookstore's "unheard symphony," though tactile and olfactory senses remain underused.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Temporal pressure escalates from "minutes, not hours" through the mountain's demand for higher payment to successful rescue. Elara's agency drives the resolution through researching gaps, sacrificing knowledge, and enabling Kael's passage. The cost manifests concretely in blood-ink and surrendered truth, though Kael's rescue happens off-page without visible struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "unlearned lessons" and knowledge's price in humility, crystallizing in Elara's written truth: "some truths are not for keeping." The botanical diary's gaps mirror humanity's missing wisdom, while the symphony metaphor accumulates meaning from "unheard" through "swelled" to ongoing composition. The final image of Mount Veridian holding "infinite wisdom" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Voice maintains arcane linguist register with "temporal weave," "chronos-ferns," and "Root Tongue" fitting Elara's expertise. Dialogue between Elara and Kael feels functional but lacks subtext—his skepticism and her certainty play as positions rather than character. The narrative stance holds steady through urgency, though diction occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("reality's fabric").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("dust motes danced in the single shaft of light") but suffers from abstract phrasing like "temporal weave" and "reality's fabric" that dulls immediacy. Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Information density varies—some sentences do multiple jobs while others merely restate ("ensure the library's survival" follows the rescue itself).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of textual gaps as physical voids offers fresh synthesis, particularly when diary marginalia maps to mountain fractures. Elara's payment method—writing truth in blood-ink to fill gaps—transforms the expected rescue mission format. The "unheard symphony" metaphor and chronos-ferns create specific world texture, though the mountain's sentience feels somewhat derivative of fantasy conventions.</comment>
