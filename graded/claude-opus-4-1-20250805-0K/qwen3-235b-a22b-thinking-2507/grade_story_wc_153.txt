<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("the wound in her palm slick with fresh blood, and knew she couldn't last until moonrise without aid"). The final renunciation—choosing to heal rather than change the past—is earned through prior causality with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("fierce tenderness") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara chooses understanding over revision, with the shard transforming from "weapon" to "relic of fierce tenderness." The accumulative/textural lens holds as condensation messages build toward the revelation of the suspended moment. Cost is visible in the bleeding palm and emotional weight of accepting the irreversible. Slight deduction for the final paragraph's mild thematic echo about "the love that seeks understanding."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth functions as more than setting—roots become "skeletal windows" that enable the evocation, and moonlight's healing arrival constrains timing. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("humid breath fogged the air"). The shard's dual nature (wounds in twilight, heals in moonlight) creates genuine constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating condensation messages that deepen understanding: from fragments to the crucial "Hand on the gate" moment. The dominant stake—finding the moment before decision—tightens as each revelation costs Elara physically (bleeding) and emotionally ("feel the sister's regret as her own"). The moonlight's timing creates genuine pressure that forces acceptance rather than pursuit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that "some apologies live not in words spoken, but in the courage to stand in the space where they waited." The shard's transformation and the sister's unsent letters create resonant layers about communication's failures. Final image of Elara turning "toward the labyrinth's edge...whole" reweights the journey from seeking to accepting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with selective noticing ("roots snagging her cloak" during urgency). Voice maintains consistency through lyrical compression without losing clarity. Some register elevation in emotional peaks ("terrifying freedom of the choice before the choice") slightly strains the established voice but serves the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm variations and high information density. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("fierce tenderness" appears twice) and some filter-verb clustering ("She watched, breath held"). The long sentences effectively mirror the labyrinth's complexity but occasionally risk clarity. No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy elements (gargoyle shard, spirit evocation) with emotional truth about unspoken apologies. The specific detail of "unsent letters pressed against cold stone" and condensation messages forming words creates originality. The concept of seeking "the moment before" rather than changing outcomes offers a non-obvious angle on regret narratives.</comment>
