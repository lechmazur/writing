I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density builds through layered emotional transposition, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Aris shifts from solving emotion to carrying it.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's personality-borrowing trait creates genuine internal conflict, with embodied emotions through the halo fragment (doubling over, gasping). The shift from seeking mathematical control to accepting emotional flow is earned through visceral experience. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("mathematics of emotion") that could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Aris accepts carrying rather than solving emotions, with visible cost in abandoning their quest for control. The accumulative structure builds through transposed experiences to this earned stance. Deduction for slightly abstract conceptualization of the "mathematics of emotion" that weakens causal specificity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The workshop setting with its "discarded 'e's and fractured ampersands" creates atmosphere, and the halo fragment functions as micro-setting that constrains choice. The sensory detail ("ozone and burnt sugar") is selective and purposeful. However, the physical workshop space could more actively pressure the final decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal identity confusion to potential contamination of the entire town's printed materials. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as each transposed emotion deepens Aris's understanding. Cost is visible in abandoning the mathematical quest, though the middle section could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete experience of transposed empathy—emotion as "current flowing between souls" rather than solvable equation. The final image of continuing work while carrying others' voices resonates without stating a moral. Strong integration of theme with character arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("fingers stained with indigo ink and the residue of other people's voices"). The POV maintains consistency through Aris's specific way of noticing mathematical patterns in emotion. Minor register elevation in places ("lucid turbulence") that slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("language of angles and sorrow") and occasional abstract phrasing ("mathematics of emotion" appears multiple times). The writing serves the accumulative mode but has moments of mild overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a letterpress operator who absorbs personalities through their work is fresh, and the halo fragment as a tool for transposing empathy offers originality. The transformation from seeking control to accepting flow provides a non-obvious angle on empathy. Execution is specific to this character and setting.</comment>
