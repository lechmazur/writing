<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to honor her grandmother's legacy while serving her earthbound community is clear and consistent. The internal conflict between her lost dreams of observatories and her discovered purpose shows genuine complexity. However, the emotional progression relies heavily on retrospective summary rather than embodied present-moment struggle, and the final transformation feels slightly unearned given the limited present-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases building toward Elara's successful creation of flameless light. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as she transforms from earthbound disappointment to "gloriously, gently aloft," with visible community impact as cost paid. However, the heavy reliance on backstory (>30%) without sufficient present-frame micro-choices weakens causality, and the orientation arrives late (who/where/when not fully clear until ~150 words).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto with its mist and dripping saltwater creates vivid atmosphere that mirrors Elara's emotional state. The sea glass functions as micro-setting, constraining her choices through the need to find the perfect piece. Sensory details like "mist curling like phantom breath" and "saltwater dripped like slow time" effectively blend setting with theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—creating flameless light to serve the fire-fearing village—is clear but lacks present-scene escalation. The conflict remains largely internal and retrospective, with the actual polishing and village illumination happening without meaningful resistance or complication. The resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through present struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of finding purpose in limitation emerges organically through Elara's transformation from aspiring astronomer to earthbound light-bearer. The recurring motif of "light without fire" and the pearl of stillness concept effectively reweight at closure. The final image of being "gloriously, gently aloft" while earthbound offers genuine resonance without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lyrical voice creates distinctive texture through phrases like "serpentine grotto" and "zephyr bloom," maintaining consistency throughout. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("liquid jade," "crushed emeralds kissed by moonbeams") that strains against the POV's grounded perspective. The lack of dialogue removes an opportunity for voice distinction, and some constructions feel artificially literary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Significant overwriting issues pervade the text, particularly metaphor density in high-pressure beats ("memories resurface" appears twice verbatim, mixed metaphors like "weight of longing settled in her palms"). Template cadence runs appear in the village scene ("Children gasped... elders smiled... Elara watched"). The prose achieves moments of beauty but sacrifices clarity and momentum to ornamental language.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of sea glass as memory vessels for starlight offers a fresh angle on the light-bearer archetype. The specific detail of wartime blackouts grounding the grandmother's practice adds authenticity. However, the execution relies on familiar grief-and-legacy patterns without sufficient transformation, and the final uplift feels somewhat predictable.</comment>
