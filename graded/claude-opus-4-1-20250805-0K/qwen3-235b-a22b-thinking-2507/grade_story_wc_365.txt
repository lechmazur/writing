I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where sensory layers build toward Elara's revelation about Lyra's sacrifice. The density of perception and the kaleidoscopic weaving create pressure through accumulation rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's sensory cartography creates a distinctive character voice, and her contradictory impulses between following Lyra and accepting her sacrifice play out viscerally in scene. The moment where she "wouldn't redirect away from this truth" shows earned acceptance with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("crushing pressure in Elara's chest") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's acceptance of Lyra's sacrifice transforms grief into purpose—"carrying the weight not as a burden, but as a compass." The accumulative lens holds as sensory layers build to revelation. Cost is visible in both Lyra's sacrifice and Elara's transformed burden. Slight deduction for dense opening that delays full orientation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned bay functions as more than setting—it's a palimpsest of realities that constrains and enables Elara's search. Vivid sensory detail ("ghost-vibration of ozone," "viscous coolant") filtered through Elara's perceptual expertise. The green glass shard as micro-setting directly enables the weaving that drives the story.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as realities layer and bleed together, culminating in witnessing Lyra's sacrifice. The "cyclically spontaneous" machinery creates physical danger (hydraulic arm) that raises stakes. Cost is unmistakable in Lyra's voluntary obliteration and Elara's inherited burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of weaving between worlds to understand sacrifice versus betrayal. The final image of the bay as "a single thread in the vast, fragile tapestry of worlds" resonantly answers the central question without moralizing. Lyra's sacrifice gains thematic weight as love choosing "oblivion over chaos."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—Elara experiences reality as "sensory maps" and "echoes of experience." Prose rhythm modulates effectively from contemplative opening to frantic vision sequence. Some elevated diction ("pallid light," "chroniton decay") fits the SF setting but occasionally distances.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and controlled rhythm. However, several instances of elevated register ("residual chroniton decay," "cyclically spontaneous nature") and some abstract phrasing ("crushing pressure," "profound, resonant gravity") that could be more concrete. No major loops or scaffolding, but density sometimes obscures momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dimensional travel as sensory perception rather than physical movement. The concept of a "sensory map maker" reading emotional residue in transitional spaces offers genuine originality. Risk-taking in the dense, lyrical approach heightens the story's resonance (+0.3 within band).</comment>
