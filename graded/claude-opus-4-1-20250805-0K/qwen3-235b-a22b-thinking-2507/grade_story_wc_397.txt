<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation evolves from seeking death to understanding endings, with contradictory impulses (flee vs. understand) acting simultaneously in the parasol scene. The fold in patience manifests as embodied surrender rather than abstract concept. Minor deduction for slight therapy-speak ("near-death clarity") but the final choice to listen rather than flee carries visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration achieved through Elara's crystallized understanding that endings are "woven into the fabric of waiting itself," with the glacier's calving sound providing closure. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and repeated trawling build toward this reconfiguration. Cost is legible in her acceptance of living within endings rather than fleeing them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina setting constrains every choice—from trawling debris to the ice crack that forces revelation. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's altered perception post-euthanasia attempt. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting that triggers the grandmother vision and grounds her return to reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation operates through accumulative pressure—each shovelful, each sound builds toward the ice crack revelation. The near-miss with the fissure forces stance crystallization: she hadn't been hearing endings approach but was already within them. Stakes tighten from seeking death to learning endings' language, with visible cost in her transformed relationship to destruction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring sound motif—from "windborne solace" to the glacier's "high, pure vibration"—reweighting endings as grace rather than terror. The parasol tip bridges destroyed present and lost past without stating meaning. Final image of Elara breathing in the calving sound offers non-literal answer to whether one can learn to hear endings approach.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how reality "gripped loosely" with edges blurring "like watercolor in rain." Voice modulates effectively from fractured perception to crystalline understanding. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("perpetual waiting," "tenuous") slightly outside stressed POV lexicon, but rhythm control under pressure remains strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"sterile clinic air sharp with antiseptic and the ghost of failed euthanasia" establishes setting, backstory, and tone simultaneously. Some elevated diction ("fleeting calm earned only through motion") and occasional abstract phrasing ("fold in patience") create minor friction. No loops or scaffolding, momentum sustained throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Failed euthanasia leaving someone "adrift in a body that felt borrowed" offers fresh angle on near-death experience. The specific synthesis of Arctic disaster relief with death-seeking creates non-obvious resonance. Risk-taking in the fractured reality perception and the quiet, acceptance-based ending heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
