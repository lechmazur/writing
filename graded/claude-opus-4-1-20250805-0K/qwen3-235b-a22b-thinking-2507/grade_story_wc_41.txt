<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's contradictory nature as a "precognitively forgetful" prophet creates genuine internal conflict, with his desperate physical actions (scraping chalk, arranging driftwood) embodying his struggle against cognitive dissolution. The final moment where he forgets why he holds chalk while the meaning drains away demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fog, forgetting, and searching accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where finding then losing the sound crystallizes Silas's eternal loop. The cost is legible in "stood empty-handed, the tidal longing a hollow tide within him," though the circular structure slightly softens the before/after distinction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden functions as both setting and constraint, with driftwood markers being erased by living fog that "reshapes the garden." Specific details like "a chair of bent rebar, a clock with no hands" create a vivid junkyard aesthetics, while the final ribcage sculpture where the crucial water drop falls makes environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating losses—forgetting the tire swing location, seeing "the log, then static," finally losing the plink's meaning entirely. The dominant stake of capturing proof before forgetting tightens as each attempt dissolves, though the circular nature prevents a fully decisive foreclosure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of time's erosion emerges through concrete particulars—the plink as "sound of a second passing, of water wearing stone"—without stating morals. The final image of dawn bringing repetition reweights all prior searching as both futile and necessary, achieving resonance through the specific rather than abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric density with distinctive phrasings like "precognitively forgetful" and "tidal longing," while free indirect style cleanly tracks Silas's degrading cognition. The perceptual signature of noticing echoes and vibrations while losing their meaning creates character-specific texture throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose density serves the accumulative mode with lines like "fog curled around sculptures he'd built from salvage," though occasional redundancy appears ("desperate to mark the spot, to trap the resonance"). Some filter constructions ("He saw the log, then static. He saw his own hands") create mild drag but support the disorientation pattern. Template cadence in the "He saw...He saw" sequence triggers -0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The paradox of prophetic forgetting offers a fresh angle on memory loss, with specific details like "videotapes left unwatched" and the water-drop-on-mirror sound avoiding generic treatment. The circular structure where forgetting enables perpetual searching transforms a potentially grim premise into something more complex.</comment>
