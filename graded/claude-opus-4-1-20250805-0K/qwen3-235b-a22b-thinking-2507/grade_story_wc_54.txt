<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like tracing conduits and using the sextant piece, with internal conflict between practical engineering and deeper hope visible throughout. The character demonstrates competence balanced with genuine struggle, though emotional complexity could deepen further. Her final choice to document and share findings shows earned progression with visible cost (abandoning the easier path of pure demolition).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's transformation of decay into possibility, with the sextant piece enabling literal circuit redirection that mirrors thematic renewal. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details build toward the final image of "redirecting hope." Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and causality tracks cleanly. Cost is visible in the contrast between "tomb of ambition" and active resurrection, though the emotional price could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The terminal setting actively constrains and enables choices—corroded panels require creative solutions, maintenance tunnels provide geothermal energy, carnival detritus marks temporal layers. Sensory detail balances effectively (ozone/popcorn, sparks hissing, dust choking) and spatial choreography remains coherent. The sextant piece functions as micro-setting that directly enables the circuit solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake of resurrecting dead systems escalates from exploration to active repair to systemic modeling, with the sextant discovery providing the crucial turning point. Agency manifests through Elara's decision to redirect rather than abandon, with visible cost in choosing difficult renewal over easier departure. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as each technical success deepens commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of redirecting flows—both literal circuits and metaphorical hope—without explicit moralizing. The sextant transforms from navigation tool to calibration instrument, earning its symbolic weight through practical use. The final image of stars mirroring the computer's glow offers resonant closure that reweights the entire "maze of intentions" into unified purpose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent engineering precision ("bypassed burnt fuses," "fluid dynamics with structural physics") while allowing lyrical moments ("fireflies," "stoic wonder"). POV remains stable with appropriate perceptual filtering through Elara's technical lens. Minor register elevation in philosophical passages ("entropy into order") occasionally strains against the established practical voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with most sentences advancing multiple layers, though some abstraction creeps in ("equations for hope" appears 4 times creating mild redundancy). Several passages edge toward overwriting ("monument to fleeting joy," "canvas for creation") without pattern-teaching. Line-level craft is generally clean but occasional template cadence emerges ("She ran...She pocketed...She needed").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of engineering pragmatism with emotional archaeology feels fresh—using a navigation tool to redirect power circuits shows genuine ingenuity. The specific detail of carnival remains overlaying space-age ruins creates memorable texture. Risk-taking in the quiet, technical closure pays off by avoiding expected dramatic confrontation.</comment>
