<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to transform trauma into healing through acoustic calibration is clear and embodied through concrete actions. His internal state shows through the storm glass vial's responses and his methodical adjustments, though some emotional transitions feel slightly summarized ("not from pain, but release"). The final transformation from "companion rather than void" shows earned change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through sound/silence imagery building to Silas's harmonic intervention. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the "vaulting hush" transforms from brittle waiting to living comfort, with cost visible in the collective grief being processed. The orientation anchors clearly (gondola operator, prism terrace, post-derailment Venice), though the worldbuilding occasionally obscures the emotional arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace functions as both setting and constraint—its acoustic vulnerability shapes every choice Silas makes. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("fractured light painting his hands in transient hues"), with the storm glass vial serving as micro-setting that constrains action. The crystalline architecture directly enables the story's central conceit of sound-as-healing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from monitoring brittle silence to actively transforming it through calibrated humming, with the prisms' vulnerability providing constant pressure. The 32-35 decibel sweet spot creates concrete constraint, and Silas's agency drives the transformation. Cost appears in the collective trauma being processed and the risk of shattering, though the resolution feels slightly frictionless.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the silence-as-comfort transformation without explicit moralizing. The storm glass vial's clearing mirrors the city's emotional state effectively. The final image of the terrace no longer holding its breath resonates without stating meaning directly, though "taught it to comfort" edges toward thematic articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent POV with distinctive perceptual signature ("fluidly logical" movements, technical acoustic awareness). Diction fits the elevated setting while remaining accessible. Some phrases feel overwrought ("vaulting hush pressing against crystal facets"), but rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly during the humming sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density with most sentences doing multiple jobs. However, several metaphoric constructions feel strained ("silence must breathe to comfort"), and there's occasional template cadence ("He'd studied...He'd carry..."). The "fluidly logical" repetition works as pattern but borders on excessive. Line-level craft is competent but occasionally purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The acoustic-healing concept through prism terraces offers fresh synthesis of Venice-gondola imagery with speculative elements. The storm glass barometer and decibel calibration create specific, non-obvious details. While the trauma-to-healing arc is familiar, the execution through sound physics and crystalline architecture shows genuine invention.</comment>
