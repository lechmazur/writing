<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is crystal clear and intensifies through concrete embodied actions—the drumming as coded communication, the desperate attempt to sustain Lyra's presence. The contradictory impulses (hope vs. grief, rebellion vs. clinical compliance) act simultaneously in scene, particularly when she pours "every ounce of her will" while the machines shriek warnings. The final cost—being left "utterly still" and "alone again with the machines"—is earned through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Elara's rebellion completes but fails, foreclosing the path to recovering Lyra with visible emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—the drumming pattern builds density, the lagoon's manifestation represents peak accumulation, and the final dissolution ("the lagoon under starlight was gone, leaving only the hollow ache") reweights all prior attempts. Cost is unmistakable in "the hollow ache of what could never be."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden functions as both setting and constraint—its crystalline resonators respond to Elara's drumming, translating "taps into visible sound waves that coiled like silver serpents." The auric lagoon's manifestation within the garden's core represents environment directly shaping possibility. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (the "cold stool," the "pulse-point of her own wrist"), though some descriptions edge toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—breathing life into Lyra's stolen vision—is signaled early and tightens through escalating drumming that builds to the lagoon's manifestation. The reversal when "monitors began to shriek" and the vision dissolves represents meaningful deepening that forecloses Elara's path. Cost is legible in the transition from "frantic, joyful rhythm" to hands "going still on the cold metal."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete tension between clinical "therapy" and Elara's "rebellion"—the attempt to resurrect what technology insists is "irretrievable." The final image of Elara "alone again with the machines" offers a resonant, non-literal answer about grief's persistence and technology's limits. The auric lagoon functions as more than symbol—it constrains choice and charges the closure when it vanishes "taking Lyra's warmth with it."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinct lyrical register with controlled rhythm that modulates with intensity—from measured opening to "frantic, joyful rhythm" to final stillness. The perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices through sound and vibration ("the universe inhaling," "rhythm only she and the dying stars understood"). No dialogue to evaluate, but internal texture remains coherent even under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density and purposeful rhythm, though figurative language occasionally overwhelms ("silver serpents," "dying stars," "auroral sorrow"). Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("the hush of the universe inhaling"), and there's mild redundancy in explaining the drumming's purpose. The final sentence achieves powerful propulsion through its triple structure ("the universe exhaled, and Elara...was alone again").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief therapy, sound-wave technology, and sister-consciousness is specific and non-obvious. The drumming as coded communication seeking "Lyra's frequency within the entangled memories" transforms the clinical setting uniquely. While memory-recovery narratives are common, the particular execution through harmonic resonance and the "auric lagoon" creates fresh inflection.</comment>
