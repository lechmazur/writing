<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters are well-motivated with clear internal conflict—Aris's calculation softening to empathy, Elena's grief transforming to purpose. The closure choice is earned through prior causality (Mateo's unacknowledged heroism, Aris's debt). Deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("his shrewdness softening into empathy") and slightly convenient emotional progression in the final third.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal drive with clear Decisive Change—from isolated grief to collaborative action. The envelope discovery catalyzes genuine transformation with visible cost (Aris confronting his exploitation, Elena sharing her brother's memory). Minor deduction for slightly mechanical resolution where both characters align too smoothly on the solution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting effectively constrains and enables—the library garden provides intimacy for vulnerable exchange, the envelope's water stain hints at maritime connection. Night-blooming jasmine and starlight charge emotional beats. The harbor/port world is vivid and specific. Slight deduction for some generic atmospheric touches ("sky dusted with stars").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from mistaken address to confronting systemic erasure of workers. The revelation about Mateo's medicine rerouting deepens conflict and forces Aris to reckon with his complicity. Cost is visible in Elena's grief and Aris's recognition of exploitation. Minor deduction for union objection being too quickly overcome.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between visible success (symphony, cargo empire) and invisible labor (Mateo's heroism). The locket photo and Project Silent Currents embody rather than state the theme. Strong resonance in "compassion multiplies when you see faces." Slight deduction for minor thematic echo in "cycles of compassion."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct voices—Aris's business calculation vs. Elena's quiet grief. Good perceptual signatures (cargo-trained eyes noting addresses, Elena's archival mindset). Dialogue carries subtext effectively. Deduction for some register elevation during emotional peaks ("cautious exuberance," "silent contributor") that doesn't fully match established voices.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Strong specific details (Port Authority Survivor Benefits, tide charts). Deductions for repetitive phrasing ("cautious exuberance" appears twice), some abstract emotional labeling ("his shrewdness softening into empathy"), and occasional overwriting in figurative language.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on labor invisibility through the mistaken envelope device. The synthesis of maritime commerce and library archives creates unexpected resonance. Specific details (Mateo rerouting medicine, union resistance) avoid generic treatment. The quiet memorial project feels earned rather than sentimental.</comment>
