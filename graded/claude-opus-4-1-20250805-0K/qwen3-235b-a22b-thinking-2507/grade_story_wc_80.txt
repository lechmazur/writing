<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied characterization with concrete details like "calloused hands" and physical struggle "muscles burning." The protagonist's motivation as "archeologist of abandoned dreams" drives meaningful choices, particularly when she discovers and preserves the watercolors. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("stoically sensitive awareness") that edges toward label-speak rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant closure through the pavilion's transformation from ruin to "testament tended." The discovery-documentation-preservation sequence creates meaningful change with visible cost (physical effort, emotional weight). The final image of "dreams archived within the stone" effectively reweights the opening's "interlaced absence" with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion functions as both setting and constraint, forcing specialized equipment and underwater work that shapes every action. Vivid sensory detail ("water resisting like cold silk," "sound like bones breaking") grounds the piece. The environment directly enables the story's resolution through the hidden cavity and watercolors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through physical struggle (wresting the cornerstone) to emotional discovery (watercolors revealing lost dreams). The protagonist's agency drives escalation from surveying to active preservation. Cost is visible in physical strain and the weight of inherited purpose, though the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of embedding memory in stone repairs—"suturing the present to the vanished past." The concept of "interlaced absence" gains complexity through physical discovery rather than abstraction. Final image resonates without moralizing, though some passages edge toward over-articulation ("archeologist of abandoned dreams").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and specific perceptual signature ("filtered light," "spectral columns"). Some elevated diction fits the contemplative tone but occasionally drifts toward purple prose ("hushed blaze of permanence"). POV remains stable with clear focalization throughout the underwater work.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong verbs ("wrested," "bracing," "levered"). Information density is high with most lines advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("hushed blaze," "stoically sensitive") and some repetitive phrasing around "abandoned dreams" and "interlaced absence."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle on archaeological preservation through underwater surveying with emotional stakes. The specific synthesis of technical work (surveying, documentation) with metaphysical purpose (preserving dreams) feels organic. The image of embedding memories directly into foundation repairs offers genuine originality, though some conceptual phrasing remains abstract.</comment>
