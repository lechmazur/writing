Looking at this story, I'll evaluate it under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** given its lyric density, pattern-based progression, and the way meaning accumulates through repeated imagery (amber, coins, static) toward a resonant reconfiguration at closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's role as "cast lots decision maker" drives genuine agency through ritualized choice-making, with Sori providing quiet counterpoint. The final integration of randomness with purpose ("I was the cast lots decision maker because causality ran uphill here") shows earned understanding with visible cost—the surrender of conventional causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The backwards prophecy structure creates coherent accumulative pressure, with the dome's transformation and corridor opening serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration. Cost is felt through the surrender to reversed causality ("matter following the memo"). However, the conceptual density occasionally obscures immediate stakes, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck functions as active setting—the dome that must be turned, dilated, and transformed. Sensory specificity ("black dew," "honeyed dome," coins that "rang like compact planets") creates lived-in texture. The environment directly constrains choices through the prophecy's spatial requirements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes build through the backwards prophecy's three-part requirement, forcing sequential actions that accumulate meaning. The tension between randomness and purpose creates genuine pressure. However, the abstract nature of the conflict ("understanding static bursts") limits visceral engagement despite the coherent escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of finding purpose in randomness—"casting lots was not abdication but a way to crack the amber of intention." The final image of facing "the hush, understanding static bursts as prayer and purpose" offers resonant closure without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("stellar doubt pooled at our feet like black dew"). The perceptual signature remains consistent, though occasional density threatens clarity ("the universe, not expanding but remembering itself"). No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice maintains coherent texture throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly lands ("coins rang like compact planets"), but density occasionally overwhelms ("a shoreless feeling, that we were already on the far side of our choice"). Some conceptual abstraction dulls momentum ("understanding static bursts, and letting the snow speak syllables of rearranged time").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The backwards prophecy concept genuinely refreshes time-travel tropes through specific execution—prophecy that reads in reverse, requiring trust before action. The synthesis of randomness with determinism ("causality ran uphill here") feels both surprising and inevitable. Risk-taking with temporal structure heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
