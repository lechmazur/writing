I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the Accumulative/Textural drive lens that best fits this lyric, image-driven narrative.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's grief over their brother's suicide provides clear motivation, with embodied emotions like "palm damp and expectant" and "a familiar door in my chest lift and breathe." The guardian's characterization through silent action is compelling. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("shame tried retreating") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator receives the dental mirror as a tool "when speaking failed," crystallizing their transformation from seeking to learning how to help others. The cost is felt through the brother's "refusing the old pull" and the narrator's voice returning "like floodwater." The accumulative pattern of light-weaving builds coherently to this earned stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, canal, and narrow houses create a vivid, constraining environment that shapes every action. The dental mirror becomes essential micro-setting, enabling the guardian's light-weaving that drives the story. Sensory details like "tar and nettle" and "rope snoring" are selective and purposeful, directly supporting the hushed, liminal atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulating images of the guardian's light-work, from healing the barge pilot to opening "rooms where grief lay like folded sails." The narrator's internal conflict between seeking answers about their brother and learning to help others provides clear escalation. The cost manifests in accepting the brother's refusal rather than forcing resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the guardian's silent teaching about "light too shy to arrive" and using "silent empathy the way other men used keys." The final image of keeping "the dental mirror cupped, a small star I would use when speaking failed" resonantly answers the central question about processing grief without forcing closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric compression ("Rain left the dock the color of cobalt, slick as a whispered oath"). The perceptual signature remains consistent through selective noticing of light, water, and subtle movements. No dialogue maintains the hushed atmosphere perfectly, with communication through gesture and mirror-work feeling inevitable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong prose rhythm with varied sentence lengths creating breathing space ("We waited. He walked. I watched."). Information density is high, with lines like "spiralingly calm" doing multiple jobs. Minor deductions for occasional abstract constructions ("shame tried retreating") and slight overuse of figurative language in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of a silent canal guardian who heals through reflected light and shutter patterns is genuinely original. The specific synthesis of grief, water, light-weaving, and silent empathy creates something memorable. Risk-taking in the no-dialogue approach and lyric compression heightens rather than obscures meaning (+0.3 within band).</comment>
