I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through layered imagery and ritual repetition, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration when the courier accepts their role as "planting continuance in the clefts of ordinary life."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The courier's jittery nature contrasts effectively with their need for stillness in their work, creating genuine internal tension. The widow's grief is embodied through concrete details ("face already half bright and half memory"). Minor deduction for the mentor's wisdom feeling slightly abstract in places, though the final acceptance of loss lands with authentic cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from delivery routine through ritual communion to earned understanding of the courier's true purpose. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the protagonist accepts both their mentor's absence and their role as continuance-planter. The "corridor" sequence where widow and lost man overlap provides clear emotional cost. Slight deduction for the conceptual heaviness in the final third that borders on explanation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory layering: the aurora "pouring into snow like sap returning to old wood," the ridge humming "like a tuning fork." The ridgeway functions as more than setting—it actively participates in the ritual, singing "a low green note." The bone tube's warmth "as if someone were whispering into the marrow" perfectly integrates object and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—creating meaningful connection between the living and dead—intensifies through the ritual's careful orchestration. The corridor's necessary thinning ("miracles should not be kept past their flavor") provides genuine cost. However, the conflict remains primarily internal and procedural rather than dramatically contested, limiting escalation under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of wonder coaxed from routine, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final insight about "planting continuance in the clefts of ordinary life" reweights the entire piece without stating a thesis. The parallel between the courier's loss of their mentor and the widow's grief creates layered resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice balances lyrical compression ("maps bleach into sky") with grounded specificity. The perceptual signature is consistent—someone attuned to vibrations and subtle frequencies. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("germinate in the shared membrane") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon during non-peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, particularly in the ritual sequence. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deduction for two instances of abstract phrasing ("shared membrane of palm and parcel," "fade from memory to myth") that momentarily blur concrete clarity, and one paraphrase loop around the mentor's teachings.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of a courier who extends encounters between objects and their meaning offers genuine freshness. The specific synthesis of delivery work with spiritual mediumship feels non-obvious yet inevitable. The dragonfly-wing pendant as a tuning instrument and the bone tube containing yew seeds show imaginative specificity beyond template choices.</comment>
