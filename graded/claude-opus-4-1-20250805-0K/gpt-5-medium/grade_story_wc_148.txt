<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's identity as "cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son" creates a compelling inherited burden that drives the pursuit of "truer bell" through the lighthouse confession system. Internal contradiction between seeking hush and needing to control narrative manifests concretely through the lattice's mediation. The final choice to guide through selective truth shows earned agency, though the woman character remains underdeveloped as pressure source.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds through copperlight imagery, confession layers, and the lattice's transformative filtering toward a Charged Poise closure where the narrator positions himself as lens-keeper who will "answer in the measured way of a lens rotating." The "drain held answers that were not yet bodies" creates urgent stakes with visible cost in choosing how truth emerges. Early orientation anchors solidly by line 3, though the "thread a labyrinth with your own story" shifts between self and reader address without clear purpose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse-prison's paradox of "cells that looked outward" where prisoners "see what they were not touching" transforms setting into thematic engine. Copper heat, salt-greened locks, and gulls' verdict-laughter create visceral atmosphere that constrains movement and perception. The lattice functions as micro-setting that literally filters confession, making environment essential to the narrator's final positioning as truth-mediator.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal inheritance ("false alarms for a truer bell") through discovering the drain's hidden answers to the imminent boat arrival demanding explanations. The narrator's shift from passive seeker to active controller of narrative flow shows agency under pressure. Cost remains somewhat abstract in "steering the current" rather than showing specific forfeitures, though the weight of inherited lies creates palpable burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse as repository of "impossibilities...like a jar keeps a firefly: briefly, tenderly" transforms prison architecture into meditation on truth's containment. The lattice's squares becoming "doors" with narrator as "tide turning the knobs" creates resonant answer to the inheritance of false warnings. Theme emerges through concrete details rather than abstraction, though "thread a labyrinth with your own story" edges toward explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice weaves maritime ("reef kept its teeth ready"), architectural ("corridors were the ribs of a whale"), and confessional registers into coherent texture. The shift to direct address "thread a labyrinth with your own story" creates purposeful slippage that charges the narrative frame. Perceptual signature strong in transforming ordinary details: stairs "warm as coins," surf "speaking in a low sleepwalk."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose maintains high density with images doing multiple jobs: "copperlight repose" establishes both atmosphere and thematic state. Strong syntactic variety from short declarations ("I kept rowing back") to complex accumulations. Minor template repetition in "I told her" sequence and the "your own story" pronoun inconsistency, but momentum remains strong through musical cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse-prison with outward-facing cells inverts expected carceral architecture brilliantly. Inherited guilt manifesting as pursuit of "hush" rather than silence offers fresh angle on confession narrative. The lattice as salvaged confessional screen that transforms into control mechanism shows genuine synthesis of elements into non-obvious configuration.</comment>
