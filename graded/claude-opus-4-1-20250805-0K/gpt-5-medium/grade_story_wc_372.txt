I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds meaning through layered imagery, repetition, and density shifts rather than strict causal progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation crystallizes through embodied details like "mittened hands" steadying the lantern and breathing slowing "until the hues aligned." The final vow to "name the unnamed and file their shadows" emerges from accumulated pressure rather than sudden epiphany, with visible cost as the protagonist becomes "another entry, but also the keeper."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the protagonist accepts guardianship, transforming from clerk to "guardian of resonances." The cost is explicit: "I became another entry" shows permanent binding to the dying library. The accumulative structure coheres through repeated sampling/measuring motifs that culminate in the final vow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The frozen library functions as active constraint throughout—"frost clinging to ledger edges," "icicles spelled alphabets." The magic lantern slide enables key turns, from projecting the mentor's fractured pledge to revealing the second slide that demands "a final entry." The setting's decay ("silence gnawed the edges of our stacks") pressures the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating absences: colleagues departed, mentor's vow fracturing, library demanding its final clause. The dominant stake—preserving meaning against oblivion—tightens when "no witness stood near" forces solitary choice. Cost manifests physically as "birds wheeled into me, sewing light through the seams."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and dissolution without explicit moralizing. The final image of constellations rearranging to "a steadier grammar" resonates as non-literal answer to whether meaning can survive entropy. The mentor standing "beside me in the refraction" suggests continuity through transformation rather than simple preservation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive texture through inventive compounds ("irridial sheen," "translucencies between tombstones") and consistent perceptual signature focused on light, frequency, and measurement. The lyric compression serves the accumulative design, with no head-hopping and clean psychic distance throughout the mystical elements.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional abstraction dulls momentum ("meaning did not arrive as words"). The repetition of "by sampling frequencies" functions as taught pattern rather than loop. Some metaphoric density in peak beats ("snow scraped sequins from the clouds") risks opacity but maintains coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of archival duty with mystical preservation offers fresh angle on familiar "last guardian" trope. Specific details like measuring vows through "frequencies of light and hush" and the library as conscious entity demanding its own preservation elevate beyond template. Risk-taking through dense lyric mode heightens rather than obscures stakes.</comment>
