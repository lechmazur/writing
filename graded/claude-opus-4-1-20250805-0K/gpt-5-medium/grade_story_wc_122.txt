<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to defeat numbness is embodied through tactile seeking and the physical act of threading silence. Her choice to teach "listening backward to move forward" shows earned transformation with visible cost (the frost admitting it was water). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around emotional states ("frost beneath the ribs") that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Mara transforms from fearing numbness to carrying "hush" as presence that enables teaching. The backward recording sequence creates textural density that reweights silence from absence to "a way for presence to travel." Cost is felt through the frost/water transformation and her students' future tenderness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cavern functions as setting that constrains and enables—its acoustic properties ("basalt swallowed sound into velvet") make the backward recording possible. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("smoke, salt, and old rain"). The drumhead-as-record transformation and the cavern's "harbor of not-sound" directly shape the closure's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation occurs through textural accumulation: from seeking drums to threading the needle to recording backward to discovering "the filament of hush." Each step deepens rather than reverses, consistent with the accumulative lens. The cost manifests as Mara confronting her own numbness ("she had already stopped without noticing") before she can teach others.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of backward listening to move forward, never stated but enacted. The final image of frost admitting it was water resonantly answers the numbness question without moralizing. Subtext operates through gesture (Oko's grin "teeth pale as shells") and the cavern bowing back.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic perception ("read his palms the way others read lips"). Purposeful compression and lyric elision work well ("During the faint rustle of turning seasons"). Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that strains the POV ("enthrall her scars like a tide unwinding").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and information density, with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some overwriting in figurative language appears too frequently in peak beats ("filament of hush," "spiral," "stylus of bone" in rapid succession). Template cadence appears briefly ("She imagined...She saw...She believed") though it doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of teaching rhythm through deafness offers a fresh angle, transformed through specific details like reading palms for communication. The backward recording as a path to feeling is non-obvious and earned. The synthesis of silence as presence rather than absence feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
