I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered discoveries and resonant repetitions toward a reconfigured understanding.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's methodically playful approach manifests through concrete actions (tapping the nickel, timing breath to its ridges), and the final acceptance of questions over certainty shows earned change. Internal contradiction appears when fearing "perfect restoration erases the hands that kept living" while actively seeking lighter burdens. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("the map keeps unfolding") in the resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator exchanges certainty for curiosity, with visible cost in accepting incomplete knowledge. The accumulative structure coheres through nested discoveries (sketch→glaze→secret), each awakening deepening the central question. The "pause between question and reply" pattern creates rhythmic escalation. Slight opacity around the exact nature of the sound-activated restoration technique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The parabolic garden's acoustic properties constrain the restoration method (sound bewitches binder), making setting essential to technique. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("pigments trembled into awareness"). The hobo nickel's carved star and ridges get tactile specificity. Some spatial choreography remains vague (exact positioning relative to the curved walls).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: from faithful restoration to embracing uncertainty, with each revealed layer (mason's daughter, dancing pair) raising questions about preservation versus erasure. The wall's question "what would you rather not know" forces the narrator's pivotal admission. Cost appears in accepting incomplete understanding rather than certainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of restoration layers revealing hidden histories. The grandfather's teaching that "the best maps are small enough to carry" resonates with accepting lighter burdens of uncertainty. The final image of continuous awakening through questions effectively reweights the opening's methodical precision into openness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice blends technical restoration vocabulary with lyrical perception ("pigments woke like eyelids, thin as moth wings"). The perceptual signature shows in how sound becomes tactile ("the question leapt the air and stroked my cheek"). Consistent POV with controlled psychic distance. Some register elevation in peak moments ("bewitched the binder") fits the methodically playful character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs (the nickel as straightedge/oracle/bell). Some repetitive phrasing around "pause between question and reply" becomes pattern rather than loop. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("I asked...and the echo") but serves accumulative design. Minor scaffold in "In gratitude I set" construction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art restoration with acoustic properties as metaphor for accepting uncertainty. The hobo nickel as inherited talisman carrying grandfather's wisdom avoids cliché through specific details (star carved with needle file). The concept of "nested awakenings" through sound creates an original approach to the transformation narrative.</comment>
