<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal journey from artistic failure to keeper shows clear motivation with embodied emotion ("luminescent ache that happens after a bruise"). Her choice to keep the light demonstrates agency with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("necessary darkness") but the final commitment lands with earned causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara becomes the keeper. The closure lands with visible cost ("I will keep the light tonight, and I will keep the faces that come to it"). Threading the cards to fix the wick provides causal linkage. Orientation anchors establish lighthouse library early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse library constrains choices through its decay and tools (ledger, cards, twine). Sensory detail is selective ("smelled of oil, linen, and letters no hand would ever finish"). The gearhouse and its broken wick directly enable the resolution. Some abstract moments but setting actively shapes the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal artistic crisis to taking responsibility for the lighthouse. The threading discovery deepens options and Mara's agency drives the resolution. Cost is visible in her commitment to keep the light. One meaningful tightening through the wick repair that forecloses her return to the city.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of creative renewal through accepting darkness emerges from concrete actions. The keeper's "Only by untangling threads can the light know where to go" gains resonance through Mara's literal and metaphorical untangling. Final image of being "stitched to the weather" offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("She had come because the city had turned her faces into masks and her hands into moths"). Some elevated diction fits the reflective mode. Minor register drift in places ("fragmented reality, a mosaic missing its grout") but maintains coherent perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments of compressed imagery but some overwriting in metaphor density ("lighthouse clicked its cracked lens like a tongue trying to remember a prayer"). Several abstract constructions ("necessary darkness," "luminescent ache") and occasional register elevation. Information density is high but some figurative excess in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper role with artistic crisis. The threading of tarot cards as navigation system shows originality. Some familiar elements (artist seeking renewal) but transformed through specific details like the keeper's marginalia and the thread-mapping system.</comment>
