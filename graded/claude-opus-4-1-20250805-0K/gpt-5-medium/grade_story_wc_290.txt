I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through layered imagery (compass point as inheritance, organ as city-voice, spatial mutiny) building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist realizes the mutiny is "not refusal, only a hunger to be heard."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The claustrophobic explorer who "keeps walking anyway" shows clear internal contradiction embodied through action. The protagonist makes concrete micro-choices (signaling the sexton, pricking geometric patterns, choosing to wear the key openly) that reveal values under pressure. Minor deduction for the final realization feeling slightly neat, though the "hunger to be heard" lands with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the final telescope revelation reweights the entire spatial mutiny concept—from antagonist to fellow sufferer. The accumulative structure coheres through organ/geometry/key progression with clear cost (risking Council censure by wearing the artifact). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3. The lens holds throughout without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of setting as active constraint—the "shadowed nexus" literally shifts and responds to organ music, forcing specific navigation tactics. The compass point becomes both tool and inherited wisdom ("maps were promises that rooms made with the sky"). The fountain's silt, Observatory lock, and telescope all constrain or enable key choices, elevating this beyond mere description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure: from entering the mutinous space, to negotiating with it via organ/geometry, to risking Council censure, to the final revelation. The "tightness rise behind my ribs" and "inventing a larger room with every exhale" show embodied cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist chooses open rebellion over hiding the key.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of spatial mutiny as communication failure. The grandmother's belief about maps as "promises" and the final revelation that mutiny is "hunger to be heard" create resonant non-literal answers. The wistful rebellion of wearing the forbidden key openly adds moral complexity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with consistent lyric compression ("Night spread a thinning velvet") and specific perceptual signature (measuring breath "like a diver's," seeing alleys as "sleepers turning"). The controlled rhythm accelerates during the fountain search and telescope discovery. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor compression under stress ("Cold bit until I felt metal") maintains coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("I am prudently adventurous, which means I bring chalk, patience, and an exit strategy"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph breaks. Deduction for occasional elevated diction that slightly strains POV credibility ("shadowed nexus," "spatial mutiny") and one instance of slight overwriting in the opening, though these don't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of city spaces having agency and hunger for communication is fresh. The specific synthesis of organ music as negotiation tool and inherited compass point as promise-holder feels non-obvious. The Observatory telescope pointed "down the city's throat" to "listen to gravities" shows genuine imaginative reach. Slight deduction for the resolution's tidiness.</comment>
