<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "defy the gravity of hopelessness" through "serious playfulness" creates a consistent character philosophy that drives choices throughout. The collaboration with Lark shows earned trust through shared action rather than declaration. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("gravity of hopelessness") that could be more embodied, though the final beats land with concrete sensory detail of children catching soot seeds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught elements (chanting, filtering, ambient awareness) that build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where fireworks transform communal despair into possibility. The closure lands with visible cost through "filtering fear from the crowd" and the gravity "not vanquished, but persuaded." The mosaic note provides causal linkage to the fire sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fortress setting actively constrains and enables choices—moonflowers/vines conceal tools, walls provide launch points, wind patterns guide placement. Exceptional integration of sensory detail ("moonflowers...opened wide like listening mouths") that mirrors internal states without forcing symbolism. The environment transforms from oppressive to celebratory through the protagonists' actions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of defeating communal hopelessness escalates from discovery (finding the knot) through preparation (mixing salts, mapping echoes) to execution (lighting sequence). Cost is visible in the careful "filtering" work and the gravity that must be "persuaded" rather than conquered. Strong agency throughout, though the conflict could push harder against the protagonists.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of fireworks as prayer/instruction, with "serious playfulness" as method for engaging suffering. The final image of blooms drinking ash to "retell this note in mosaic" offers a non-literal answer about how art transforms pain. Subtext operates beautifully in the kerosene knot as "heart that had not yet decided to open."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("humming the road and measuring the air with my feet"). The perceptual signature of filtering and ambient awareness creates character-specific observation. Some elevated diction ("ramparts," "parapet") fits the fairy-tale register though occasionally distances. Dialogue remains minimal but effective when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of abstract phrasing weaken immediacy ("gravity of hopelessness," "patient shape"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in the preparation sequence ("At the western tower...At the cistern...") though it creates intentional ritual rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of fireworks-as-communal-healing with the specific detail of the mosaic note as musical instruction feels fresh and earned. The concept of "serious playfulness" offers a non-obvious approach to addressing despair. Risk-taking in the lyric mode and compressed timeframe heightens the mythic quality without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
