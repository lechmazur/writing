I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered repetition, crystalline imagery, and the circular return of "after the last echo of laughter fades."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's mnemonic gift creates genuine internal tension between preserving faces and losing their stories, embodied through charcoal-stained hands that won't clean. The final choice to uncork creativity and bring hidden work to light shows earned change through accumulated grief and calling, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("auroral sorrow").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure with the circular frame creating resonant reconfiguration—the protagonist moves from packing away to unpacking suppressed work, with the strongbox opening through drawn tumblers showing imaginative causality. The cost is visible in years of creative suppression and Vera's death, though the final "door beneath home" lands as conceptual repricing with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The crystal cave constrains choice brilliantly—faces trapped in facets, the broken lock requiring artistic solution, violet/green shards providing otherworldly light. The subterranean setting literalizes the "calling beneath the city" and makes the hidden creativity physical, with mineral air and stalagmite details grounding the fantastical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from surface portraiture to descending stairs to confronting the broken lock to the final uncorking. The drawn tumblers solving the mechanical problem shows agency through art, and the cost appears in "years of moving" the painting and suppressing creativity for "the economy of survival."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between commercial art and "wild drawings," with the cave as literal underground for suppressed creativity. The final image of "a door beneath home" resonantly answers whether one can honor both survival and calling without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("charcoal-fingered portrait sketch artist") and controlled rhythm that modulates from melancholic opening to breathless cave description. The perceptual signature shows in how the narrator reads faces like "streets in a town I can walk blindfolded," though occasional elevation ("auroral sorrow") slightly exceeds the POV's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with lines doing multiple jobs ("the iron strongbox with the broken combination lock sits like a riddle we abandoned"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("gentle rain through the cavern like warm tinnitus") creates slight opacity, and "mnemonically gifted" appears twice in close succession.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of art literally unlocking art (drawing tumblers to fix broken lock) offers genuine originality, as does the crystal cave holding sketched faces. The synthesis of boardwalk artist with hidden magical realist space feels fresh, and the risk of fantastical elements heightens rather than obscures the emotional stakes.</comment>
