<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rafi's trauma response to helicopter sounds ("the white noise wrapped his ribs in wire") shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and his final choice to fold the photograph "steady as a trellis in wind" demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost. The somatic marker techniques and Leda's parallel patience create authentic character dynamics under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through repeated trauma triggers (vent fans, helicopter, photograph) until Rafi achieves Earned Stasis—continuing his work while holding trauma differently. The closure lands with felt cost when he folds the photograph "the paper new only in the way his hands now held it," though the extended backstory exposition weakens causality in places.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The arboretum's glass roofs breathing "salt and sap" and the automated lighthouse blinking like a "metronome" establish vivid setting that constrains Rafi's healing choices. The environment actively participates through vent fans triggering flashbacks and the cliff path where the gull rescue occurs, though some descriptive passages could sharpen specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from managing daily triggers to the helicopter-induced freeze during the gull rescue, where Leda's voice becomes the bridge allowing Rafi to act despite paralysis. The final photograph unfolding with the lighthouse keeper's niece deepens the dominant stake of building "rooms that storms could enter without wrecking," with visible cost in his steady hands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of "anchoring optimism in realism" emerges through concrete actions—grafting hardy species, teaching interns to "hear the leaves sweating," and learning to build spaces where "storms could enter without wrecking." The lighthouse keeper's absence parallels Rafi's presence, and the final image of him waking "with work ready to meet him" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent free indirect style with selective perception ("the ocean said nothing false") and trauma-inflected imagery ("skein of air snarling"). Dialogue between Rafi and the niece feels natural with appropriate indirection, though some passages drift toward elevated register that slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("a pearl of stillness, weightless and strong") but suffers from occasional template cadence and filter-verb clusters in emotional beats. Information density varies, with some paragraphs doing multiple jobs while others loop through similar emotional territory without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of PTSD recovery through horticultural patience offers a non-obvious angle, with somatic markers integrated as lived technique rather than clinical exposition. The parallel between the automated lighthouse and human resilience, plus the risk of extended lyric reflection that pays off in the closure image, demonstrates thoughtful originality.</comment>
