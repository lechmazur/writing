<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The scattered memory keeper's internal fragmentation ("my pieces refuse any other") creates genuine contradiction between community-mending role and personal incompleteness, with the final gathering of selves ("like swallows, circling, then nesting") earning closure through prior work. Embodied emotion appears in "courage fluttered like burlap" and the tactile swaddling sequences, though some passages drift toward abstraction ("bound release" philosophy).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the piece builds through layered actions (gathering lullabies, threading voices, weaving dawn) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "we rekindle a dying realm by letting it swaddle itself in what it feared to lose," with visible cost in shared scars and surrendered grip. The orientation anchors who/where/when adequately ("alchemical orchard greenhouse," "mirror world"), and the closure image of mutual drinking creates reciprocal transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mica window functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (becoming the loom for weaving dawn) and charges the final covenant image. Sensory detail layers effectively ("soft clink of bottles," "taste of iron on memory," "waxy laughter still sticky"), with the greenhouse environment actively shaping tactics through its distilled regrets and braided sap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake of rekindling the dying realm escalates through accumulation: from gathering lullabies to threading communities' voices to the final mutual weaving across mirror worlds, with cost visible in "debts I have not yet paid" becoming shared scars. Pressure coheres under the textural lens as density increases toward the climactic loom-weaving, though the resolution's philosophical framing ("bound release") slightly abstracts the felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central paradox of mending others while remaining scattered, culminating in "we rekindle a dying realm by letting it swaddle itself in what it feared to lose" - a non-literal answer that reweights the opening fragmentation. The recurring swaddle/release motif accumulates meaning from grafts to realm to final mutual holding, though occasional abstract philosophizing ("bound release again") threatens immediacy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct texture through inventive compounds ("alchemical orchard," "memory keeper") and controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity, particularly in the weaving sequence. The perceptual signature shows in selective noticing (mica's flaws becoming loom hooks), though some passages lean toward elevated register that strains against the intimate POV ("persuasive" light, "negotiating new boundaries").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density remains high with lines doing multiple jobs ("trees distilled regrets into fruit, and shadows braided their sap"), but template cadence appears in repeated "I [verb]" constructions and abstract philosophical insertions ("bound release" appears twice). The prose achieves moments of crystalline specificity ("waxy laughter still sticky") but occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("embarassed by its own thinning light") that creates register friction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The mirror-world twin who shares scars and weaves from the other side offers a fresh angle on self-integration, with the mica window's transformation into loom showing inventive use of constraint. The synthesis of community-mending through literal thread-weaving from voices feels earned, though the "bound release" philosophy edges toward abstraction rather than lived specificity.</comment>
