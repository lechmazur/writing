<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gravestone carver's interiority is richly embodied through specific actions (testing names with ribbon, carving depths that match the father's steadying hand) and contradictory impulses (fierce meditation vs. loosening grip on certainty). The father's grief is particularly well-rendered through his choice of location by lettuce beds and selection of his daughter's kite poem. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("collective grief," "spectral mentorship") that occasionally replaces embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the daughter's stone completion with "kite in a single spare curve" crystallizes the season's work and migration pattern. Cost is visible through the father's returning visits, shared offerings, and the narrator's sustained practice of bearing names. The piece teaches its pattern early (ribbon notches, family poetry custom) and pays it off through accumulating details that reweight grief as "steadied returning."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as active setting that constrains and enables choices—condensation creating "small planets," cracked roof admitting butterflies that mark syllables to soften, broken vents delivering mother's lessons. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (thundering calm, glass ribs singing, dirt path glowing). The greenhouse's capacity to hold both grief and growth while protecting seedlings during storms directly shapes the narrator's carving practice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation operates through accumulative deepening—from testing the seafarer's name to the father's repeated visits, building toward the final kite curve. The dominant stake (discovering grief's shape without breaking it) tightens through specific constraints: butterflies marking syllables, mother's spectral guidance steering from ornament, the storm testing but not breaking the greenhouse. Cost is legible in the father's progression from steadying on lettuce beds to sharing his daughter's notebook.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through concrete particulars—butterflies as "commas trembling with authority of mercy," grief migrating in "widening rings" like the butterfly migration itself. The final insight that movement is "not progress, but steadied returning" reweights all prior material without stating a moral. The kite image transforms from falling (daughter's poem) to a "single spare curve" in stone, offering resonant non-literal answer to how grief finds form.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—the carver notices through craft lens (stones "sounding like waves," greenhouse accepting taps as "measured tide"). Voice modulates effectively between meditative observation and precise technical attention. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("spectral mentorship sharper than any chisel") that slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon, though the overall texture remains consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (butterflies as migration marker, craft guide, and maternal presence). Rhythm varies naturally between longer meditative passages and shorter declarative moments of action. Some abstract phrasing ("collective grief," "thundering calm") occasionally dulls immediacy, and there's minor repetition of "spectral mentorship" concept, but prose remains clear and propulsive through the closure sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exceptional synthesis of gravestone carving with greenhouse setting creates non-obvious meditation on grief's cultivation. The ribbon-as-poem-measure tool and butterflies-as-punctuation are genuinely fresh. Risk-taking in the spectral mother element and the extended metaphor of grief-as-migration heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The specific detail of the father choosing lettuce beds "because the smell steadied him" exemplifies the story's commitment to particular over generic.</comment>
