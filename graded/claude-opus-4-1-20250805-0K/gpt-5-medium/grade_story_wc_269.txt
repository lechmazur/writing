<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to solve the vanishing paths is clear and drives discovery through patient observation and rhythmic practice. The transformation from isolated keeper to community guide is earned through specific actions (tapping, assembling data, recognizing patterns). Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("everything felt drifting moored") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure where the tapping rhythm accumulates meaning until it reveals the corridor's pattern, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration when the community assembles to follow the breathing path. The cost is visible: daily lantern resetting, acceptance of impermanence ("nothing assembled stays assembled if it cannot move"). Orientation anchors clearly by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The monitoring station and its instruments constrain every choice, from the "Assemble" key revealing patterns to the metal bench where evidence is laid out. The shifting sand corridor functions as dynamic setting that shapes the entire resolution. Sensory details ("plankton like hinges in the dark," "wet shiver-sand") are selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (discovering why paths vanish) escalates through accumulating evidence until the tapping pattern reveals the corridor's schedule, forcing a community response. The deepening from personal investigation to collective action shows clear cost: accepting impermanence and adapting to nature's rhythm rather than forcing fixed paths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "drifting moored"—things held in place but shifting within boundaries. The final insight that "nothing assembled stays assembled if it cannot move" reweights all prior material without stating a moral. The coral bleaching parallel to path dissolution creates layered meaning about adaptation and loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and compression ("Everything felt drifting moored," "a coastline of paper islands"). The perceptual signature of counting and tapping creates character-specific noticing. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("periodically eternal," "delayed revelation") that slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The ribbon pulsed with a rhythm that felt periodically eternal, a beating archive older than my breath"). Some figurative density in places ("kelp," "vertebrae," "gatehinged") but serves the accumulative pattern. Minor repetition of "assembled/assemble" but it's pattern-taught and purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of environmental monitoring, coral bleaching, and rhythmic communication is highly original—the station learning through tapping patterns is unexpected yet inevitable. The solution of marking time rather than place transforms the familiar lost-path trope. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and metaphorical density heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
