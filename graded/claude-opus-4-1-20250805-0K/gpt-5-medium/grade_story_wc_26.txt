I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens - the story builds through layered imagery and metaphorical density toward Mira's sacrifice and the library's acceptance, with the final image of her name "inked into the sky between clouds" serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation crystallizes through her sacrifice of stored dreams, with contradictory impulses (preserve balance vs. help Ilen) acting simultaneously in scene. The cost is embodied when she finds "the empty casing where her dreams had been, shaped like the rooms she might have built." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "luminous regret" that approaches therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mira trades her unlived life for Ilen's wholeness, with the library accepting this bargain and inscribing her name in the sky. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building texture toward this exchange. Cost is unmistakable in "the half-lit room where she had stored the life she did not live."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blooming library functions as both setting and agent - vines that "tightened around the aisle," shelves that "sighed open," and the library that "accepted the bargain." The river stone crucially anchors the shadow, constraining choice. Setting directly shapes the resolution through the library's jealous grip and eventual acceptance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from initial search through reels, to the library's resistance ("vines tightened"), to Mira's sacrifice of her stored dreams. The dominant stake - preserving hope's shape - faces clear cost when Mira must trade her own unlived possibilities. One meaningful deepening that reweights the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of borrowed/stored dreams and the price of preserving hope for others. The final image of Mira's name "inked into the sky between clouds" offers a non-literal answer about sacrifice and belonging. Strong integration of the shadow-separation as metaphor for disconnection from self.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature with phrases like "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" and "testimony that patience can sculpt gentler futures." Some register elevation in places ("metamorphose," "luminous regret") that occasionally strains the voice. Dialogue minimal but functional when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("vines of letters climbed the rafters"). Some overwriting in figurative density - nearly every sentence contains metaphor or elevated diction. Template cadence appears in "She walked... She carried... She poured..." sequence. Information density high but occasionally opaque ("the shadow wrote looping questions on the floor").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-living-entity with dream storage/sharing premise. The shadow-separation concept offers genuine novelty, transformed through specific world-building. Risk-taking in the dense metaphorical approach mostly succeeds, though occasionally tips toward overwrought.</comment>
