I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece. The narrative builds through layered imagery and metaphorical resonance rather than causal plot mechanics. The transformation occurs through accumulated revelations about buttons, echoes, and time rather than because/therefore linkages.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hourglass turner's motivation crystallizes through concrete actions—stealing the jar, cataloging buttons, matching echoes to materials. Internal contradiction between duty and rebellion manifests physically in the work itself. The transformation from keeper to offerer is earned through accumulated choices, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("shared wisdom returned to circulation").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the warehouse transforms from prison to "road" with clear cost—the prophecy becoming "clay, quick between the fingers of everyone." The accumulative lens holds as density builds through button-cataloging to communal liberation. Orientation anchors solidly (hourglass turner, amber warehouse, cliff setting). The transformation from counting to offering lands with felt communal cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber warehouse and cliff setting actively constrain choices—echoes "fall into us like fruit," buttons carry weathering and panic. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("ribs of dust and glass," "jar sweats with breath of distance"). The environment transforms from container to open conduit, directly shaping the final liberation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal rebellion (stealing the jar) through methodical resistance (cataloging buttons) to communal transformation (opening the warehouse). The dominant stake—transforming prophecy from lock to key—deepens through accumulated discoveries. Cost is visible as villagers receive their dead's voices and "decide their own next seconds."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of time as both prison and possibility. The button catalog becomes a profound meditation on "decisions that slipped," avoiding abstraction through material specificity (tin/bone/shell). The final image of prophecy as clay rather than stone offers a resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional voice control with distinctive perceptual signature—"My hands smell of sand, resin, and the slow patience." Lyric compression serves the accumulative design ("a hush leans back"). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity, maintaining coherence through metaphorical density without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("the truth unravels in the faintest tremor of the shelves"). Rhythm varies naturally between longer meditative passages and shorter declarative moments. Some metaphorical density in peak beats ("braided memory of many throats") risks opacity but maintains overall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of time-keeping, archaeology, and liberation narrative. The button-cataloging method is genuinely inventive—matching materials to echo frequencies. Risk-taking in the lyric form and metaphorical density heightens stakes while maintaining clarity. The transformation of prophecy from text to textile ("never a line; it is a loom") is fresh and earned.</comment>
