<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's internal conflict between professional duty and personal history creates genuine tension, particularly in the revelation "My first client had been myself." The character's embodied actions (kneeling on stone, feeling grit on knees) ground the emotional state. However, the epiphany about their own past chalk marks feels slightly convenient, and emotional progression could be more contradictory under the pressure of this discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the narrator holds the letter at the mail slot, recognizing their own transformation through helping others transform. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details (chalk codes, arcade echoes, naming practices) build toward this crystallized moment where past and present converge. Cost is felt through "heart loud as sorting machinery" and the weight of "the last lesson is patience," though the final withholding gesture could land with more visceral consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The golden arcade functions as both setting and metaphor, with sensory details like "vaults hold a hush like stacked envelopes" and "grit cling to my knees" creating lived-in specificity. The environment constrains choice through surveillance concerns ("nobody patches camera filters for rainbows close to the ground"). The busker's violin that "warms the stones" triggers the naming revelation, making setting essential to the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on the narrator's ability to create protective identities, with pressure building through the decoding sequence and recognition of their own past marks. The dominant stake—helping someone "open their door again without looking over their shoulder"—tightens when the narrator discovers their own apprentice trail. However, the withholding at the end doesn't fully foreclose options or extract visible cost beyond hesitation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the layered metaphor of naming as protection and transformation, with "Names are the gates and grooves where the city still hears" establishing the conceptual framework. The surface mail's slowness preserving meaning ("speed kills certain meanings the same way glare erases chalk") creates thematic depth. The final image of holding back delivery while "the margin still speaks" resonates without explicit moralizing, though the self-discovery feels slightly orchestrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive texture through phrases like "futuristic nostalgia that touches metal and bone" and specialized vocabulary ("Auricle," "etymologies"). The perceptual signature—noticing chalk codes, architectural details, and sound vibrations—remains consistent and character-specific. Psychic distance modulates effectively from external observation to internal revelation, though some passages edge toward purple prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The vaults hold a hush like stacked envelopes, a tone of futuristic nostalgia"). Some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("heart loud as sorting machinery") works but approaches overwriting. Minor template cadence appears in "I+verb" constructions mid-story. The withholding of the final action creates effective propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of a pseudonym creator using chalk codes for dead-drop communication offers fresh specificity. The integration of surface mail as both practical method and thematic vehicle shows originality. The self-referential discovery adds complexity, though the convenience of finding one's own past marks prevents higher scoring.</comment>
