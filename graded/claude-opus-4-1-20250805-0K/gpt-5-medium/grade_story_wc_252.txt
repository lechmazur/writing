I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric's rigorous standards.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal journey from "hardshell" to self-naming shows genuine earned transformation, with contradictory impulses (hiding grace vs. wanting to be seen) acting simultaneously throughout. The final choice to embrace visibility carries real cost—abandoning protective anonymity. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("combative tenderness") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist's self-naming stabilizes the island and transforms their relationship to community, with visible cost of surrendering protective identity. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until line 3 to fully anchor the protagonist's role.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The disappearing island functions as both literal setting and constraint on choice—its ephemeral nature requires the protagonist's truth-telling to stabilize. Vivid sensory work ("fog into a staircase," "barnacles testifying to a hull"). The sublittoral fringe and maritime details feel lived-in and shape tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear escalation from finding the scrimshaw through the whale's call to public self-declaration, with each beat raising stakes and foreclosing retreat. The dominant stake—authentic self-expression versus protective hiding—tightens through accumulating pressure. Cost is legible in surrendering the safety of "hardshell" identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of mooring lines as meanings and the island's requirement for truth. The final image of "detaching without abandoning" offers a resonant answer to the story's central question about violence, restraint, and authentic connection. No explicit moralizing; complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled compression and purposeful elision that serves the accumulative structure. Strong perceptual signature in maritime metaphors ("grace is what I hide in my muscles"). The prose rhythm intensifies appropriately during the crossing sequence. Minor moments of elevated diction slightly exceed the dock worker's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and good momentum, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("combative tenderness," "patient violence") that could be more concrete. Some metaphor density in high-pressure beats without full payoff. The "violence becomes impossible" worldbuilding could use clearer grounding. No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-violence world with maritime setting creates original premise. The concept of violence becoming impossible leading to new forms of struggle ("desire must fight softly") offers genuine novelty. The pirate's transformation from cutting throats to carving hearts shows inventive reframing of familiar elements.</comment>
