<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The knight's internal journey from withdrawn warrior to someone who chooses "mornings that require tending" over battle is earned through concrete details like his mother's theater program and the visceral unsnapping of armor. The contradictory impulses between his training for "charge and clash" and his soft movement in the orchard create genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "the shape of possibility" that lacks full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation through theater metaphors, alchemical imagery, and the final kernel choice that crystallizes into "possibility settle into him like a homecoming." The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration where he chooses one future and releases others, with visible cost in abandoning his armor and warrior identity. Slight weakness in the middle where causality loosens around how exactly the orchard "answers" him.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard functions as both setting and constraint, with "crucibles hung like lantern fruit" and "equations spliced into bark" creating a vivid hybrid space. The glass ceiling's transformation into "a reel of possible mornings" that drips nectar directly shapes his final choice. The kernel as "a crystal within a fruit shaped like a clenched hand" provides the specific, irreplaceable object that enables closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of choosing one possibility while releasing others is signaled early and tightens through his progression from following stage directions to climbing the ladder to pressing the kernel to his tongue. The cost is legible in his abandonment of armor and warrior oaths. However, the middle section lacks a clear reversal or complication that would heighten pressure before the final choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theater/performance metaphor threads throughout, from the marionette program to "proscenium" branches to the final "theater bells," creating resonance between his mother's art and his transformation. The theme of scripted versus chosen paths emerges organically through concrete details. The ending offers a non-literal answer about choosing possibility over predetermined warrior paths, though some passages drift toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism like "constellations that had learned to root" and "equations were spliced into bark." The perceptual signature shows a knight seeing the world through both military training and emerging artistic awareness. Some register drift occurs with phrases like "statistics of miracles" that feel outside the established lexicon, and occasional filter constructions dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong imagery and rhythm in passages like "He unsnapped the buckle of his visor, letting the cold night lay a palm on his face." However, abstract phrases like "the shape of possibility" and "statistics of miracles" create opacity, and some sentences loop concepts without advancing ("reality shifts" appears twice without clear differentiation). The prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity but inconsistently.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of knight/warrior with alchemical garden and puppet theater creates an unexpected, specific world. The transformation of military hardware into artistic possibility through his mother's theatrical legacy offers genuine freshness. The image of armor "abandoned to rust into reeds" and choosing "mornings that require tending" over battle provides non-obvious emotional truth about transformation.</comment>
