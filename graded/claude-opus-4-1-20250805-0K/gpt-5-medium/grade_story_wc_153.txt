<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal conflict between fleeing and staying crystallizes through embodied details like the scarred palm that "heals in moonlight and reopens at dawn." The final renunciation of deciding ("I will go home and not decide, not yet") is earned through the protagonist's journey to understand their earlier failure, with visible emotional cost in lines like "fierce tenderness cracking my ribs like kindling trying to become fire."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through lyric recursion until the Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: "I will share the hinge and let it breathe us." The cost is legible in the protagonist's recognition of "that tenderness hoarded" and commitment to vulnerability. The orientation anchors (mangrove labyrinth, spirits, Mara) establish clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth functions as more than setting—it constrains navigation ("I do not steer by stars here, but by those wet letters") and enables revelation through the spirits' songs and lantern messages. The gargoyle shard serves as micro-setting, its physical properties (cutting edge, pendant weight) shaping choices and marking time through the wound cycle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering the moment before a relationship-breaking decision—intensifies through accumulation: from seeking to witnessing to speaking the unsent letters. The protagonist's agency manifests in choosing vulnerability over armor ("let silence not be armor"), with cost visible in accepting shame and practicing stillness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete image of the "hinge of breath where a door could wait"—the pause before irreversible choice. The final line "let it breathe us" offers a non-literal answer to the central question about timing and tenderness, reweighting the entire journey without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistency through water-based perception ("I pole the skiff," "blackwater mirror") and musical language ("choruses ache me awake"). The cryptic medium's "answers arrive sideways and hum" establishes a perceptual signature maintained throughout, with purposeful compression serving the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The moon lifts, and my wound closes by degrees, a small white door learning how to stay open"). However, abstract phrasing occasionally dulls immediacy ("the space where an apology waits unspoken") and some metaphorical vehicles strain coherence ("fierce tenderness cracking my ribs like kindling").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of mystical journey and relationship repair through the specific lens of a "cryptic medium" whose answers "arrive sideways" feels fresh. The transformation of the gargoyle shard from cathedral memory to healing timekeeper to practiced stillness shows genuine ingenuity in handling familiar material.</comment>
