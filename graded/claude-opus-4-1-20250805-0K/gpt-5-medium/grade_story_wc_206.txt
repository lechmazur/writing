<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to reclaim stolen light is grounded in a visceral physical reaction to dishonesty ("my bones softening like wax"), creating embodied stakes that drive choices. The shadow-trading decision carries genuine cost, though some interiority relies on abstraction ("the delicate art of listening for hairline hurts"). Internal contradiction manifests beautifully when confessing the sold lullaby steadies rather than weakens the narrator.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure: the narrator trades their shadow to restore light, establishing a new covenant of listening rather than ownership. The cost is visceral—the shadow steps away "like a careful apprentice"—and the final image of shared vigilance ("Together we keep the city singing") resonates with earned transformation. Causality holds as each confession and truth-telling builds toward the binding agreement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The resonance chamber constrains choices through its demand for "honesty and offering," while specific details like "ribs of brass catching lunar flecks" and "names carved into the floor" create atmospheric pressure. The chip from philosopher's stone functions as micro-setting that enables the resolution. However, the broader city remains somewhat abstract beyond its dimness and copper veins.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (wilting near dishonesty) to communal (city's stolen light) with the shadow-trading cost making the price concrete. The rust's negotiation creates genuine pressure, forcing the narrator to offer both confession and permanent service. The tethering of light to listening rather than ownership represents a meaningful deepening that reweights the entire conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between ownership and stewardship, with the final covenant requiring perpetual attention rather than possession. The confession about selling another's grief adds moral complexity without resolution. The ending's image of collaborative maintenance ("Together we keep the city singing") offers a non-literal answer about communal responsibility that reweights earlier material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines technical precision ("gantries and rails," "ward") with lyrical compression ("my knuckles to rain"). The perceptual signature shows in unique formulations like "mending what isn't torn" and "springs that hold grudges." Rhythm modulates effectively under pressure, though occasional abstractions ("tinkersong wonder") slightly dilute the otherwise concrete diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The city has been dim for three rotations, all our mornings bruised"). Some figurative language borders on over-density ("ribs of brass catching lunar flecks") but serves the accumulative texture. Minor template cadence in middle sections ("I told them... They listened...") slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of trading one's shadow for communal light offers fresh inflection on sacrifice narratives, particularly through the mechanism of tethering light to listening. The specific synthesis of music box repair with civic restoration feels inevitable in hindsight. The covenant transformation from rust/hush to attention/repair represents meaningful subversion of typical redemption arcs.</comment>
