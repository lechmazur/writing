<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sera's motivation to restore the harbor through ritual action is clear and embodied through concrete actions like sewing the tether and reading the labyrinth with fingertips. The character shows genuine struggle between precedent and innovation, though some emotional transitions ("hauntingly optimistic") lean on labels rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to leave the plate and carry home the tether demonstrates earned renunciation with visible communal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through ritual actions and sensory accretion toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where water returns to the harbor. The closure lands with visible cost—Sera leaves the plate behind, transforming from taking to tending. Causality occasionally softens into mystical convenience (hidden sluices opening), but the pattern-teaching of sleepwalking paths and the tether's accumulating names maintains coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The red canyon labyrinth functions as both setting and constraint, with its "teeth" and "throat" shaping Sera's navigation choices. Sensory details like "rust and thyme" and "sunbaked kelp" create atmospheric density while the plate's interaction with mirror water demonstrates setting-as-agent. The tide pools' emptying creates temporal pressure that initiates action, and the labyrinth's physical features (socket shaped like a beak, stone altar) directly enable the ritual transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the harbor from "ruin to reverence"—is established early and tested through Sera's navigation of the labyrinth. Escalation occurs through accumulating ritual actions (tying knots, sewing names, pressing plate into socket) that each narrow options, though the final resolution relies on mystical convenience rather than earned struggle. The cost is visible in leaving the plate behind and transforming the community's relationship with the tide pools.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between "broken precedents" and new ceremony, with the plate's forbidden status embodying resistance to change. The final shift from taking to tending offers a non-literal answer to the opening desolation. However, the resolution tilts toward convenient harmony ("small, continual yeses") without fully exploring the complexity of communal transformation or acknowledging those who might resist change.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sera's poetic voice maintains consistency through maritime metaphors ("hands learned meter from rope and salt") and compressed, lyrical syntax. The perceptual signature—focusing on textures, tethers, and tidal rhythms—remains distinct throughout. Minor register drift occurs in abstract moments ("orchid solace, quiet and luminous") that momentarily abandon the tactile specificity, though the voice recovers for the closing image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic variation and information density, with lines like "The harbor has thinned to ribs" doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting appears in peak moments ("orchid solace, quiet and luminous as dusk tide returning") where figurative language accumulates without clear vehicle. Template cadence occasionally emerges ("I tell them... I leave the plate... I am still") but doesn't pervade enough to seriously damage momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of maritime labor with mystical ritual offers a fresh angle on community restoration narratives. The specific detail of overlapping sleepwalking paths as navigation method shows genuine invention. However, the resolution's convenient mysticism (hidden sluices opening, harbor bell ringing itself) retreats from the bold specificity of the setup, settling for magical rather than earned transformation.</comment>
