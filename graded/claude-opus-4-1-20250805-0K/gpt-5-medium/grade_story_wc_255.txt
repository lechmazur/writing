<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ivo's colorblindness driving his sensory substitutions ("reads the furnace smoke by flavor and the cobbles by temperature") creates specific, embodied characterization. His "innocently cunning" nature manifests through honest aim at "the thing he cannot see," and his final choice to stay and "paint the glass while it cools" shows earned transformation with visible cost (trading his best brush and smoke jar). Minor deduction for the slightly abstract resolution of how beauty becomes "a rhythm" rather than more concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the plant-language system building density toward Ivo's awakening that "beauty in imperfection is a rhythm." The reed tongue transforms his perception from seeking color names to understanding "edges of things breathe and the spaces between them sing," creating a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (his best brush and jarred smoke). The phoenix-as-cycle frames both opening and closing, creating coherent pressure through the market of "bartered awakenings."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glassblower's courtyard with its furnaces, cooling shelves, and plant arrangements on sills creates a tactile, lived-in workspace that enables the central exchange system. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("smoke by flavor," "cobbles by temperature"). The reed tongue as micro-setting object constrains Ivo's choice and transforms his artistic practice, though some middle passages lean toward abstract description rather than concrete spatial choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding beauty in imperfection despite colorblindness—escalates through the barter system requiring real sacrifice (best brush, jarred smoke). The reed's awakening deepens rather than reverses, transforming Ivo's understanding from seeking color to hearing "rhythm" in broken light. Cost is visible in the trade and felt in his commitment to stay, though middle sections could tighten the pressure between desire and price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plant-language system elegantly embodies the theme of finding alternate paths to beauty and communication. The final insight that "color is just one oath among many, and breakable" emerges from Ivo's specific experience with the reed, not abstract philosophizing. The ending image of the courtyard holding "enough awakenings for everyone willing to barter softness for sight" resonantly reweights the opening's post-phoenix quiet.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout: Ivo experiencing the world through temperature, flavor, and plant arrangements creates a unique sensory lens. The lyric voice maintains consistency through lists and repetitions that feel pattern-taught ("rosemary near the door means brave entry, fennel by the furnace means patience"). No dialogue preserves the meditative tone while the plant exchanges create action through arrangement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in the plant-language passages. However, several abstract formulations weaken precision: "beauty in imperfection is a rhythm," "listen open," "the world chooses its own edges." Some repetitive sentence openings ("He + verb" pattern) in middle sections. The prose achieves lyric coherence but occasionally sacrifices concrete clarity for elevated register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plant-language barter system is genuinely fresh—a non-verbal communication method that serves both worldbuilding and theme. Ivo's colorblind painting finding beauty through temperature and rhythm transforms the expected artist narrative. The "market of bartered awakenings" where "losses are traded for small instruments of change" creates an original economy of transformation that feels inevitable within this post-phoenix world.</comment>
