<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal journey from rigid control to permeable acceptance is earned through concrete interaction with the farm's systems, with her grief over Kian providing genuine emotional stakes. The micro-choices (not rushing to fix the steam leak, holding the cat's pattern as "guest") reveal her evolving stance toward letting go with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through Mara's interactions with the farm until the final recognition that "what begins as vigilance can become hospitality." The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where she achieves self-knowledge "neither harder nor softer, simply more true" with the emotional cost of accepting Kian's absence paid throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bioluminescent farm functions as more than setting—its permeable barriers and responsive systems mirror and enable Mara's internal transformation. Sensory details ("blue and green caps pulsed like distant towns," "damp turned herbal") are filtered through her spatial gift, and the environment actively constrains choices (the cat's path, the steam leak requiring a traced solution).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation as Mara tests her theory of "permeable barriers" against both the farm's security needs and her own grief, with each interaction (shelves awakening, cat appearing, steam whistling) adding texture to her central question. The cost is felt in lines like "unhooking a tight dress stitched around the heart," though the pressure could tighten more decisively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of security systems learning "to greet movement without mistaking it for invasion," which reframes both professional detection and personal grief work. The final image of "quiet wildfire...reshaping what it did not need to destroy" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about letting go.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinctive perceptual signature through Mara's spatial gift ("saw perimeters as melodies and gaps as rests") with controlled lyrical compression that serves the accumulative mode. The prose modulates effectively between technical precision and emotional vulnerability, though occasional abstraction ("familiar strangers") could ground more concretely.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Security could work through permeable barriers, like water finding shape without losing itself"). Some abstract phrasing ("familiar strangers," "hosted them long enough") creates minor opacity, and the "quiet wildfire" metaphor in the final line, while resonant, slightly strains coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of intrusion detection expertise with grief processing through "permeable barriers" offers a fresh, non-obvious angle that feels inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its premise of security-as-hospitality, following implications through concrete farm interactions rather than abstract philosophizing.</comment>
