I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through lyric density and pattern recognition toward a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist chooses to create a glass window that will expose truth through frost patterns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation crystallizes through concrete details—surviving the furnace attempt, discovering the ledger, recognizing the rival's laugh. Internal conflict plays out through the glass artist's choice between destroying evidence, reporting it, or creating an "annealed" solution. The final decision to fuse the ledger in glass demonstrates earned agency with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from survival through discovery to resolution, with the ledger strip serving as the causal thread. The closure—choosing to create a window that frost will read—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost: the protagonist must return to face potential danger. The "steadily adaptive answer" pays off the established pattern of glass, frost, and testimony.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The canyon setting actively participates—it "listens," "carries rhythm," and will serve as the witness space. Frost patterns on stone become the discovery mechanism, while the furnace-as-tomb attempt grounds the stakes. The interplay of glass, frost, fire, and stone creates a coherent sensory world that constrains choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from physical survival (past attempt) through discovery (ledger's meaning) to moral choice (how to expose truth). The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through the specific choice of glass-as-witness. Cost is visible: returning to danger, crafting the window, trusting the canyon's testimony over conventional justice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of transparency and opacity, fire and frost, testimony and silence. The concept of "purpose in pauses" manifests concretely through gaps in the ledger revealing routes. The final image of glass letting "purpose pour through emptiness" offers a non-literal answer about truth-telling through craft rather than confrontation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines craft terminology ("annealed," "crown glass") with lyric perception ("stars felt like witnesses"). The perceptual signature—reading patterns in frost, hearing glass sing—remains consistent. Rhythmic control modulates from contemplative opening to decisive ending without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose maintains high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Song nested in stone, then rose, then braided"). Some metaphoric density in middle sections ("tiny drought of soot") occasionally obscures momentum. Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks that track the discovery process.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of glass artistry with criminal investigation through frost-reading creates an original detection method. The "annealed" solution—neither destroying nor directly reporting but creating a testimonial window—offers a fresh moral calculus. The specific intersection of craft knowledge and justice feels earned rather than convenient.</comment>
