<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Iri's motivation to harmonize logic and intuition drives concrete micro-choices (placing the crystal, reading starlings, letting formulas wait) with visible restraint. The grandmother relationship adds emotional specificity without excess backstory. The final choice to seal the reliquary shows earned renunciation with cost ("carrying nothing but balance"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around internal states that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through starling patterns, crystal placement, and sensory layering until the orchard's transformation crystallizes as Resonant Reconfiguration. Cost is visible in Iri's deliberate restraint of formulas and the sealing away of the reliquary. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and pays off with "fruit that grew like thoughts." Slight deduction for cost being more conceptual than visceral at the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The orchard functions as active setting—trees with "bark like maps," roots that "remember childhood," and the waterfall's color shifts all constrain Iri's choices and timing. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (copper matching her hair's secret). The reliquary's placement "beneath a nest of roots where the flame could not reach" shows environment shaping tactics directly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through the starlings' shifting patterns, the crystal's "chime," and Iri's deliberate withholding of formulas until "the hour had ripened." The dominant stake (harmonizing logic/intuition) tightens when she realizes "formulas would ruin the music if recited now." Cost appears in her final renunciation, walking out "carrying nothing but balance."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the frozen dew teaching trees to "hold both frost and blossom," the starlings' patterns as "chaos braided into counsel." The grandmother's wisdom ("logic was a lantern and intuition the path") avoids platitude through its integration with Iri's choices. The ending's "bright compromise" between arithmetic and dream resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled lyricism ("kaleidoscopic waterfall braided every color") and consistent POV filtering. Some elevated diction ("reliquary," "vellum") fits the alchemist perspective. Minor register drift in places like "quietly sentimental" feels slightly detached from the otherwise sensory-rich narration. The perceptual signature of reading patterns and chemical precision is maintained throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The frozen dew crystal chimed faintly, a bell of winter inside summer"). Some repetitive phrasing around "secretly sentimental" and occasional abstract constructions ("the touch of wonder") that could be more concrete. Rhythm varies appropriately with scene needs, accelerating during the starlings' movements and slowing for contemplation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy with natural observation—reading starling patterns as mathematical proofs is non-obvious. The specific detail of copper hair as "tinctured vow" and trees wearing "bark like maps" avoids generic fantasy. The harmonizing of logic/intuition through concrete natural processes (crystal teaching roots, flame and ice coexisting) transforms familiar dualities.</comment>
