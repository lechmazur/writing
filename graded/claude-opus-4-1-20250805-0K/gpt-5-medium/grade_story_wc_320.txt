<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "find the beginning in every ending" drives consistent choices through listening, tuning, and translating signals, with internal conflict between keeping and releasing shown through concrete actions like pressing the hush shard to the mast. The final choice to leave the artifacts and descend shows earned change through prior causality with visible cost (leaving behind the tools that enabled connection).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through pattern accumulation ("stopped naming...stopped fearing") toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the city learns to "keep time with what it let go," with visible cost in the grandmother's instruction to "listen without keeping." The closure lands with the engineer's note crystallizing the narrator's role, though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually implied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The setting actively constrains choices through the suspended tower configuration, broken ladders, and gorge positioning, with the mast becoming a stylus and the gorge a record player in the climactic transformation. Sensory details like "winds braided old advertisements into prayers" and "serenely electric register that prickled my gums" filter through the narrator's signal-interpreter perspective, directly enabling the final resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating pressure as signals rise from the gorge, each carrying specific requests that force the narrator to navigate between keeping and releasing, with the lunar perigee creating temporal urgency. The dominant stake of finding beginnings in endings tightens when the narrator must thread the star fragment onto the lightning scar, though the resolution relies somewhat on the city's cooperation rather than pure protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete interplay of endings and beginnings, with the hush shard clarifying rather than deadening echoes and the final engineer's note ("Begin last, end first") offering a resonant non-literal answer. The recurring motif of signals, broadcasts, and recordings accumulates meaning through specific transformations, particularly when "endings busy with beginnings" reweights all prior disconnections.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shows through specialized vocabulary ("celestial signal interpreter," "voltmeters like a choir") and selective attention to technical/mystical details, with controlled modulation as emotional intensity rises. The lyric compression and metaphorical density ("moon lowered the needle of gravity") serves the fantastical premise, though occasional elevation ("serenely electric lull") slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The mast became a stylus, and the gorge became a record, and the moon lowered the needle of gravity"), though some figurative density in peak beats approaches overwriting. Minor template cadence appears in "I stopped naming...I stopped fearing" sequence but serves intentional pattern-teaching that pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of abandoned infrastructure as a living archive of farewells, with the specific twist that the city "dies at dawn and wakes at dusk," transforms the familiar ghost-town trope through concrete mechanical details. The risk of blending technical radio terminology with mystical elements ("shard of hush") heightens stakes while maintaining coherence, and the final revelation that the narrator's job was always to "carry both as equal weights" feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
