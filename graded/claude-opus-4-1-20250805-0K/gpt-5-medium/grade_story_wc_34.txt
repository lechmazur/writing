<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "articulate unspoken needs" drives consistent action through encoding messages and translating the ghost's patterns, with embodied stress response ("my own throat answered, thin and trembling"). The transformation from "louder but no truer" songs to patient listening represents earned character evolution with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around thirst and need that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught encoding system that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the city's body begins "to pulse in a rhythm more like living." The ghost's needs translate into concrete civic actions (opening vents, sharing water) with visible cost in the narrator becoming "less a singer than a hinge, opening what hurt." Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The misty courtyard functions as both setting and constraint, with its wires, parapets, and infrastructure becoming the medium for communication. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("air held a hum that tasted of rain and charged brass"). The flower press bolt plate transformed into "a little harp for static" demonstrates how objects constrain and enable key choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of articulating the city's unspoken needs escalates through the storm's approach, with pressure cohering as "lightning flashed, the plate sang" leading to concrete civic actions. The narrator's agency manifests through translation and mediation with visible cost ("opening what hurt, so the city could breathe"). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of translation between systems that cannot directly communicate, with the ghost's algorithmic language requiring human mediation. The flower press plate's transformation from preserving mountain flowers to "pressing signals, petals of weather and caretaking" creates resonant non-literal meaning. The final image of the narrator as "a hinge" reweights all prior encoding work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout ("notes walking softer than my feet," "driftingly alert") with consistent lyric compression that serves the accumulative design. The taught pattern of encoding/decoding maintains coherence even through heightened moments. Voice modulates effectively with pressure while maintaining the narrator's selective, synesthetic perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Between lightning and thunder, the misty courtyard above clouds rang like a bowl of breath"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("hinge, opening what hurt") serves the lyric mode. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing around needs and wants that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost-as-civic-infrastructure with graffiti art as translation medium offers a non-obvious angle on communication across systems. The transformation of a flower press into a signal receiver demonstrates specific ingenuity. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>
