<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's prosopagnosia creates a compelling lens of methodical observation over recognition, with internal contradictions between the need to understand faces and the inability to read them. The final revelation about the woman who "brought Mara to the edge" lands with earned ambiguity, though the emotional cost could be more visceral at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the final painting that reweights the evidence—the blue ribbon fragment reveals not Mara's presence but her absence/exchange. The cost manifests conceptually in the letter-writer's confession of bringing Mara "to the edge," though the exact nature of harm remains purposefully elided. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer toward meaning rather than causal resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The quarry's mist and stone create atmospheric pressure, with the rebar lance serving as a tool that constrains investigation method. Sensory details like "gas, but grief also rises when pierced, slow and sulfurous" effectively filter through the narrator's particular perception, though the setting could more actively shape the final revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering what happened to Mara through physical evidence rather than faces—deepens as each found object (ribbon, phone case, perfume) accumulates wrong details that force reinterpretation. The pressure tightens when the blue ribbon contradicts the file's red fox mask, though the final cost remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of "unifying opposites" emerges organically through the investigation method and Mara's shelter work, culminating in the painting that stages "harm into help" as one image. The final letter suggesting "fear met gentleness there, and both stepped back" offers a resonant non-literal answer about empathy's limits and possibilities.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice maintains a distinctive contemplative register with lines like "I draw the way riverbeds remember water" that capture the narrator's unique perceptual stance. The prose modulates effectively between investigation and reflection, though occasional elevated diction ("sulfurous," "prosopagnosia") slightly strains the intimate tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Lance the silt, the deputy had said, and see what bubbles"). Some mild repetition around the "unifying opposites" concept and occasional register elevation ("a bowl of breath held by stone") that doesn't quite match the investigative frame, but overall momentum remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prosopagnosic detective investigating through objects rather than faces offers a fresh angle on the cold case genre. The specific synthesis of face-blindness with portrait artistry creates an inevitable-feeling paradox, though the masquerade setting edges toward familiar territory.</comment>
