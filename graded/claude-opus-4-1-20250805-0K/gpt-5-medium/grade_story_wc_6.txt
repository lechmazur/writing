<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to prove "scars can sing" drives concrete choices—teaching the boy to graft hope onto old wood while managing her inherited fire-reading skills toward "unyielding compassion." The boy's presence creates immediate relational pressure that forces her to model healing through action rather than words. Minor deduction for the father's arson backstory feeling slightly convenient, but the protagonist's contradictory inheritance (his skill, not his purpose) creates genuine internal tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and symbolic actions build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where grafting becomes literal and metaphoric healing. The closure lands with visible cost—the boy's burned hand and her daily navigation of triggers ("matches rattling in a drawer"). Deduction for slightly loose causality in the middle section where the lagoon's singing feels ornamental rather than essential to the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon's glass-like surface that can hold songs while the volcanic sand floats "like char that had learned to float after so many drownings of flame" creates a physically specific world where elements constrain choices. The coin's westward swing determines when to approach the water, making environment actively shape tactics. Sensory hierarchy reflects her firefighter's attention to wind, texture, and sound.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving transformation is possible despite inherited trauma—escalates through the boy's arrival with his burned hand, forcing her from private ritual to public teaching. The grafting lesson transforms abstract hope into physical action with visible cost (his scarred hand, her triggered memories). The lagoon's "chorus of tiny breakages" provides textural deepening rather than causal reversal, appropriate for the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of grafting—taking damaged material and making it capable of new growth—which gains power through literal enactment with the olive seedling. The concept of "healed edges" making sound rather than silence offers a non-obvious answer to trauma. The final image of her becoming "the opposite of a fuse, a graceful delay" reweights the arsonist inheritance without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinctive lyric register with controlled metaphoric density ("clouds traveled like herons," "kelp-drift peace") that supports the accumulative mode. POV filters consistently through her firefighter's perceptual signature—reading wind, assessing danger, measuring breath. Some elevated diction ("unyielding compassion," "resonant reconfiguration") occasionally drifts from the established register, and dialogue feels slightly formal for the intimate teaching moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("black sand...like char that had learned to float after so many drownings of flame") with strong rhythmic control. However, several passages contain scaffold phrases and near-repetitions ("she had," "she wanted," "she would" openings) that create template cadence. The abstract phrase "unyielding compassion" appears three times without sufficient variation, and some metaphors stretch thin ("houses like riddles").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of firefighter-as-arsonist's-daughter creates inherent tension, and the obsidian lagoon that sings offers a fresh setting. The grafting metaphor for healing trauma through teaching rather than forgetting shows genuine insight. However, some elements feel writing-workshop familiar (trauma inheritance, healing through metaphoric action), preventing higher scores despite strong execution.</comment>
