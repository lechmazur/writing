I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator's contradictory impulses—holding onto dying seasons while pragmatically saving "for the next workable patch of light"—act powerfully in scene through concrete choices with the rosebush, the lighthouse mission, and the father's tool. The final renunciation (leaving the lighthouse to "cut the beam into slips and root it at home") carries visible emotional cost earned through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator transforms from passive grief to active light-bearing, with felt cost in the mother's countdown and father's memory. The pattern of light/dark imagery accumulates meaningfully toward "protected vulnerability" as both architecture and stance, though the transition from fire escape to harbor could anchor more clearly at ~400 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fire escape garden, harbor, and lighthouse create lived-in specificity that constrains choices—the narrator must row because of geography, must pick locks because of abandonment, must work by moonlight. The brass tooth and lantern mechanics ground abstract themes in tactile reality, though the fish plant's "congregation of eyes" briefly strains coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal grief (mother's countdown, father's memory) through physical risk (rowing at night, breaking in) to communal responsibility (the pointing child). The "quivering hush" effectively builds tension through accumulation rather than reversal, with meaningful deepening when the lit beacon draws the community's response.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ending's image of watering "corners and windowsills and alleys with light" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to grief and inheritance without stating a moral. "Protected vulnerability" emerges organically as both the lantern's architecture and the narrator's discovered stance, reweighting all prior gardening and light-tending imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—"I am a fire escape gardener, which means I have learned to love what clings to iron"—with consistent POV modulation under emotional pressure. The lyric compression serves the accumulative design, particularly in constructions like "the harbor waits like a sleeping lung," though occasional elevation ("shoals on the waves") slightly exceeds the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"I row toward the point with the rhythm of oars in water, steady, counting breaths, matching my pulse to the quiet thunder in the pilings" layers action, emotion, and atmosphere. Minor register drift in "frank relief that feels like forgiveness" and slight redundancy in the lock-picking sequence prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of gardening, locksmithing, and lighthouse-keeping as inherited forms of care-taking feels fresh and inevitable. The specific detail of the "lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth" and treating doors as "gardens in winter" transforms familiar grief narrative through concrete particularity.</comment>
