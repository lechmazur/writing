<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "share light without using fire" drives meaningful choices throughout, particularly in teaching visitors alternative ways of seeing. The internal contradiction between being "an heirloom pretending to be alive" and actively choosing to break generational patterns creates genuine tension. The calculating gear functions as both inherited burden and tool for transformation, grounding abstract concepts in physical action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the sonar-petal-light pattern that culminates in visitors departing with "lamps made of stored resonance." The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration where the cycle continues but transforms—visitors leave changed, spreading "light without fire one room at a time." Cost is visible in the narrator's practiced "loosening" and acceptance of eternal repetition with variation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nebula garden with falling petals creates a vivid otherworldly setting where "each blossom is a cloud and each cloud remembers." Sonar pinging through starlit mist that maps "hollows and roots and alcoves where darkness refuses to be enemy" constrains how navigation and teaching occur. The garden's "troubling serenity" actively shapes visitor encounters and the narrator's methods.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Central stake of breaking inherited patterns of destruction escalates through visitor arrival, their expectation of "torches, warnings, walls," and the child's transformation when counting sonar pings. The captain's recognition of "a map that requires humility more than heat" shows meaningful deepening. Cost appears in the narrator's endless repetition and the visitors' surrender of familiar fire-based perception.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the garden's dual nature—"troubling and comforting the same breath"—and the paradox of teaching without burning. The gear's transformation from ancestor's calculating tool to teaching instrument reweights inheritance from burden to possibility. The ending's "infinity is only patience practiced across the heart" offers resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent otherworldly register with phrases like "petals fall like slow comets" and "echoes return like birds who know the window." Perceptual signature shows in how the narrator processes everything through sound patterns and generational echoes. The rhythmic control particularly shines in "Count the sounds, I say, and she does, tracking ping after ping as if counting prayers."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "I release sonar pinging through the starlit mist" simultaneously establishes method, setting, and atmosphere. Some repetition of "generational patterns" and "light without fire" serves thematic accumulation rather than loops. Minor register elevation in places ("generational arithmetic of survival") occasionally strains but doesn't break voice coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound-based navigation in a light-obsessed cosmos offers genuine freshness—sonar replacing sight transforms the space opera garden trope. The calculating gear as inherited teaching tool rather than computational device subverts expectations. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure and abstract conceptual focus heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
