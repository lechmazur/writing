I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through layered gestures, symbols, and recursive patterns rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "honor overlooked histories" drives consistent micro-choices throughout—arranging ephemeral signals, knotting the moth wing, promising to "stitch their names from moss and echo." The internal contradiction between being an "esoteric realist" suspicious of fantasy yet seeking truth through symbolic gestures creates authentic complexity. The final choice to wait for history's answer demonstrates earned stillness with visible cost (time, vulnerability).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the narrator lying in moss, "eyes open to green light," waiting for history to answer—a Charged Poise that crystallizes the tension between action and receptivity. The accumulative pattern of temporary structures coheres into this final stillness where the narrator becomes another transient signal. Cost is felt through the vulnerability of waiting and the acceptance that these gestures may dissolve "beyond sunset."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto setting actively shapes choices—water's "interrupted cadence" mirrors the thematic pattern, moss provides the final resting surface, and the cave-mouth frames the liminal space between permanence and transience. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "green light," "cooled gust," "drop of water on my lip." The monarch's arrival as "burned syllable of orange" exemplifies how setting elements constrain the narrator's symbolic vocabulary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation rather than reversal—each arranged signal raises the question of whether ephemeral gestures can honor permanent loss. The monarch's arrival tests the method when it "circled my signals, and appeared to bless the method," validating the approach with nature's witness. Cost accumulates through the acceptance that these structures won't last "beyond sunset" yet still matter.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete tension between temporary gestures and permanent memory, avoiding abstraction. The moth wing (night) juxtaposed with monarch (day) creates a non-literal meditation on cycles of loss and witness. The final image of waiting for history to "answer gently through stillness" reweights all prior arranging as both futile and necessary without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive perceptual signature through compound constructions ("transiently rooted but stubborn") and selective attention to ephemeral details. The controlled shift from active arranging to receptive waiting modulates with emotional intensity. Diction stays within an educated naturalist's lexicon without unmotivated register shifts, though occasional abstractions ("municipal forgetfulness forever") slightly dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "I strewed reeds into triangles, balanced pebbles on bark, and traced circles of pollen" simultaneously advances action, reveals character method, and builds atmospheric texture. Some repetitive constructions appear ("transiently rooted" used twice) but serve pattern-teaching. The final line delivers propulsive closure through image rather than explanation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of honoring forgotten keepers through ephemeral natural arrangements offers genuine freshness—avoiding both sentimental memorial and cynical dismissal. The synthesis of "esoteric realist" with physical ritual-making feels specific and earned. The story commits fully to its quiet register without retreating into easier dramatic confrontation.</comment>
