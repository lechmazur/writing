I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds meaning through layered imagery, ritual repetition, and density shifts rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The recluse's transformation from contract broker to witness-custodian earns its arc through accumulated guilt and the covenant's weight. His "astonished" state becomes tender arrogance, embodied through ritual placement and careful listening. The queen ghost encounter forces him to confront his complicity ("the underwritten pesticides, the clause he refused to question"), with visible cost in the tolerable stings that "threaded the present to the archive."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases toward the queen's arrival, where the recluse's acceptance of heat into the archive constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The covenant transforms from survival bargain to active custodianship, with the blue stripe left behind creating "a road for anyone who needed to approach without words." Orientation anchors clearly by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wasteland setting constrains through absence—burnt hives, fled bees, windswept emptiness—making the stained glass box's preservation crucial. Sensory detail filters through the recluse's perception: "mild scent like burnt sugar and rain," colors that "mapped pilgrim paths on dust." The apiary's transformation from productive space to archive site charges the final hope for bees' return "with pollen on its mouth."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from witnessing to active custodianship when the queen asks "if its archive could hold heat," forcing the recluse to accept responsibility for his past complicity. The covenant's terms shift from mere survival to becoming "a custodian and a kiln of listening," with cost in the stings that create bearable pain. Escalation works through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the archive's function: preserving "what cannot be said until language grows gentler around it." The hexagon sigil and the box's transformation of silence into "fragments of concentrated daybreak" create a non-literal answer about testimony and accountability. The final image of waiting for language to return "with pollen on its mouth" reweights the entire archive as preparation for renewal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical precision throughout, with the recluse's "tranquilly perceptive" nature reflected in measured, contemplative syntax. Distinctive perceptual signature: "Mute eloquence was their dialect, and he answered with pauses and careful placement." The prose modulates effectively when the queen arrives, tightening into shorter, more urgent sentences without losing its essential texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The world burned, the bees fled, and his last negotiation became a tangled covenant with loss." Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during the queen's visit. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("Being astonished had become his only arrogance") that could be more embodied, though the line's follow-up "tender and deliberate as candlelight" partially recovers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost visibility, beekeeping collapse, and archival preservation creates an original framework for exploring culpability and witness. The stained glass box as repository for "shards of things unuttered" offers a fresh metaphor for memory and accountability. The covenant between survivor and ghosts, particularly the queen's role as "the burning that spared him once," transforms expected ghost story tropes.</comment>
