<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inspector's internal contradiction between professional duty ("isolate, calculate, fortify") and personal mission ("listen, braid, release") creates genuine tension that drives the decisive choice. The character's specific trait of "acquiring abandoned hopes" manifests concretely through handling the pearl and choosing communion over isolation, with visible cost in defying regulations.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered confessions that reweight the dominant stake of isolation vs. communion. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully when the pearl's placement transforms the bunker from isolation chamber to communion space, with clear cost in the inspector's career pivot ("mistaken safety for solitude and called it a career").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The crystal cave functions as more than setting—its "resonant hush" and quartz formations actively constrain and enable the inspector's choice, particularly the spire that receives the pearl. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("walls of quartz rose like frozen rain"), with the environment directly shaping the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each confession adds weight to the choice between isolation and connection. The hesitation moment ("the moment opened like a small door only sympathy can see") creates a decisive tightening where the inspector must choose, with clear cost in abandoning professional protocol.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the spiral of confessions and the pearl's transformation of the space, never stated directly. The final image of daylight as "a door made of faces, all open, all mending" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of human connection versus survival through isolation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("the cave crown me with stillness") and consistent POV that filters perception through the inspector's unique perspective. The perceptual signature shows in specific phrasings like "carrying a harder assignment inside my ribs," though occasional elevation ("filament of latent radiance") slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with high information density and purposeful rhythm, but some overwriting appears in figurative language ("ghost rivers," "scalloped like a throat"). Minor template cadence in the confession sequence ("A woman confessed... A boy admitted... A scientist whispered") and occasional register elevation detract from otherwise clean execution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of a bunker inspector who actually inspects loneliness offers fresh perspective on familiar post-apocalyptic territory. The specific synthesis of bureaucratic role with spiritual mission, culminating in the pearl's transformation of isolation infrastructure into communion space, feels both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
