I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through lyric accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist discovers "home was not a dwelling but a practice."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to recover lost identity is embodied through concrete details like the feather on the tongue and touching the stone. The final choice to "seed my tongue with my old consonants" shows earned transformation with visible cost—the shame-encyclopedias moved aside. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("remembering becomes painful") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where home transforms from place to practice, with the cost of confronting buried shame made visible. The piece teaches its lyric logic early through "ivy made of pages" and maintains coherent pressure through the seer's substitutions. The closure lands with "I spoke my first true hello, and the mountain answered," showing earned change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bookstore-mountain setting actively shapes the journey through shifting shelves and "dictionaries muttered where no wind reached." Spatial choreography remains coherent as aisles curl into cul-de-sacs, floors slope and lift. The environment constrains choice when "shelves aligned into a corridor shaped like a question mark," directly enabling the final discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through deepening revelations about silenced identity. The stone scene creates the key tightening when "I had once laughed at my accent, I buried it," forcing confrontation with self-imposed exile. Cost is visible in moving "shame-encyclopedias to the far wall" though some intermediate beats could apply more pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the recurring motif of language/silence, culminating in "home has the shape of your mouth." The lost language stone and feather create concrete vehicles for abstract concepts of identity and belonging. The final image of speaking "my first true hello" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice establishes immediately with "bookstore climbed the mountain like ivy made of pages." The lyric register maintains consistency through inventive constructions like "mercury-glass seer" and "stones that looked like loaves of night." Dialogue carries authentic subtext when the seer says "We read via the texture of a feather here," revealing alternative value systems.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The mountain shelved storms behind its quiet" sets atmosphere while foreshadowing change. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph breaks create visual rhythm. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("remembering becomes painful") and one instance of elevated diction that slightly exceeds the POV's established register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of a bookstore that "substitutes reality nightly" offers genuine freshness, as does the mercury-glass seer who reads via feather texture. The specific synthesis of language-as-home with the physical journey through shifting shelves feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
