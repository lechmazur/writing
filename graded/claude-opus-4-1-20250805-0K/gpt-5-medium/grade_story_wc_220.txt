<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to reconnect with their sister is rooted in concrete details (the waxed leaf, the promise to follow) and builds through embodied action rather than declaration. The relationship with Harbor adds textural depth without becoming ornamental. Minor deduction for the convenience of the radio tech's cylinders appearing exactly when needed, though the discovery process feels earned through the market trade.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the final communication reweights distance as "not a wall but a lens" with visible emotional cost in the separation. The story teaches its pattern early (preserved objects holding messages) and pays it off through the relay activation. Slight deduction for the convenient placement of the relay tower, though it's adequately foreshadowed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Sluice's construction from "rib cages of buses and the skins of refrigerators" immediately establishes a lived-in post-apocalyptic world where every detail constrains choice. The waxed leaf functions as micro-setting that directly enables the climactic relay activation. The "wild hush" and sensory hierarchy (listening "with skin, rust, and memory") create atmospheric pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—bridging impossible distance—escalates from passive longing through active discovery (cylinders) to achieved connection with clear cost (the temporary nature of contact). The riddle creates genuine pressure that the narrator must solve. Minor deduction because the resolution relies partially on found information rather than pure protagonist agency, though the choice to pursue it remains active.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of distance as lens rather than wall, earned through concrete action. The preserved leaf accumulates meaning from childhood memory to compass to signal, avoiding ornamental symbolism. The sister's message about adjusting focus "together, with patience and scrap" resonates without moralizing, though it edges close to explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with consistent perceptual signature ("catalog a cloud by smell and a farewell by color") and controlled lyric compression. The prose maintains its textural density under pressure without becoming opaque. Dialogue (sister's voice, vendor's riddle) carries authentic subtext and advances plot. Minor moments of elevated diction ("fermented grief") occasionally strain but don't break voice coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs (Harbor's description establishes both setting and emotional tenor). Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, particularly in the relay activation sequence. Some figurative density in places ("shadows turned amber and violet") but it serves the accumulative pattern. Occasional near-synonyms ("cracked wasteland" appears twice) prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic survival with intimate family connection through preserved objects and secret messages feels fresh and specific. The phonograph cylinders as both historical artifacts and future-pointing maps show genuine ingenuity. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and the quiet ending pays off with earned emotional resonance rather than forced resolution.</comment>
