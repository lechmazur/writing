I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered discoveries and symbolic resonance rather than strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's "warmly inquisitive" approach drives concrete micro-choices throughout (handling the goggles, opening the diary, arranging letters). The final act of leaving the diary open shows earned transformation from retriever to keeper of memory, with visible cost in accepting responsibility for others' grief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator arranges the letters "warmly inquisitive, curious without trespass" and leaves the diary open—a decisive stance that reweights the ascent from assignment to sacred duty. The accumulative structure coheres through the ten-floor progression, each revealing deeper layers of Mirek's true mission. Cost is legible in accepting custodianship of "absences folded small."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire functions as both literal setting and metaphysical space where "the wind learned mercy." Spatial choreography tracks precisely through elevator rises, and environmental details (frost flowers, snow confetti, ice niches) directly enable the diary's decryption. The spire's description as "a cathedral that forgot applause" charges the final image of arranged letters.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from retrieving a logbook to becoming keeper of passengers' last letters. Each floor reveals increasing emotional weight, with the seventh floor's "cipher wheel drawn in negative" forcing active engagement. The final choice to arrange rather than clutch the letters shows agency with clear cost—accepting responsibility for others' unfinished business.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the encryption metaphor: "encrypted against despair, which reads without affection." The final insight "Keep what breaks you where you can love it without smoke" reweights the entire ascent as a lesson in holding grief with tenderness. No explicit moralizing; the resonance builds entirely through accumulated particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends liturgical cadence ("cold saints," "ascending servant") with technical precision ("isobars," "cipher wheel"). The perceptual signature—seeing mechanical systems as living beings ("the elevator shudders like a beast remembering its spine")—remains consistent. Minor drift toward elevated register in places like "absences folded small" slightly exceeds the established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful repetition of "On the [number] rise" creates rhythmic architecture. Information density high—most sentences advance discovery and emotional charge simultaneously. Deduction for occasional overwriting: "frost flowers lace the glass" and "coins across the metal" in adjacent lines; "warmly inquisitive" appears three times when twice would suffice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator ascent with spiritual journey, where physical rises map to deepening understanding. The encryption conceit—a diary coded "against despair, which reads without affection"—offers genuine insight about how we approach others' pain. Risk-taking in the lyric structure and metaphysical ending heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
