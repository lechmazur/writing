<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to find "the color of unspoken apologies" drives consistent action through embodied gestures (tracing lace, following compass). The internal contradiction between being a "slow-spoken bonsai tutor" who teaches patience versus the urgency of regret creates genuine tension. The final choice to return to teaching "differently" shows earned change with visible cost ("pruning only what asked").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern intensification through "rhythmically placid" repetition building to closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis—accepting the blue of regret and teaching differently—with felt cost in "No more shaping storms into bonsai just to admire how quiet their cages looked." Orientation anchors effectively (islet, after severance, compass-bearer).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The islet setting constrains choices through specific geography (cove, black rock, casuarina branches) that guides the ritual. Sensory detail filters through POV bias ("Wind moved through casuarina branches, and their whispering needles diffused the sky into kinder shavings of light"). The shallow cove where promises were broken charges the final reconfiguration, though some descriptions remain ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure as "rhythmically placid" builds from compass description to sea's hunger to final acceptance. The dominant stake—finding color/form for unspoken apologies—tightens when the lace reveals "muted cerulean that matched the regret I wore like weather." Cost is visible in releasing words "trimmed of their thorns" to the accepting sea.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between control (bonsai pruning) and acceptance (tides, storms). The final image of students learning to "hear their own unspoken apologies taking color" offers a non-literal answer about grief's transformation. The recurring "rhythmically placid" phrase accumulates meaning from mechanical patience to organic acceptance, avoiding stated morals.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through bonsai-filtered observations ("driftwood nested like unkempt bonsai," "pruning thoughts toward the wind"). Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm that modulates under pressure. The purposeful repetition of "rhythmically placid" teaches its pattern early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong rhythm control and information density, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("I spoke, not to summon forgiveness, but to find the color within the shape of the saying. / I said the words I should have said"). Some elevated diction strains POV credibility ("ferried myself," "quotidian salvage"). The "rhythmically placid" repetition works as taught pattern but borders on excessive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bonsai mastery with emotional navigation creates non-obvious angle on grief. The concept of reading apologies through antique lace pattern shows originality. The transformation from controlling storms to "pruning only what asked" feels earned through specific detail, though some metaphors (compass as tooth, ocean's lungs) feel slightly derivative.</comment>
