I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to free the idea trapped behind fear is consistently embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices, particularly in the courtyard scene where they choose to sing despite fear. The emotional progression from guardedness to vulnerability feels earned through specific sensory details like "the mirrors inhaled as though relieved." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around the "idea" early on that lacks full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator's ability to sing transforms from imprisoned to freed, with clear cost paid through vulnerability and risk. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through pattern breaks and density increases culminating in the mother's return as "idea." The journey from locked door to freed voice tracks causally through each beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The courtyard of broken mirrors becomes essential setting that constrains and enables the transformation—mirrors must align to create the path, they reflect hidden rooms of wanting, and eventually form a "cathedral." Environmental details like "shards bright as wet teeth" and starlight actively shape choices. Slightly lower for some abstract spatial moments early on.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating images and actions: from hiring the locksmith through the journey to the courtyard, to the mirrors aligning, to finally singing despite fear. The dominant stake—freeing the trapped idea to "sing the loss into a beginning"—tightens through each ritual step with visible cost in vulnerability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the extended metaphor of locks as belief systems and the transformation of loss into beginning. The lock of hair shifts from keepsake to "thing that grew without permission," reweighting the mother's absence. The final image of the locksmith carrying away "only what no longer bound" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression throughout—"a silence that would not open," "darkened, a crescent on my memory." The POV maintains consistent psychic distance with strong perceptual signature in how abstract concepts become physical. Excellent modulation during the singing sequence where syntax fragments appropriately under emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive prose with high information density—most sentences advance both literal and metaphorical tracks simultaneously. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, particularly in sequences like "He smiled and told me to sing anyway, because doors learn from daring." Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("cosmic possibility").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The conceit of a locksmith who unlocks psychological/emotional barriers through ritual and metaphysical spaces is fresh and fully committed. The synthesis of mother's departure, fear of singing, and locks as belief systems creates non-obvious connections. Risk-taking in the lyric mode and metaphysical elements heightens stakes while maintaining clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>
