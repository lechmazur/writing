I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through density of imagery and pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than causal plot progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prophet's precognitive forgetting creates genuine internal contradiction—he must arrange markers for a self he won't recognize, embodied through concrete actions like chalking statue mouths and arranging driftwood. His motivation to "capture the sound of growing older" drives consistent micro-choices throughout, though some interiority drifts toward abstraction ("letting the salt count him").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of statues "remembering for him," with visible cost in his acceptance of perpetual self-loss. The pattern of forgetting/marking/returning coheres through accumulated detail, teaching its logic early through the driftwood compass that "rearranged themselves like hands of a clock unwilling to point backward."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden functions as more than setting—its "drowned busts breathing mist" and "rusted torso" become tools the prophet uses to locate echoes, constraining his method of memory-making. Sensory hierarchy privileges sound and texture ("magnetic dreams settled like silt," "salt-thread pulling") over visuals, perfectly aligned with his listening mission.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation occurs through accumulative deepening as his actions intensify from passive listening to active marking to finally "whisper[ing] an empty year, then another" until "the air grew thick with all the time he had yet to lose." The cost crystallizes when "he felt almost possessed by time," accepting accompaniment over memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete paradox of preparing for one's own forgetting, with the final image of statues holding memory creating a non-literal answer about continuity despite loss. The recurring chalk becomes a tool of impermanence ("saw the chalked lines fading, and loved them for it"), avoiding abstraction through embodied particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—"listened, not with ears but with the thin bones of his wrists"—with syntax modulating to match discovery moments. The lyric compression serves the accumulative mode perfectly, teaching its elliptical pattern early and maintaining coherence even through purposeful temporal slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("gulls braided their cries into static"), though occasional abstract drift ("letting the metal remember"). The prose achieves genuine momentum through varied rhythm and strategic paragraph breaks that create visual breathing, with no loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of a "precognitively forgetful" prophet who must prepare for his own future amnesia offers genuine originality, executed through specific details like "magnetic dreams settled like silt." The risk of lyric accumulation over plot pays off through commitment to its internal logic.</comment>
