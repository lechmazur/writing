Looking at this story through an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and memory toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation crystallizes through embodied details like "Mara kept singing so I could follow, and I kept counting so she could stop," showing interdependence through concrete action. The final choice to continue building "the next necessary mercy" carries visible cost through the acceptance of ongoing absence. Minor deduction for some abstraction in middle sections ("geography of loss") that briefly dilutes the embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: "Reverse migration is never over; it is a tide that keeps time with absence." The closure reweights the opening's wounded station into a system for navigating loss, with clear cost in accepting Mara's permanent absence while maintaining connection. The accumulative structure coheres well, though one middle transition ("Night dons its hammered blue") creates brief spatial uncertainty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory work in "station exhales steam like a wounded animal" and "salt pans that mirror every star that forgot to burn out." The patina bronze censer foot functions as micro-setting that constrains choice when it becomes the compass pivot. Spatial choreography occasionally blurs during the inland journey sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from mechanical repair to emotional navigation, with the dominant stake (finding/following Mara) tightening when the compass "does not lead me to Mara; it leads me with her." The cost manifests in accepting permanent separation while maintaining connection. The accumulative pressure builds effectively though lacks one sharp reversal moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the concrete metaphor of reverse migration—"not return but recognition, not recovery but route." The final image of following absence home offers a non-literal answer to loss without moralizing. The vowels on driftwood as "a private language for repairing the torn world" perfectly embodies theme through specific action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "The tide has gone to sleep behind me, leaving salt pans that mirror every star that forgot to burn out." The perceptual signature stays consistent—someone who counts and maps to manage grief. Slight register elevation in places ("Raw solace lives in the act") but mostly maintains the established texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong moments like "rasps through salt and static like a match lit underwater" show excellent compression. However, abstract phrases like "geography of loss" and "necessary mercy" appear without earning their weight through concrete grounding. Some filter constructions ("I feel her voice rise") could be more immediate. Information density is generally high with good propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of signal station as grief compass, with the specific innovation of "reverse migration" as accepting absence rather than seeking return. The transformation of technical repair into emotional navigation feels earned. The vowels on driftwood as cardinal marks shows genuine originality in rendering loss tangible.</comment>
