<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to bridge states ("solid to liquid, liquid to vapor, word to world, grief to gratitude") drives methodical actions with embodied tension between duty and loss. The final realization that the task was "not to own transition, but to keep company as it bridged" shows earned wisdom through concrete struggle, though some interiority borders on over-articulation ("haunted ambitions that never settled").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through ritual actions (reading tablets, adjusting nodes, planting seed) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator accepts companionship with transition rather than mastery. The cost is legible in "the vacuum that remains" and the foreclosed path of calling the spirit back, with the seed's sprouting and arbor's renewed harmony confirming the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor functions as active setting—its "barky pulses," drifting rails, and magnetic fields constrain every action from tablet translation to seed planting. Sensory hierarchy reflects the translator's priorities (grooves over ink, field strengths as verbs), and the environment directly shapes the final transformation when "the arbor releases a soft chime that finds my ribs."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating ritual pressures: from reading tablets to correcting cadence to planting the seed, each action deepens engagement with the physics of transition. The dominant stake (understanding transition without retrieval) faces consistent pressure through the drifting rails and warming seed, though the conflict remains primarily internal without sharp reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of translation itself—between states, disciplines, and conditions—culminating in the insight that transition requires companionship rather than ownership. The recurring "touching distance" motif gains resonance from initial longing through final acceptance, and the seed's transformation parallels the narrator's shift from haunted ambition to patient witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice emerges through specialized lexicon ("cuneiform translator," "conjugation of force") and consistent perceptual signature favoring tactile over visual ("hands trust grooves more than ink"). The analogical thinking pattern structures perception throughout ("The arbor is a sentence... The seed is a clause... I am the comma"), though occasional register elevation ("haunted ambitions") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The tablets list rituals for maintaining the orchard of suspended trunks and the breathing rails" establishes world, task, and stakes). However, some abstract phrasing ("haunted ambitions that never settled," "touching distance to storms") and occasional paraphrase loops ("Not to call her back, but to meet the edge where bonds loosen") reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of physics and translation through embodied ritual work creates a fresh angle on grief and transformation. The specific world-building (magnetic arbor, knowledge fruit seeds, field strengths as verbs) transforms familiar loss narrative through unique conceptual architecture, with risk-taking in the lyric-scientific hybrid paying off in the resonant final image.</comment>
