I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through sonic/vibrational imagery and reaches closure through resonant reconfiguration rather than decisive plot action.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marek's "logically emotional" nature manifests through concrete actions—graphing feelings, vibrational matching, offering the key's weight rather than keeping it. The seeker's transformation from "hungry as gulls" to choosing to be "unarmed" shows genuine change earned through the stone's sonic intervention, though her shift could use one more beat of resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as two former adversaries become co-keepers through sonic absolution, with visible cost in the seeker's acknowledged drowned village and ache. The accumulative build through sound imagery coheres, though the seeker's arrival and transformation compress slightly. Who/where/when anchored clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina and lighthouse create atmospheric pressure through "ice floes nudged the pilings like shy animals" and windows as "freckles of dying light." The Throat of Tides within the Fresnel lens constrains choices—only the key can "unlock the storm and silence it again"—making setting essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from protection to transformation as Marek chooses "sonic absolution" over force, and the seeker's hunger shifts from ransom to cooperation. The cost lands in her admission about the drowned village and the "smile that did not hide its ache," though the transformation happens quickly for this word count.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concept of adaptation versus force—"force vibrates the wrong way"—culminating in shared guardianship where "human hands asking weather to listen." The stone's "low chord that remembered drowned orchards and rebuilt towns" offers forgiveness through alignment, not erasure, avoiding simple redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "fleshly ethereal hush" and "counting turns the way sailors count scars." Dialogue feels natural—"I wanted to ransom the coast because my village drowned"—though both characters occasionally share similar registers. The POV holds steady through Marek's perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong rhythm with varied sentence lengths and evocative imagery: "The chord filled the space between them like a third person with perfect manners." Some figurative density in places ("hungry angels," "patient lung") but serves the accumulative texture. Information density high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of "sonic absolution" as conflict resolution freshly transforms the lighthouse-keeper trope. The stone that "draws storms like hungry angels" yet offers forgiveness through vibrational matching creates an original magical system. The seeker's transformation from antagonist to co-keeper through sound rather than force feels earned.</comment>
