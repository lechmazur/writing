<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict between terror and trust effectively drives the closure, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("I felt terror and trust braid into something like promise"). The transformation from isolated stunt double to vulnerable brother lands with visible cost through specific embodied details like "my palms clear with fear-sweat." Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("transformative betrayal") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with patterns of doubling, codes, and hidden identities building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the brothers unite through shared vulnerability. The closure lands with felt cost ("I would keep falling, but now toward us, not away") and the drive lens holds consistently. The orientation anchors (rusted library, midnight, stunt double) establish clearly within the first lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rusted library functions as more than backdrop—its iron stacks, skylight ladder, and hidden steel box constrain the search and enable discovery. Sensory details like "memory scraping against sky" and "the shell shaped words; the stacks breathed sibilants of iron" create atmosphere while advancing action. The child's cast with galaxy paintings serves as both object and map, though some descriptions lean abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from discovering the identity theft, to decoding the cast's cipher, to finding the brother on the roof, each revelation tightening options. The dominant stake—proving vulnerability as power—faces genuine test when confronting the brother who stole the narrator's life. Cost is visible in the choice to "return the credits and keep the courage."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the doubling motif—stunt double/life double, fear as "lever not lock," vulnerability as power. The final image of falling "toward us, not away" resonantly reweights the opening's isolation. Subtext operates effectively through the child's cast as treaty and the shell's changing whispers, though occasional explicit statements ("vulnerability is power") slightly diminish subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled compression ("My job used to be falling for others") and effective short declaratives that build rhythm. The perceptual signature—cataloging fears like injuries, reading codes in smudges—stays consistent. Some register elevation in peak moments ("transformative betrayal cutting clean") doesn't quite match the embodied voice elsewhere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The iron stacks groaned like ships") but occasional overwriting ("transformative betrayal," "firmly adaptive") and some template structures in the middle section. Information density is high in the decoding sequence. Minor paraphrase loops around the vulnerability theme reduce momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stunt double profession with identity theft creates non-obvious angle on doubling/authenticity. The specific detail of using broken bone dates as lock combination shows ingenuity. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and non-linear revelation pays off, though the core betrayal-to-reconciliation arc follows familiar patterns.</comment>
