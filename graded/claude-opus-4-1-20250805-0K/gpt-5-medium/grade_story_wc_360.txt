<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's habit of "borrowing personalities" creates genuine internal contradiction as they channel Maris while struggling with their own courage, and the couple's grief-driven request forces a meaningful choice about empathy's mathematics. The final realization about using ambiguity "to disorient fear" rather than protect themselves shows earned change through concrete experience with the halo fragment and letterpress work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise as the narrator sets "a salvaged future tense" while accepting the sky's vanishing stars, with visible cost in their smallest signature and the fragment left to "drink in the vanished light." The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the couple's transformation and the narrator's self-confession, though the orientation anchors take slightly too long to fully crystallize (the observatory relationship clarifies late).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The topaz workshop with its oil/citrus/dust smells, the halo fragment's warming glow, and the observatory's blinking dome create a lived-in magical realist space that constrains choices (the fragment only works when sentences align to truth). The "vanishing stars" timeframe and the physical letterpress operations (locking chase, inking forme, registering sheets) ground the abstract concept of transposed empathy in tactile detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake of understanding "the mathematics of emotion" escalates through the couple's grief test, forcing the narrator to confront their borrowed courage and finally accept their own relationship to fear and forgiveness. The halo fragment's response to truth creates consistent pressure, though the conflict could tighten more decisively in the middle section before the self-confession.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of empathy as "rotation on a circle no one owns" emerges through concrete letterpress work and the couple's transformation, avoiding abstract philosophizing. The final question about mutual forgiveness between narrator and sky reweights the vanishing stars as both loss and cleansing absence, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement ("Transposed empathy is not charity").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistent lyric density with controlled rhythm ("I lock the chase and ink the forme while the night forgets names") and character-specific perception (seeing emotion as mathematics, typography as breath). The POV holds steady through the Maris-borrowing without head-hopping, and diction stays within the letterpress operator's plausible lexicon of technical and poetic registers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Between vanishing stars, I register the sheets and listen for the click of metal logic becoming breath"), though some passages contain mild paraphrase loops around the empathy concept. The prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful fragments, with only occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the POV's established range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of letterpress craft with emotional mathematics offers a genuinely fresh angle, and the halo fragment that "conducts feeling into type metal" creates an original magical system. The specific detail of transposed empathy as "a musical key change that preserves melody" and the couple's differentiated responses (arithmetic vs. angle) show authentic vision beyond template grief narratives.</comment>
