<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator's contradictory impulses—guilt versus self-preservation, methodical mapping versus emotional chaos—play out through concrete actions like following graffiti coordinates while carrying the brother's accordion. The final renunciation of asking the river to be smaller than itself lands with visible cost: "I marked the margin with a stick and wrote in my field book that the river was itself." Internal conflict manifests physically through the bellows on ribs matching breath rhythms.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as bathroom graffiti coordinates lead to physical stations of grief, each location deepening the narrator's understanding of complicity. The Resonant Reconfiguration arrives when the narrator stops asking the river to mirror himself—a clear before/after with felt cost in accepting the brother's death resulted from professional hubris. "River does what it was asked to do" transforms from verdict to instruction through accumulated site visits.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The disused station functions as emotional architecture—"green chapel, pews of nettle"—while specific coordinates from bathroom tiles constrain the narrator's path of reckoning. The river's physical properties (shallows where the body caught, sluice gate where corners were cut) directly shape choices and revelations. Sensory hierarchy reflects the chronicler's professional attention: "measuring the pressure of ink, weighing the pause at every comma."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation as each graffiti coordinate reveals deeper complicity: from general mapping error to specific corner-cutting at the sluice gate where "I had told the agency the river would crest lower." The dominant stake—self-forgiveness versus truth—tightens when the narrator must enter the shallow where the brother's body caught. Cost is unmistakable: accepting that professional certainty killed his brother.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The accordion bellows transforms from brother's "battered metronome of breath" to the narrator's own breathing apparatus for reconciliation, never stating its thematic weight. "River does what it was asked to do" resonates without moralizing, shifting from accusation to acceptance. The final image of marking the margin while acknowledging the river's true self offers a non-literal answer to whether forgiveness is possible through accurate witnessing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature emerges through the chronicler's professional lens applied to grief: "treating stall walls as a river cross section, a transect of voices sedimented by time." Voice modulates from clinical precision ("isobars that tricked me") to vulnerable admission ("my heart, skittish but awake"). No head-hopping, consistent focalization through specialized vocabulary that serves emotional revelation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density high throughout—"storm drunk with certainty" compresses professional hubris and emotional blindness. Syntactic variety supports rhythm: short declarations ("My method is daringly methodical") alternate with complex accumulations. Some minor repetition of "daringly methodical" and occasional filter constructions ("I had read, once") prevent higher scoring, though prose remains propulsive and clear at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bathroom graffiti as map coordinates transforms a cliché grief journey into something specific and earned—professional tools of measurement applied to unmeasurable loss. The brother as busker who died warning others while the narrator's faulty flood map killed him offers fresh moral complexity. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens rather than obscures the emotional stakes.</comment>
