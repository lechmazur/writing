<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrator's desire to "sculpt identity from experience" creates genuine internal tension against their role as collective archivist, with the plum memory providing concrete embodiment. The final acceptance of being "both binder and page" shows earned change through specific cost (stepping into the forecourt, risking "an instance that hurts the page"). Motivation remains consistent but abstract passages like "preemptively nostalgic for losses not yet tallied" lack the embodied specificity needed for higher scores.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator transforms from passive archivist to active participant, with visible cost in risking their own vulnerable memory. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the crystallizing moment where "collective memory had room for my own edge." Orientation anchors early ("stormlit observatory above clouds") and causality tracks through the narrator's growing discomfort with being only "a binder, not a page."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt constrains choice by "translating footsteps into names" and the monuments' shadow measurements directly shape the archival practice. Setting achieves integration when "the forecourt caught the fruit's sugar... and returned a chair scraping gently open," making environment responsive to action. The observatory's position "above clouds" and "after fog becomes solid" creates a distinct otherworldly logic that supports the conceptual work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize around the narrator's identity crisis: remaining mere archivist versus risking personal vulnerability. The tension deepens through "What if I was only a binder... and not a page" to the decisive action of stepping into the forecourt. Cost becomes visible when they must "risk an instance that hurts the page" and share their plum memory, though the accumulative design softens traditional escalation markers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between collective and individual memory, with the plum memory serving as concrete particular that resists abstraction. The final integration where "collective memory had room for my own edge" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Lightning's assurance "you are allowed to be a choir and a solo" risks thematic echo but remains embedded in scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "summer-quill archivist, inked in weather and habit" and "the deepening hush afterward felt like a page turning without a hand." Voice maintains lyric consistency though occasionally drifts toward abstract elevation ("preemptively nostalgic for losses not yet tallied") that strains against the more grounded moments. The POV remains stable and the experimental compression serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments of compression like "We took conjecture like bread, breaking it to share hypotheses" demonstrate control. However, abstract runs weaken momentum: "preemptively nostalgic for losses not yet tallied" and similar elevated passages create opacity without clear payoff. The prose achieves density but sacrifices clarity in places, particularly in the opening third where conceptual language dominates concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of an observatory that archives collective memory through weather and shadow measurement offers genuine freshness. The specific synthesis of meteorological and memorial functions, plus the detail of "fog becomes solid," creates a non-obvious world. The transformation from passive archivist to active participant follows expected arc but the sensory specificity (plum memory, crystal forecourt) elevates beyond template.</comment>
