<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to preserve practical methods over competing narratives drives consistent choices throughout, with internal contradiction visible when they feel "the old ache rise from my throat to my skull" before choosing action over argument. The final choice to keep the cog "because it had proven itself" shows earned agency with visible cost (risking conflict with the three authorities).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through sedimentary imagery and method-collecting toward a Decisive Change where the protagonist proves their philosophy through action, transforming skeptics. The orientation anchors (sewer philosopher, post-plague city) establish immediately, and the closure lands with visible cost when the three men's "narratives damp as coat sleeves" acknowledge defeat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drowned library's "sedimentary layers" from "pamphlets to treaties to clay" creates a lived-in vertical geography that constrains movement ("knee room") and enables the protagonist's method. Setting actively pressures the climax when "silt humps rose like sleeping whales" threaten flooding, though some descriptive passages lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from philosophical preservation to immediate physical danger when the sluice gates threaten to flood "while people were still counting banners." The protagonist's choice to lead the authorities through rising water rather than surrender the cog shows agency under pressure with clear cost—risking drowning to prove their point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between "methods" versus "narratives," crystallizing in "not all rebellion is arson." The chronometer cog transforms from time-keeping device to symbol of practical knowledge surviving ideological battles, with the final image of the working sluice wheel embodying the theme without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains "abrasive calm" through controlled, philosophical diction like "I fail upward into questions" and "stubborn arithmetic." Some register drift occurs with elevated metaphors ("time itself, a method disguised as an ornament") that strain against the established sewage-dwelling perspective, though dialogue differentiates the three authorities effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong propulsion through varied syntax and concrete imagery, but figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("the water remembers more than the people do," "a tooth from time itself"). Template cadence appears in the "Once, I rebuilt" / "Another time I proved" sequence, and some paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("These are not miracles; they are stubborn arithmetic" restates the philosophical stance).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The post-plague sewer philosopher who values ancient methods over modern narratives offers a fresh angle on knowledge preservation. The specific synthesis of maritime chronometry with flood management creates an unexpected but earned resolution, though the competing ideologies (Tide-Priests, Cleaners, Engineers) feel somewhat schematic.</comment>
