I'll evaluate this literary story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds meaning through layered imagery, sonic patterns, and conceptual density rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scholar's reticence manifests beautifully through embodied details like "the hinges apologize for opening" and his preference to "testify by playing" rather than speaking. His motivation to trace meaning's growth after dictionaries end creates genuine stakes. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction in middle passages about growth patterns.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the scholar discovers "to forgive how slowly [growth] reveals itself" through the crystal's accumulated sounds. The piece teaches its accumulative pattern early with the crystal holding "memories of every whispered question." Cost appears in "scars where pages fought back" and the acceptance of language's migration beyond dictionaries.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The shadowed library and crystal function as active constraints—the "suspended hush" shapes every interaction, the crystal's sonic reflections drive discovery. Excellent micro-setting work with "dust becomes constellations of practiced neglect." The environment consistently pressures choices through its accumulated silence and memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes build through accumulation: from examining growth patterns to preparing testimony for the printers. The crystal's responses ("thin cracking," "river reversing under ice") deepen with each index card. The final commitment to let language "become someone else's discovery" shows meaningful renunciation with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of listening to the crystal's memories—growth as refusal, boundaries staying porous while keeping shape. The ending's forgiveness of slow revelation resonates without moralizing. Strong integration of dictionary-ending premise with deeper questions about meaning's evolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "language itself has climbed into the rafters to think." POV maintains consistent interiority and perceptual signature throughout. Excellent modulation between contemplative passages and concrete sensory moments. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"He cups it in a hand nicked by paper" shows action, character history, and relationship to knowledge. Some repetition of "suspended hush" and occasional abstract passages about growth prevent higher scoring. Strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dictionary-ending apocalypse with sonic archaeology creates genuine originality. The crystal as memory-holder and the scholar's wordless testimony method feel earned and specific. Risk-taking in the lyrical approach pays off with coherent accumulative structure.</comment>
