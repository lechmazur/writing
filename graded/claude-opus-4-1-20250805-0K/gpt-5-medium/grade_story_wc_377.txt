I'll evaluate this literary story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Iri's seasonal muteness creates genuine constraint that shapes every interaction, with the Archive Keepers' choice earned through prior sensory experience rather than epiphany. The contradiction between preserving wonder versus filing truth drives authentic tension. Minor deduction for the Keepers' somewhat uniform response despite their museum-shine distinctiveness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the Keepers depart carrying "only a new slowness in their steps" after experiencing truth through resonance rather than documentation. Cost is legible in their abandoned claim and transformed pace. The piece teaches its pattern early through bell-tuning as metaphor for attention, though the transition to the Keepers' arrival could be slightly smoother.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The whispering bluff and cloud-world create immediate atmosphere, with the iceberg fragment's transformation from "colorless as sleep" to trapped breath constraining how truth can be accessed. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as Keepers move through the sculpture frames. The setting actively shapes choice—the ridge's elevation literally and figuratively removes participants from ordinary discourse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder's color versus archiving truth—escalates through the Keepers' physical approach to claim the shard, then deepens when Iri's gestural response transforms their understanding. One Keeper's hand falling away marks genuine renunciation with cost. The conflict resolution through sensory experience rather than argument fits the accumulative lens perfectly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the opposition of ledgers versus listening, with the iceberg fragment embodying patience that "few souls survive." The final image of Iri tuning "the day the way some water tunes stone" offers a non-literal answer about preservation through attention rather than documentation. No explicit moralizing; the story trusts its imagery completely.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—"furled clouds," "careful hand," "transparent harmonies"—with syntax that breathes like the wind-played sculptures. The seasonal muteness is handled with perfect consistency, never cheating with indirect dialogue. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in "museum shine" and "alphabets like bruises" that briefly exceeds Iri's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "She was a bell tuner because bells could fail, and failure was honest enough to guide." Some figurative density in peak moments ("lanterns over a dark river within each listener") but serves the accumulative pattern. Clean prose momentum with varied sentence openings and natural rhythm throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of bell-tuning as a form of truth-telling through resonance rather than language offers genuine freshness. The seasonal muteness constraint forces innovative storytelling solutions. The specific detail of "salted bell lips with powdered ice" and graphite chalk tools prevents generic mysticism, grounding the fantastic in tactile craft.</comment>
