<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to recover lost memories of their sister drives concrete actions (visiting the chemist, exhuming the memory glass), with internal conflict between accepting loss and pursuing recovery. The final choice to seal the memory with the wildflowers shows earned resolution with visible cost—the memories return to objects, not to the narrator's mind directly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure: the narrator understands their work "keeps a path through change" while accepting that memories live in objects rather than minds. The beached whale as gravity disruptor anchors causality early, and the memory retrieval sequence pays off with felt cost—memories can be recovered but not reintegrated as before.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber and memory corridor create vivid micro-settings that constrain choices (crystals archive what's "too soft to keep itself," the corridor leads to deleted memories). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("gleaming silence that fits inside my lungs"), though some descriptions lean ornamental without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering sister's memories—escalates from passive loss to active retrieval, with gravity pockets as physical obstacles that mirror emotional disorientation. The narrator's agency drives the exhumation and glass-pressing sequence, though the middle section could tighten the connection between gravity distortions and memory loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of memory, gravity, and preservation without explicit moralizing. The final realization that the lantern lighter's work "keeps a path through change" reweights the opening's routine task as essential navigation through loss, with the tin of wildflowers serving as a physical anchor for intangible memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("a tug then a shrug, like a tide with private instructions") and consistent perceptual signature focused on light, weight, and containment. The prose maintains its poetic register under pressure without sacrificing clarity, and the narrator's selective attention to gravity and memory feels character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong sentence-level craft with varied rhythm and purposeful compression ("people have been forgetting where they put names"). Some passages risk ornamental density ("gleaming silence," "gravity seed bursting the page") but information density remains high, with most lines advancing both literal and thematic work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The conceit of gravity pockets causing memory deletion offers fresh transformation of loss narrative, with specific details (salt crystals as memory archives, glass memory sheets) creating non-obvious synthesis. The risk of lyric abstraction pays off through concrete anchors and the earned final insight about preservation through change.</comment>
