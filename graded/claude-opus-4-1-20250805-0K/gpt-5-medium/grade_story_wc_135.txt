I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through layered imagery (valve, window-tapping, parade routes) building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "absences have shifted, no longer voids but channels navigated."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "compile fragments into meaning" drives consistent micro-choices (turning the valve, marking parade routes, teaching the harbor to practice). The woman's desire to leave traces "that do not wash away" creates genuine tension against her exile-learned "discipline of silence." Minor deduction for slight emotional distance in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with "absences have shifted, no longer voids but channels navigated," showing clear before/after with felt cost. The accumulative structure builds coherently through valve-turning, window-tapping, and route-tracing toward this reconfiguration. Slight opacity in the exile's specific nature prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The harbor setting constrains choices beautifully—"quay stones still glisten," "masts draw staff lines across clouds." The valve's physical manipulation ("ports green as lichen") and the window as interface for tapping/tracing directly shape the ritual's development. Environment actively participates in the closure's "tide carries moonlight" image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from receiving the valve, to collaborative window-tapping, to passersby responding ("dockworker pauses, his boots squeaking"). The stake of giving the harbor "a sound it can practice" intensifies through "staggered intervals" becoming a teachable rhythm. Cost is visible but could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the concrete work of transforming absence into navigable channels. The valve as "metronome of remembering" and the distinction between monuments and practice ("traces survive if we build them into practice") offer resonant, non-literal answers. The final image of harbor carrying their work "like tide carries moonlight" perfectly reweights earlier material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "I take notes like salt takes shape in a handprint, brief and true until the next wave." The perceptual signature of cataloging absences and reading patterns remains consistent. Dialogue carries subtext well ("she gives me the weather instead"). Minor repetitive patterns in mid-section prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with memorable lines, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "herald's trumpet valve" appears with slight variations multiple times; "staggered intervals" repeats without evolution. Some filter-verb clustering ("I ask," "I tell") in dialogue sections. The crystalline opening and closing paragraphs demonstrate capability undermined by middle-section redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of an "ocean-spray archivist" cataloging absences after exile offers genuine freshness. The transformation of a trumpet valve fragment into a practice tool for collective memory shows originality. The specific synthesis of harbor, music, and return creates something memorable, though some metaphorical connections feel slightly forced.</comment>
