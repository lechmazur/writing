I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern until the final reconfiguration reweights the opening premise.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation emerges through embodied details like "the headset pricking, the hearing aid warm in my palm like a pocketed sparrow." The revelation that the man called unconsciously through grief shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. Minor deduction for the child caller's underdeveloped agency after the reveal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where "incidental heroism, nothing I intended" crystallizes the premise that connection matters more than solving. The twist that the man is the actual caller reweights the entire investigation. Cost is visible in "grief redialed his sleep" and the years of loss. Slight opacity around the child's exact nature prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory work: "fog slides in as if the city has decided to lie down and sleep," "walls of last moments lean toward each other." The hearing aid functions as micro-setting that constrains choice. Spatial choreography occasionally blurs during transitions between gallery and man's room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from taking the call, to following the hearing aid's pulses, to discovering the photograph, to the revelation about the true caller. The dominant stake—finding connection across loss—tightens when we learn the child died years ago. Cost lands in the final shared listening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the right ear as "a habit of tenderness," the hearing aid kept running "to hear her steps across the old tiles." The final image of three people connected across death and distance offers a non-literal answer about how grief creates its own communication. No explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "I am a contact tracer for hearts, assigned to map the old currents before they drown the living." Perceptual signature clear in how the narrator reads the city and objects. Brief dialogue serves its purpose. Minor register elevation in places like "incidental heroism" slightly above the established texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The security guard sleeps, mouth open like an exit." Some figurative density in peak beats ("swallowed star," "exhausted mailmen") without clear payoff. Generally clean prose with good momentum, though occasional abstraction like "listening becomes a structure I can walk through."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of detective procedural with supernatural communication through the "contact tracer for hearts" frame. The specific detail of tracking grief through a decades-old hearing aid feels original. The revelation that unconscious grief can dial out transforms the premise. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode heightens rather than obscures.</comment>
