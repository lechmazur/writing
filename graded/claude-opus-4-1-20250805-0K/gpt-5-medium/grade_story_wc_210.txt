<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Iria's motivation to rebuild through collective labor rather than wishes is clear and consistent, with embodied details like "salt in her coat and ash under her fingernails." The final choice to begin without waiting for ideal conditions shows earned agency. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "reimagine civilization" that could be more grounded in specific character need.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the amber bottle's "faint ticking" signals collective life beginning without wishes, with visible cost in the labor and arguments. The piece teaches its pattern of rejection-then-building early and maintains it. Slight deduction for abstract moments like "large things are made of small rooms" that momentarily thin the texture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cove setting with abandoned lanterns and beached skiff provides concrete constraints that shape Iria's actions—she must work with ruins and debris. The amber bottle as micro-setting constrains choices throughout. Deduction for some generic descriptors ("ruined streets," "exhausted sky") and missed opportunities to make the post-wish world more physically specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rebuilding without divine intervention—escalates from solitary planning to collective action, with the sailor's arrival as meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in the labor, first arguments, and foreclosed path of easy wishes. Minor deduction for the relatively smooth accumulation of helpers without significant friction or setback.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the amber bottle metaphor—people must "pour into it" rather than extract from it, reversing the wish-economy. The final image of "faint ticking" resonates as collective heartbeat without stating the moral. Some philosophical abstractions ("reimagine civilization from habits of how hands meet") occasionally overtell the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with purposeful compression and taught patterns like "step by step through working memory." POV remains stable with Iria throughout. Deduction for occasional register drift into abstract philosophy ("authority would be labor shared and witnessed") and some dialogue that reads more written than spoken.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("revival...revival," "large things...large"), some template phrasing ("She [verb], then [verb]"), and abstract register drift in peak moments. The "faint ticking" closure image lands cleanly despite earlier density issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reversal of wish-economy into labor-economy offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic rebuilding. The amber bottle as unopenable vessel that collects rather than dispenses is inventive. Some elements feel derivative (abandoned town, returning exile) but the specific synthesis of alchemical knowledge with communal rebuilding distinguishes the piece.</comment>
