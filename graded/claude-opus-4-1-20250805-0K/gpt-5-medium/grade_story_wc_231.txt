<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse keeper's motivation to honor the stranger's final gesture drives consistent micro-choices through investigating gaps and interpreting coded signals. His "softly persistent" nature manifests through methodical observation and the willingness to perform the foolish signal code. The internal logic holds as he moves from receiving the boutonniere to discovering its meaning through "borrowed memories" of the girl who waited.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the keeper's act of signaling transforms the stranger's death from meaningless to witnessed, with clear emotional cost in "what is rescued does not need a shrine, only a witness." The accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer (notch, scratches, memories) to reweight the dock's significance. The borrowed memory mechanism and the girl's backstory integrate smoothly to reveal the boutonniere's meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The opal dock functions as micro-setting that constrains investigation through its specific notches and scratches that hold memory. Vivid selective detail like "nautical twilight" and "mist pulled itself into ribbons" creates atmosphere while the dock's physical details (third piling, worn notch) enable discovery. The setting actively participates in the resolution through its ability to "give back what I have touched."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation as the investigation reveals layers: the stranger's gesture leads to the notch, which unlocks the girl's story, culminating in the keeper's choice to signal despite uncertainty. The dominant stake—honoring a dying man's final gesture—gains weight through discovered parallels. Cost is visible in accepting the role of witness to "stubborn dead" and performing a "foolish code."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of witnessing—the dock holds memory, the keeper holds vigil, the signal bridges absence. The Edelweiss transforms from mysterious token to symbol of faith kept across death. The final insight that "what is rescued does not need a shrine, only a witness" reweights all prior investigation without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyric compression and selective perception ("gaps in stories, gaps in timetables"). The keeper's philosophical bent shows in constructions like "the tide keeps its own ledger of names" and "witnessed isolation has a weight to it." Rhythm modulates effectively between contemplative observation and discovery beats, maintaining the "softly persistent" character throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional abstract phrasing like "witnessed isolation has a weight to it" could be more concrete. Prose rhythm varies naturally with effective paragraph breaks. Some elevated diction ("nautical twilight," "stubborn dead") fits the keeper's contemplative voice but occasionally borders on overwriting in phrases like "the particular gap where a final breath wants to be a letter."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper as reader of human signals rather than maritime ones, with the dock as repository of memory. The "borrowed memories" mechanism and investigation through "observing gaps" offer original approaches to revelation. The specific detail of the Edelweiss notch and coded knocking creates authenticity beyond generic mystery.</comment>
