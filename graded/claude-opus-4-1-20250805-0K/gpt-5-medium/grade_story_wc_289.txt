Looking at this story, I'll evaluate under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration where two estranged lovers reconnect through the art installation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation as ghostwriter-artist is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like "watching how they walked, each bearing stormlight as if it were a shy animal." The lovers' reconciliation feels earned through accumulated details, though their individual characterizations remain somewhat thin beyond their shared loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure with clear anchoring (lotus temple, after rain) and a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the lovers "rejoin the city, arm by arm." The installation serves as effective causality, though the cost could be more visceral—we sense emotional stakes but don't feel the full weight of what the year's silence cost them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory specificity: "dripping and shimmering like a patient lantern set upon green glass," "raindrops beading along lotus petals, each droplet a tiny window." The temple-pond setting actively shapes the installation's design and the brass bell's sound "traveling across the lilies like a thin fish" charges the reconciliation moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reconnecting the lovers through art) builds steadily as visitors add leaves, culminating when "they stepped onto parallel threads that converged at the waiting bowl." The installation creates genuine pressure, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly without a moment of real resistance or doubt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the central metaphor of threads connecting all things, with the thrush's nest as "blueprint for how desire curls and holds without choking." The final image of two people rejoining "like reeds remembering how to stand together" resonates without stating its meaning, though it edges toward the poetic-abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive lyrical voice with controlled rhythm: "I am a love letter ghostwriter, hired by strangers who cannot arrange their hearts." POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance, though some phrases like "prismatic quiet" repeat without evolution and occasional abstractions ("keeper of secrets") could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though "prismatic quiet" appears three times without variation and some phrases lean purple ("stormlight as if it were a shy animal"). The piece maintains good momentum despite occasional abstract flights, and the final sentence lands with appropriate weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of a ghostwriter creating public art to reunite his clients feels fresh, and specific details like "traders with plastic bags, lovers with silence" ground the piece. The thrush's nest as organizing metaphor and the participatory installation show genuine ingenuity, though the resolution's emotional beats follow expected patterns.</comment>
