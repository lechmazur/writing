I'll evaluate this story through the lens of **Accumulative/Textural** design, as the piece builds through sensory accumulation and pattern density toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara accepts what she's been trying to drop.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (placing prism, reading frost), and Mara's skepticism-to-belief arc lands with visible cost when she speaks the name "she swore she would not say again." However, the narrator's internal experience remains somewhat abstract ("attention is a candle in windy places") without sufficient embodied contradiction during the peak revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly when Mara accepts her grief through the frost's revelation, with cost visible in "the bleak relief of someone finally believing her own weather." The accumulative structure coheres through frost patterns, prism colors, and the arbor's amplification, though the mechanics of how objects "absorb emotions" could be more precisely dramatized rather than asserted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The quartz arbor "veined with minerals that drank the morning" and the frost patterns on the car window create vivid, functional settings that enable the central revelation. The sensory work is selective and purposeful, though the arbor's specific properties beyond amplification remain underutilized in constraining choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from proving a theory to confronting Mara's suppressed grief, with the frost revealing "a boy gripping a birthday ribbon" and "two people rehearsed an ending" building pressure. The cost lands when Mara "pressed her palm to it, and her mouth formed the name," though the narrator faces minimal personal risk or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the concept that "objects do not forgive or accuse...they witness, and we decide afterward," avoiding explicit moralizing. The "truthful lies" motif resonates through the frost's revelations and the narrator's method, with the final image of Mara "more ready to carry what she had been trying to drop" offering a non-literal answer to grief's persistence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent mystical-scientific register with distinctive phrases like "the kind that turns breath into clouded confession" and "fate is a lattice." Dialogue feels natural with subtext ("Show me your method, she said, with the careful cruelty"), though some abstractions like "listening arranged into geometry" strain clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("The structure grew from the hill like frozen rain") with good rhythm variation. However, abstract phrases like "a discipline that forgives nothing" and slight redundancy in explaining the method ("I told Mara the glass remembered because it had listened") create minor drag without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of objects absorbing emotions feels fresh when grounded in specific images (frost patterns revealing faces, prism colors mapping grief). The integration of mysticism with scientific skepticism through Mara's conversion offers an original angle, though the concept itself echoes familiar paranormal investigation tropes.</comment>
