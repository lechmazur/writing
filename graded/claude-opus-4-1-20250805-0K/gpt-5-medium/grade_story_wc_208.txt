<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "scaffold complexity with simplicity" drives concrete choices throughout, from reading wood knots to building the driftwood gate. Internal conflict between solitary craft and timewoven alliances resolves through embodied action rather than epiphany. The final vow to "keep building bridges out of broken weather" earns its resonance through prior struggle with the storm and materials.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens coheres as sensory details and craft metaphors build toward the Resonant Reconfiguration of the archway transformed into "a door through." The slide's revelation of "timewoven alliances" reweights the narrator's solitary journey into collective work across time. Cost is visible in the storm's physical toll and the choice to remain "perpetually learning" rather than achieving mastery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway constrains and enables the central action—its "rib cage of stone" provides both shelter and canvas for the transformation. Sensory precision ("air tastes ferric," "turbine-hum reverie") filters through the sculptor's craft-focused perception. The driftwood's "surfaces spun to satin by restless years" embodies time's patient work, charging the final image of building with "broken weather."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from GPS failure to storm encounter to slide revelation to collaborative building, each layer deepening the stakes of passage and connection. The dominant stake—finding new ways to navigate when "markers vanish and compasses spin"—tightens as the narrator moves from solitary salvage to timewoven alliance. Cost registers in accepting perpetual learning over arrival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of scaffolding—joining disparate materials through patient craft rather than force. The slide's image of "hands...wrists bound by ribbons of years instead of rope" transforms binding from constraint to chosen alliance. The final insight that "journeys are scaffolds we become" reweights the entire navigation crisis as transformation rather than transit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency through craft-specific perception ("reads knots the way others read lines on palms") and maritime vocabulary. The controlled rhythm accelerates during the building sequence through shorter, action-focused sentences. Minor strain appears in abstract moments like "layered meanings click like mortises finding tenons in air" where metaphor reaches beyond the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in craft sequences where action reveals character and theme simultaneously. Some figurative density in peak moments ("scaffold complexity with simplicity" appears three times) creates mild redundancy. The phrase "layered meanings" recurs without sufficient variation, though it doesn't obscure the closure's clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide that projects "timewoven alliances" across generations offers a fresh take on connection and craft. The synthesis of maritime navigation, woodworking, and temporal alliance feels specific and earned. The transformation of a storm-damaged archway into "a threshold singing with patience" takes genuine risk with its lyric accumulation rather than causal plot.</comment>
