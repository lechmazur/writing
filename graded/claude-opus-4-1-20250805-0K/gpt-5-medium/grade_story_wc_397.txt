<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's transformation from seeking death to finding purpose through listening is earned through specific experiences (child rescue, Erland's mentorship). Internal contradiction plays out through the tension between scheduled appointment and growing commitment to the marina community. The final choice to delay again lands with visible cost - accepting continued uncertainty rather than the clean silence originally sought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through pattern of listening, rescue, and connection until the final image of "braided silence into patience, and patience into a way home" achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost - accepting ongoing vigilance over planned oblivion. The parasol tip transforms from heirloom fragment to diagnostic tool to salute, tracking the protagonist's evolution. Minor orientation wobble around "drift-ice marina" setting but recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The marina functions as active setting - ice that "bucked and threw a child," pontoons that groan, boats knocking "like knuckles." The parasol tip as micro-setting constrains choices (tapping for weakness, finding hollows during rescue). Sensory work is selective and POV-filtered: "Wind carried a hush that felt like windborne solace brushing ribs from within." Could push specificity of location/climate further but setting actively shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: arrival as death-seeker, transformation through storm, learning to listen, child rescue, storm preparation, final acceptance. The dominant stake (choosing life over scheduled death) tightens through each encounter that demonstrates value in "arriving before the moment buckles." Cost is visible in accepting uncertainty: "Home was not a door, but the sound of endings arriving and passing."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars - rope that "remembers where not to strain," endings that "shuffle like boots that forgot themselves." The concept of patience transforms from "queue toward oblivion" to "careful press against each creak." Final image of braided silence becoming "a way home" offers resonant answer to the death/life question without moralizing. "Living is just refusing an ending until it learns respect" crystallizes earned wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout - the protagonist notices through sound ("old vowels," "descending note," "spare laughter"). Lyric compression serves the accumulative mode: "My mind wakes now like a gull on a shifting rail." Dialogue between protagonist and Erland carries authentic subtext about mortality. Some filter-verb clustering ("I felt," "I breathed and thought") in middle sections prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong figurative precision: "Wind carried a hush that felt like windborne solace brushing ribs from within." Information density high - most lines advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Some template cadence runs ("I told him," "He said," "I say," "He laughs and says") and occasional paraphrase loops ("endings do not always clang; often they shuffle") create minor drag but don't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of euthanasia tourism with ice-rescue volunteer work creates non-obvious moral calculus. "Doctor Last-Minute" nickname, parasol tip as diagnostic tool, and "lexicon of edges" show specific invention. The transformation of patience from death-queue to life-practice offers genuine insight. Risk-taking in lyric/accumulative structure heightens resonance without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
