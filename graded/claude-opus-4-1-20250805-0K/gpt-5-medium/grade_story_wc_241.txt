<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's contradictory impulses—caution from watching her father's gambling versus her own attraction to unknowns—act simultaneously throughout, particularly in "I felt a tug, a lucid contradiction settling like a bird." The final choice to create a curriculum embracing "both stories" shows earned transformation with visible cost in accepting her father's flawed legacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as details accrue toward the resonant reconfiguration where she accepts contradictions as bridges rather than rifts. The closure lands with emotional cost ("grief smell green") and the bus scene crystallizes her changed stance. However, the middle section with the lantern discovery feels slightly convenient, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The library setting and rain create atmosphere that mirrors internal states ("clover melancholy"), and the candle lantern constrains her final choice by providing the theorem that reshapes her teaching approach. Spatial choreography through the stacks is clear, though some setting details remain ornamental rather than pressuring choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconciling her father's gambling legacy with her role as educator—escalates through discovering the subway coordinates, finding the lantern with its theorem, and culminates in her decision to teach "risk as stewardship." Cost is visible in accepting the contradiction rather than rejecting either side.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "lucid contradictions" that develops from gambling odds through teaching paradoxes to finally accepting bridges over rifts. The final bus scene offers a non-literal answer about public secrets and careful carrying forward that reweights all prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct academic voice with probability/gambling lexicon ("variance at the track," "Martingale," "Check your priors") maintains consistency while modulating appropriately during emotional peaks. The perceptual signature of seeing rain as "discrete coins" through mica demonstrates character-specific observation, though some passages edge toward over-literary register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but several instances of elevated diction strain credibility ("rainwashed," "clover melancholy," "queerly serifed"). Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple purposes, though phrases like "lucid contradictions" appear too frequently without sufficient variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of gambling father and probability professor daughter exploring contradiction as methodology feels fresh, particularly the subway seat coordinates as communication system. The transformation of betting slips into teaching theorems offers specificity, though the library discovery sequence follows somewhat predictable beats.</comment>
