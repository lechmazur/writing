I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through lyric accumulation and pattern rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's dance-as-language motivation is embodied through specific gestures that drive the liberation plot. The narrator's "tide remembering shore" establishes clear interior texture. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "vulnerability as strength" that could use more embodied grounding in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the "knot deciding it had been a bow all along" with liberation of trapped names achieved. Cost is visible in the drowned engineer's fate and the risk taken. Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by line 3. Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "liberated voices" crossing the web—the mechanism could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory setting directly constrains movement and communication methods throughout. "Silver fish stitched between consoles" and "flooded tiles" create vivid sensory specificity. The environment forces the dance-cipher solution and shapes every tactical choice, particularly how "the floor was the only page left to write on."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from initial infiltration through Warden Current's blue warning pulse to final liberation. The hangman's dice create meaningful pressure through their "hesitation as a number" mechanism. Cost is legible in the drowned engineer's backstory and the risk of triggering alarms, though the final liberation could show more immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the dance-as-resistance metaphor and "encrypt vulnerability as strength" without stating morals. The knot/bow transformation and "survivors learn to breathe differently" create resonant non-literal answers. The piece achieves complexity through its treatment of coded resistance and memory preservation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled compression: "Rust sighed in the beams" and "each step a syllable of a solution." POV remains consistent with selective perception focused on movement and water. The metaphorical density serves the accumulative mode without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "silver fish stitched between consoles like cursive annotations." Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("mysterious familiarity") that could be more concrete, though the lyric mode earns some allowance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underwater exploration with dance-as-cipher creates an original resistance narrative. The specific detail of "hangman's dice" with "edges worn smooth as rib bones" shows genuine invention. The transformation of imprisonment into liberation through choreographed code is non-obvious and earned.</comment>
