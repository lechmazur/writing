<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal contradiction between persistence and measurement creates authentic tension throughout. The final acceptance of "boundless confinement" with "everything finally in place" represents earned stasis with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract philosophical passages that occasionally drift from embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with mathematical proofs accumulating toward a resonant reconfiguration where "perpetual motion is a story told by finite muscles." The closure transforms climbing from escape-seeking to "shaping the corridor into a remembering instrument" with clear cost. Orientation anchors (staircase, dice, missed opportunity) establish early and pay off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The staircase functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—"boundless confinement of a maze with a single corridor." The chipped dice and chalk that "refuses to wear down" create tactile specificity. The "silver crack" and its transformation to "thin luminous seam" charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through mathematical proofs that gradually reveal the engine's nature: "regret" powers it, "patience" lubricates it. The crucial turn—stopping seeking exit to shape the corridor—forecloses escape with visible cost. The dice stopping "impossibly on edge" crystallizes the balance between damage and fairness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mathematical proof metaphor: "A theorem must admit the scar that birthed it." The ending reweights climbing as remembering rather than arriving, with the crack remaining as "window and scar, precisely remembered." No explicit moralizing; the resolution embraces paradox.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends mathematical precision ("lemmas," "corollaries," "constants") with lyrical compression ("breath on a mirror that never clears"). The perceptual signature—seeing opportunities as "apertures" and missed chances as "texture"—remains consistent. Rhythmic control heightens without sacrificing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "I am a grim optimist, balancedly daring" establishes character while echoing the required attribute. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful repetition ("proof," "proves," "proving") that accumulates meaning. Minor deduction for occasional abstract passages that slightly slow momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mathematical proof metaphor for processing regret is fresh and specific. The image of dice "holding each other like a shoulder" transforms a simple object into emotional resonance. The concept of an infinite staircase powered by regret creates a non-obvious synthesis of elements.</comment>
