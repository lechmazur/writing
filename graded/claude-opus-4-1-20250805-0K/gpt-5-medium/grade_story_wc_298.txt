I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through lyric density and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal chains, with closure achieved through resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "patch holes in the soul that grief had chewed" drives consistent choices through concrete actions—trading destinies, planting listening seeds. Internal contradiction plays out between reckless idealism and "fiercely gentle" patience. The boy's transformation from soldier to scholar lands with visible relief ("shoulders fell like a cliff relieved of scaffolding"), though his characterization remains somewhat thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the planting of "listening seeds" that reweight the narrator's role from destiny-trader to tender of meaning, with cost paid through scattering grandmother's stories. The accumulative structure coheres through recurring images (ash, bones, roots) that charge the final stance. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. Minor deduction for cost visibility—while conceptually present, the emotional price could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard functions as active setting—roots snake between bones that "chimed whenever a breeze lost its way," creating atmosphere that shapes choices. The bone-hand pit becomes the crucial space for transformation. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("air tasted of candle soot," "brass light pooled like thin honey"). The environment constrains action and enables the final planting that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on transforming destinies that don't fit—the boy's "iron shoes" soldier-future that must be traded. Escalation occurs through accumulation: finding the Weaver, discovering the boy, performing the trade, paying the debt. Cost materializes when the narrator must scatter grandmother's stories as payment. The pressure coheres under the textural lens but lacks a sharp reversal or heightened opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concept of "inlaying meaning everywhere" as active practice rather than decoration—"not to decorate, but to remind the dark it was seen." The transformation of destinies explores how futures can be bartered but require sacrifice. The final image of planting "seeds of listening" offers a non-literal answer about growth through borrowed wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive texture through inventive metaphors ("palimpsest of old deals," "roots snaked between bones") and controlled rhythm. POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature—the narrator notices through lens of kindness and repair. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("Your card has teeth, but it wants a tongue"). Minor convergence in emotional registers between narrator and Weaver.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The pit held a boy with cindery eyes, humming to the bone-hand as if it were a trapped bird" establishes location, character, and emotional state simultaneously. Some figurative density borders on overwriting ("palimpsest of old deals, inlaying meaning everywhere the shadows dared to rest") but serves the lyric mode. Clean grammar and varied syntax throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The bartered destinies concept offers fresh angle on fate-trading, made specific through the underground market's mechanics and the grandmother's burned tarot card. The image of planting listening seeds as payment transforms expected transaction. Some elements feel familiar (magical market, wise crone figure) but the synthesis through "fiercely gentle" kindness and the specific resolution elevate beyond template.</comment>
