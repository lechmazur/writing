<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict between preservation duty and desire for change drives meaningful choices, particularly the midnight decision to release the letter through dormant networks. The "bravely conflicted" attribute manifests in concrete hesitation rituals and the final ambiguous stance on whether preservation or freedom was achieved. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional states ("dizzying quiet," "starving for escape") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—the city "woke strangely rested" with subtle behavioral changes rather than revolution. The letter's release through dormant networks creates visible cost (the archivist's uncertain future) and reweights the opening's "breathless echoes" into active punctuation. Orientation anchors (library, archivist role, frozen stacks) establish cleanly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen library setting with its hissing pipes and frost-furred brass creates atmospheric pressure that mirrors the protagonist's preservation dilemma. The dormant conduits beneath stones become essential infrastructure for the story's resolution. Setting constrains choice effectively—the midnight power grid reset provides the crucial window for action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity about a quarantined letter to risking professional future by releasing city-changing information. The midnight timing creates genuine pressure with the power grid's "failed revolution" providing the decisive moment. Cost is visible in the protagonist's potential future loss ("melt the disciplined ice of my trade") and the irreversible nature of the action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the letter's content—"maintenance as courtship" and "love as the refusal to let things fail unseen"—without explicit moralizing. The final image of the library holding its breath with the narrator resonantly reweights the opening's "breathless echoes." The story explores preservation versus change through concrete action rather than abstract philosophy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines technical archival language ("cryogenic archivist," "quarantined for three regimes") with poetic compression ("snow cooks silence differently"). POV remains consistently close-third with controlled psychic distance. The lyric mode's purposeful compression serves the accumulative structure, though occasional abstractions ("dizzying quiet") slightly reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"pipes hissed beneath the aisles where frost furred the brass like patient moss" combines setting, atmosphere, and the preservation theme. Some abstract phrasing ("bravely conflicted," "starving for escape") and occasional register elevation in peak moments reduce clarity. No significant loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of love letters as infrastructure documentation ("desire mapped in cables") offers fresh synthesis of romance and rebellion. The dormant network activation method and the subtle city transformation through "tiny decisions" rather than revolution shows original thinking. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens meaning without sacrificing clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>
