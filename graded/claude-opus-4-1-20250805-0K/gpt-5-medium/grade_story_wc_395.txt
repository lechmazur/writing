I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through pattern accumulation (recurring numbers, deleted files, echoes) toward a resonant reconfiguration where Aida's voice returns through the narrator's choice.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to pursue truth despite job risk is earned through accumulated detail, and the final choice between alerting legal or surfacing files carries visible professional cost. Internal conflict between duty and justice plays out through concrete actions (lying to the access bot, following the breadcrumb trail). Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("sensed absence") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator chooses voice over safety, with Aida's return ("Still here, still counting") confirming the cost was worth paying. The accumulative pattern of numbers/deletions coheres meaningfully, and orientation anchors clearly (corporate memory keeper at Remnant). The drive lens holds throughout with pattern-teaching early and payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archive setting constrains choices through access protocols and the Sink's lyric challenge, while sensory details ("cold air smelled like old servers") ground abstraction. The mission patch functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Deduction for some generic corporate spaces that could be more distinctive to this particular archive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional curiosity to job-risking truth-telling, with the dominant stake (finding where deleted files go) tightening through discovered threats and doxxing. The narrator's lie to the access bot and final choice to post publicly show agency foreclosing the safe path. Cost is visible in risking "my job and the hush."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of deleted files as disappeared people, with the final image of routing "the stream across forgotten songs toward memory" offering a non-literal answer about preservation versus erasure. The mission patch recurrence and number patterns create resonance without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical register ("archivists sweeping a beach at night," "flashlight everyone forgets"). Perceptual signature shows in how the narrator notices patterns others dismiss. Minor deduction for occasional drift toward corporate abstraction ("policy cliffs") that slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in weaving the number pattern through different contexts. Some figurative density in places ("sensed absence," "shaped like a missing person") creates minor opacity. No significant loops or scaffolding, though a few abstract phrases could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital archaeology with missing persons investigation creates an unexpected angle on memory and deletion. The specific detail of Flight 7421's telemetry becoming a breadcrumb trail shows inventive transformation of the disaster. The corporate archive as site of both erasure and preservation offers non-obvious complexity.</comment>
