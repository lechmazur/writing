I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causality, with density increasing toward a resonant reconfiguration where the undertaker creates a permanent address system for the dead.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The undertaker's motivation to give rest "a permanent address" drives consistent choices through embodied exhaustion ("weary," "waterlogged names") and contradiction between professional duty and deeper calling. The character's "inadvertently stubborn" trait manifests in refusing to stop aligning shards despite warnings, with visible cost in the final transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the undertaker transforms the library into a permanent registry for the dead, with clear cost ("grief taught me to lift what the living cannot carry"). The accumulative lens holds as density builds through catalog cards, signal codes, and the final SOR pattern that "knits a harbor where nothing must depart."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The underwater library setting actively constrains choices through "water thin as breath, held back by tired barriers" and enables the solution via bioluminescent vents. Spatial choreography from harbor to service well to library aisles remains coherent, with the environment charging the final image of "a patient registry open for arrivals and last words."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal weariness through the lens's demand to the mantled thing's patient threat ("patience is how the sea kills"). The undertaker's agency drives the resolution through arranging shards and assigning coordinates, with visible cost in choosing to remain below as permanent keeper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: rest as location rather than surrender, distress signals transformed from panic to permission. The final SOR code ("stay or rest") resonantly answers the central question without moralizing, reweighting the opening's "waterlogged names" into ordered addresses.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "I measure days by the weight of names," "chased stillness breathing behind me." Voice maintains lyric compression under pressure without losing clarity, with purposeful elision ("inadvertently stubborn in the way a tide forgets how to reverse") that pays off in the transformation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The city sits three streets below the harbor, a skeleton of boulevards sealed in glass domes and regret"). Some metaphor density in peak beats ("chased stillness," "mantled thing") but pattern-taught and coherent. Minor scaffold in "I realize" construction but momentum remains strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker-as-librarian creating forwarding addresses for the dead, with the underwater library as afterlife registry. The SOS-to-SOR transformation and "chased stillness" as entity show genuine ingenuity that feels earned through accumulated particulars.</comment>
