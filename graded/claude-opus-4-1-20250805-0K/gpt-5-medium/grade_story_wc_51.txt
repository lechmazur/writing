<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "collect the weights of different burdens" drives concrete micro-choices throughout (lifting each burden, orienting properly, recording in ledger), with the final self-confrontation earning its cost through prior pattern. Internal conflict manifests physically when the narrator becomes "boundary-lessly trapped" before the Weaver's touch enables reorientation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through burden-lifting repetitions until the narrator's own "unadmitted burden" forces a Resonant Reconfiguration where fear finds "a shelf where it could stand without gnawing"—cost visible in the physical struggle and acceptance of duty. The bronze grotto setting anchors early (by line 2) and the pattern of weighing/orienting teaches its logic through action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bronze grotto's "whalebone" acoustics and kerosene lamp's "modest coin" of light constrain the weighing ritual to intimate gestures, while the "shingled hush" of the city above creates pressure through contrast. Setting directly enables the final transformation when morning birds "shook the roofs" and the hush "became song."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from external burdens (widow memory, soldier name) to the narrator's own fear that "love would demand my departure," with each weighing teaching new grammar of heaviness. The final self-confrontation where the narrator becomes "boundary-lessly trapped" before finding balance shows clear cost, though middle burdens could pressure tactics more directly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of weighing grief—each burden revealing how "pain stacks or slides" depending on orientation, culminating in the insight that burdens need "to know, to honor how each load wants to rest." The final image of carrying the ledger "into thawing streets" resonantly answers the opening's snowmelt without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice maintains "bronze grotto under starlight" register throughout with controlled metaphoric density ("coins discussing the afterlife of pockets," "shingled hush...like scales on a dreaming fish"). The Weaver's sparse dialogue carries subtext about patience and orientation while the narrator's perceptual signature filters everything through weight and texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong figurative control with purposeful images that advance meaning ("cave breathed like a whale skeleton," "threads thinner than frost, each dyed with a different hush"), though occasional abstraction creeps in ("boundary-lessly trapped in unfinished orders"). Information density high—most lines do double work of atmosphere and progression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of physically weighing emotional burdens through magical reorientation offers a fresh angle on grief work, with specific innovations like burdens hanging "from a quiet" and the "shingled hush" determining how pain stacks. The Fractal Weaver as guide who threads patterns through "drips, starlight, and...breath" avoids mentor clichés through concrete mysticism.</comment>
