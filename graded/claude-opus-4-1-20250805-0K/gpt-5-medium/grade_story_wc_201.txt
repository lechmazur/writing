I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered sensory details and metaphorical density toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's embodied trauma responses and proprioceptive enhancement create authentic interiority, with contradictory impulses (seeking mercy while carrying violence) acting simultaneously. The final choice to leave "a geometry anyone can feel" shows earned transformation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract moments ("mathematics of mercy") that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist transforms from instrument to "wood again," with the pewter strap marking a boundary and the forest internalized. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward this reconfiguration. Cost is visible in the "wall the function cannot cross" and the commitment to carry this knowledge to others still "turning screws."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest functions as both setting and moral architecture, with trees that "burn in a light my skin cannot name" constraining perception and forcing honesty. The pewter strap becomes a physical boundary marker. Environment directly shapes the protagonist's mathematical revelation about mercy's margins.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative pressure as the forest's equations intensify from "faint" to demanding "honesty from the body," culminating in the protagonist composing a theorem with the environment. The cost manifests in accepting to be "wood again" rather than instrument, foreclosing the path of detachment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the body's knowledge of "angles where pain changes flavor," avoiding abstraction. The final image of carrying "a forest inside me that refuses to be silent" resonantly answers the question of how perpetrators might find redemption through embodied understanding rather than intellectual apology.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—"ultraviolet forest hums with a color that does not exist"—with consistent lyric compression. The proprioceptive awareness creates a unique filtering system. Voice maintains poetic density without sacrificing clarity at crucial moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("trees answer with a chorus of faint equations"), but some abstract phrases weaken momentum ("mathematics of mercy," "algorithm demands honesty"). Occasional redundancy in conceptual territory. The lyric mode mostly succeeds but occasionally drifts toward opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of enhanced interrogation survivor seeking redemption through synesthetic forest mathematics is genuinely fresh. The proprioceptive enhancement as both gift and burden offers non-obvious complexity. Risk-taking in the lyric mode and conceptual density heightens rather than obscures the moral stakes.</comment>
