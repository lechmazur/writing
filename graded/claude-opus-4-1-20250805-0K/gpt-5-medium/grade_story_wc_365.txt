I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through sensory mapping, parallel universe weaving, and pattern recognition toward a resonant reconfiguration where the narrator accepts responsibility for a childhood action that redirected fate.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation crystallizes through embodied details—the shard "ticking against the pulse of my ribs," mapping scents as doorways between worlds. The revelation that the child-self pressed REDIRECT lands with earned weight, and the final choice to "fold her into the chart" rather than forgive or blame shows mature complexity. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("cyclically spontaneous, obedient to rhythms") that briefly obscures embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator discovers they redirected the evacuation as a child, accepts this truth's weight, and transforms it into "routes others can survive." The cost is palpable—mother's protective silence, the weight "heavy metal and rain," and the responsibility of mapping paths for survivors. The accumulative structure coheres through sensory anchoring and parallel universe mechanics that pay off in the revelation sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The repair bay functions as both physical space and memory vessel, with chains that echo as snakes across universes and terminals that hold photologs. Sensory hierarchy reflects the mapper's profession—"every surface smelled of ozone and rain," scents as dimensional doorways. The green shard serves as micro-setting, refracting emotion and focusing residual data, though some spatial choreography remains abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking a withheld truth to discovering personal culpability in the failed evacuation. The pressure tightens through parallel universe revelations—"Engineers shouted in one, whispered in another"—building to the child's hand hovering over destiny. The cost manifests in accepting responsibility for redirected lives and deaths, though the middle section could sharpen the pressure between discovery attempts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of redirecting—fuel, destiny, breath, memory—without moralizing. The final image of redirecting the lost "one heartbeat per world" resonates with the opening's sensory mapping, suggesting how we navigate trauma through transformation rather than erasure. The line "a map that lies becomes only decoration for ruins" crystallizes the theme of truthful witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice weaves lyric compression with technical precision: "I splice coordinates through parallel universes and step without closing my eyes." The perceptual signature—experiencing reality through scent gradients and pressure differentials—remains consistent. Rhythm modulates effectively from meditative opening to the staccato revelation sequence, though occasional abstract phrases ("cyclically spontaneous") slightly muddy the texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs—"The shard remembers the color of alarms, a planetary aurora poured into cheap tempered glass." Some repetitive phrasing appears ("redirect" variations, though thematically justified) and abstract constructions like "obedient to rhythms that reappear unbidden" occasionally slow momentum. The prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity in the revelation sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory mapping, parallel universe navigation, and childhood trauma investigation feels fresh and inevitable. The specific detail of smell as dimensional anchor ("Each universe agrees on smell before arguing about color") and the mapper's professional lens on personal tragedy create genuine originality. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and non-linear revelation heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
