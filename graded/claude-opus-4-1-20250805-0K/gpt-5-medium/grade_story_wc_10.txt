I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered sensory details and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist's translation system transforms silence into communal meaning.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to translate silence into visible music is grounded in the capsizing trauma and father's lost choir. Internal conflict between grief and the need to continue is embodied through physical gestures and the heat-mapping system. The final choice to continue despite absence of sound shows earned endurance with visible communal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when "We are unshaken marvels ourselves, proof that even a capsized world can learn to balance." The accumulative lens holds as sensory patterns build toward this crystallized understanding. Cost is visible in the community's need for translation and the protagonist's tireless work in "brittle cold."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory functions as both setting and instrument, its frost patterns becoming the canvas for emotional translation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "ice-limned ferns arch under glass ribs." The environment directly constrains choice through temperature gradients that must be carefully calibrated to avoid "lilies blistered in sympathy."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating meaning without sound—escalates through the protagonist's refinement of the heat-mapping system after initial failure. Pressure coheres as the crowd gathers with specific needs (the weeping man, the signing girl). The deepening from failed first attempt to successful performance narrows options and forces precise calibration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of translation without sound, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of carrying the case "like a lantern" while the city "glows in reciprocal quiet" offers a non-literal answer about finding meaning after catastrophic loss. Subtext operates through the tuning forks' silent intervals that "still measure distances my heart insists on crossing."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric precision with distinctive perceptual signature: "noise becomes impossible" creates a haunting refrain. Syntax mirrors the protagonist's careful calibration work through measured, technical observations. The POV's selective attention to temperature, light, and gesture reflects their translator role without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The forks themselves are inert now, their teeth like antlers caught perpetually before the strike." Some minor repetition of "unshaken marvels" and occasional abstract phrasing ("nation of wrong readings") slightly dulls momentum but doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise of a world where "noise becomes impossible" transforms the familiar concert hall into something genuinely fresh. The heat-mapping emotional translation system is inventive and follows its implications fully. Risk-taking in the lyric, fragmented structure heightens meaning while maintaining clarity at closure.</comment>
