<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Oris's motivation to "welcome nuance into a certainty" drives consistent micro-choices through threading the ampoule and bridging scholar/city perspectives. The internal tension between revealing truth incrementally versus completely creates genuine stakes. Embodied details like "stone knees stirring anemones" ground the abstract meditation. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("incisively kind") that occasionally replaces concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with cascading revelations building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the ampoule's true nature (memory/tempo, not poison) reweights the entire civic drowning. Cost is legible in "We had not lied; we had told one rung on a ladder of truths." The threading action creates causal linkage between revelation and understanding. Slight opacity in the exact nature of the underwater setting's relationship to the "above" world prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater garden setting actively constrains choices—telepathy travels through water, the dome's structural weakness becomes the entry point, barnacles must be negotiated. Vivid sensory details like "foxglove-stained glass" and "anemones that wrote their astonishment in bubbles" create atmosphere. The setting doesn't quite reach the 9-band because some spatial relationships remain vague (exact position of scholar "above").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through deepening understanding: secret revealed → ampoule's true nature discovered → threading through breach → scholar's certainty reopening. The dominant stake of bridging certainty/nuance tightens as Oris must act despite the scholar's resistance. Cost appears in the scholar's "recoil" and eventual acceptance requiring patience "longer than certainty likes." Agency drives each revelation through Oris's deliberate choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the central metaphor of the ampoule teaching "minds to pause before they decided"—hesitation as wisdom, not cowardice. The recurring "incisively kind" and "structural weakness" motifs gain meaning through action. The final image of setting "benches for arguments yet to bloom" offers a non-literal answer about productive uncertainty. Strong integration without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and inventive constructions like "animate lifeless and oddly tender." The telepathic POV justifies access to the scholar's reactions. Some register elevation ("cascading revelations upon revelations") occasionally drifts from the established voice. The perceptual signature of a thinking statue seeing through water currents is consistent and original.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, repetitive use of "cascading revelations" (appears 4 times) creates a loop. Some abstract constructions like "incisively kind" appear multiple times without variation. The "structural weakness" phrase also repeats mechanically. These patterns prevent entry to higher bands despite strong foundational craft.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of an underwater statue mediating between drowned city and living scholar is fresh. The transformation of poison into memory/tempo shows genuine ingenuity. The specific synthesis of patience-as-strategy through the foxglove metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the experimental voice and structure heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
