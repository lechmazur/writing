I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, analyzing each category for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through layered imagery (maps/potential, ants/paths, water/time) building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at the cavern where choice crystallizes.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's contradictory impulses between stillness and movement play out through concrete actions (following ants, pressing the chip, crossing water). The final choice to "travel by choosing, one decision at a time" is earned through accumulated pressure, though "empirically intuitive" edges toward diagnostic language in places.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the doorway doesn't choose but "stopped time long enough to notice," with visible cost in leaving the door's ease behind. The accumulative structure coheres through ant-paths, water-rising, and promise-transformation, though orientation could anchor slightly earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cavern's "blooming...impossible and exact in its geometry" constrains choice effectively, and the creek's rising water creates genuine urgency. Setting details like "barbed light" and "pinyon and typesmoke" are specific and atmospheric, though some descriptions lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through water pressure ("creek climbing the banks so persistently that the air tasted electric") forcing the decision moment. The choice to remove the chip "because leaving it would make the door too easy" shows agency with clear cost—foreclosing the easier path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through "sells potential to people who prefer it to place" and culminates in understanding that promises are "built from small, repeated choices." The final image of the chip as compass reweights the entire journey without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm ("elevation lines curl like sleeping cats") and effective modulation under pressure. The perceptual signature of noticing geography in everything is consistent, though occasional phrases like "empirically intuitive wisdom in my knees" strain slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("shining black commas on pale stones"), but some redundancy exists ("I felt the promise pull tight"/"Ruth used to say promises linger"). Information density is high in most beats, though a few passages could tighten further.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of map-dealing/potential-selling with ant-following as navigation method feels fresh and inevitable. The risk of leaving the story's resolution deliberately difficult ("leaving it would make the door too easy") elevates the piece beyond safety.</comment>
