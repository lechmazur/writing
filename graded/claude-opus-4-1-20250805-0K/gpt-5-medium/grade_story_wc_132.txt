<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's transformation from controlling to releasing unfolds through embodied moments like "felt the old question uncoil" and "small unfixing in her chest," with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (the urge to fix vs. letting go). The final choice to "learn to take apart my certainty" is earned through accumulated moments of plants defying her arrangements, though some interiority edges toward mild abstraction ("circuitously sincere").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through pattern breaks—from tying knots that "sighed loose" to finding jasmine "braided itself with the hop"—culminating in Mara's vow to reconstruct "only what grows kinder" with clear cost (surrendering control). The orientation anchors cleanly (plant nursery, storm season, Mara) and the Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt price as she commits to daily attention over command.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nursery setting actively constrains choices—storms force rearrangement, the "mossy trellis after rain" provides shelter for revelation, and specific plants (ivy, jasmine, linden) demand particular placements that teach Mara. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("air heavy," "soil bright with possibilities"), though some moments could be more tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to control or release—escalates through accumulating evidence: knots untying, plants choosing their own spots, culminating in the public speech where Mara risks vulnerability. Cost is visible in her "reluctant metamorphosis" and the forfeiture of her arranging habits, with pressure cohering under the Accumulative lens as each observation deepens her transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars—the linden leaf as "map of untraveled roads," plants "working out their own calculus"—without stating morals explicitly. The final image of keeping "listening until the garden could hear itself through her" offers a resonant, non-literal answer about care as subtraction, though one line edges toward thematic echo ("care can be a subtraction that leaves more life").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shows in Mara's plant-focused attention and metaphorical thinking ("rain tells truth slowly," "vines to choose the sky"). Voice maintains consistency through modulated registers—internal reflection, dialogue with customers, public speech—though some phrases like "reluctant metamorphosis" feel slightly elevated for the established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between reflection and action. Some mild redundancy appears ("circuitously sincere" used twice identically) and occasional abstract phrasing ("old question uncoil"), but information density remains high with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in descriptive passages that advance both setting and emotional state.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise of a plant nursery owner learning to release control through storm season offers a fresh angle on transformation narratives, with specific details like plants "leaning toward thunder" avoiding generic treatment. The synthesis feels earned though not groundbreaking; the story commits to its premise without retreat but doesn't risk unconventional structural choices.</comment>
