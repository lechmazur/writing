I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered sensory details and metaphorical density toward a resonant reconfiguration where naming transforms anonymity.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to recover lost names through translating between worlds is consistent and embodied through concrete actions with the lens fragment. The final choice to name the child shows clear agency with visible cost (the painting becomes "unsellable" yet gains truth). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "anchors of intuition" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds through market description, lens revelation, and painting examination to reach a Resonant Reconfiguration where naming the child transforms the painting from drowning in anonymity to gaining substance. The cost is visible ("the price of the dusk became irrelevant") and the accumulative lens holds throughout. Slight deduction for the abstract "eternal instant" concept that doesn't fully integrate with the concrete naming action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The alchemist's market setting directly constrains and enables the central action—rope bridges, glass chimes, and weathered awnings create a liminal space where translation occurs. The lighthouse lens fragment functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when pressed to canvas. Exceptional integration of sensory details (tar of wharves, iron of buckets) that emerge through the lens to guide the naming.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of recovering overlooked histories escalates through the lens revealing the painting's hidden layers, though agency remains primarily observational until the naming act. The cost manifests when the painting's commercial value becomes "irrelevant" after naming. Would benefit from more active resistance or complication in the middle section rather than smooth revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of recovering a child's name from a painting, avoiding abstract statements about memory or history. The final image of the painter tying the name to the frame offers a non-literal answer about how forgotten lives persist in art's margins. Strong subtext in "unsellable, which is to say, most true."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends lyrical compression ("dried thunder, ferments of moonlight") with precise sensory notation. The perceptual signature of translating "what skylines say to shadows" remains consistent throughout. Excellent control of psychic distance, moving from market overview to intimate lens work. Minor repetition of "eternal instant" concept slightly dulls impact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("unsellable, which is to say, most true"). Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, though some abstract phrasing ("anchors of intuition," "eternal instant") creates minor opacity. The prose accelerates appropriately during the lens revelation sequence. No significant loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of a translator who reads histories through paintings and lens fragments offers fresh specificity. The transformation of "unsellable" into "most true" provides an original take on value systems. The specific sensory coordinates (tar, iron, nets) as a form of naming avoids generic abstraction.</comment>
