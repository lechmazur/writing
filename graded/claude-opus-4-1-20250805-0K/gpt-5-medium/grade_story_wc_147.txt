I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through lyric density and sensory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the narrator succeeds in sending the distress signal through the temple's acoustic properties.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like swimming with the transmitter and navigating the narrowing corridor. The twice-repeated "overriding instinct" shows internal contradiction acting in scene, with visible cost in the gauge needles warning and depth's weight. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("lonesome splendor") that doesn't fully embody the emotional state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the signal successfully transmits through the temple's acoustics, with visible cost in depleting air and the narrator's fear ("proud and afraid"). The accumulative structure coheres as sensory details build toward the transmission moment. Slight deduction for mild orientation delay - the rescue mission context emerges gradually rather than anchoring immediately.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The underwater temple setting actively constrains choices through narrowing corridors that "scrape my tank" and the acoustic properties that enable the solution. Vivid sensory work: "anemones that blink like patient eyes," "silt swallows my lamp into a bruise of brown." The environment directly shapes tactics and charges the final image of "the temple fading behind me like a star at noon."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through depleting air ("gauge needles inch toward warning"), physical pressure ("stone teeth scrape my tank"), and the tightening choice between panic and stillness. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through deliberate actions. Cost is visible but could be sharper - the "proud and afraid" ending acknowledges risk without fully dramatizing the price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the perfume vial's ability to "touch memories" and carry "what refuses to be held," creating resonance about ephemeral connection and rescue from absence. The final image of the vial as "a small bell of collected silence" reweights earlier material without stating a moral. Strong integration of concrete and abstract through sensory detail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "cathedral of pressure and blue," "ribboning inward with a tired, regal pace." The voice maintains poetic compression while remaining comprehensible, with purposeful elision that serves the underwater setting's dreamlike quality. Rhythm modulates effectively under pressure, shortening during panic moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The sea around the trench spread in lonesome splendor, a cathedral of pressure and blue that swallowed the lights of my skiff." Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("lonesome splendor," "ephemeral") but mostly serves the lyric mode. Minor redundancy in describing the vial's properties across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underwater rescue with synesthetic memory transmission through the perfume vial creates an original angle. The specific detail of using a crystal vial's acoustic properties to amplify emergency signals shows genuine ingenuity. The piece commits to its lyric-technical hybrid without retreat, though some metaphors edge toward the familiar.</comment>
