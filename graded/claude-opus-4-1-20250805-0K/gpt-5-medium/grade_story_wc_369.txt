I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "deconstruct grief" through quantifying dream dust shows compelling specificity, with embodied details like sweeping dust into hills and measuring with a teaspoon. The final choice to label the dust as "minutes yet unread" demonstrates earned transformation through accumulated discovery. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("time was a tool we barely deserved") that edges toward philosophy without full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through dream dust measurement, sextant healing, and tree witnessing that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist can "finally hear the register of their quiet." The discovery of archived tags and their translation creates genuine transformation with visible cost (the labyrinth's years of accumulated sorrow). Orientation anchors (tower, labyrinth worker, night) establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stormlit tower and labyrinth function as active participants—the maze "sighed like a sleeping boiler" and later "coughed in the rain," while the tower "breathed and locked the air into a vault." The discovered room that "breathed like a sleeping dog" and the root breaching the wall constrain choices and enable discovery. Setting directly shapes the closure through environmental responsiveness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: from maintaining the labyrinth to quantifying sorrow to discovering the trees' archived witness. The pin dropping creates a decisive turn that leads to excavation and discovery. Cost manifests in "measured grief will float if you let it"—the protagonist must accept accumulated sorrow to achieve understanding, though the emotional price could be more viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete practice of measuring dream dust and discovering archived witness—"mundane miracles arrive with schedules and clipboards." The final image of trees gleaming "as if just rained" and hearing "the register of their quiet" offers resonant closure without stating a moral. The integration of quantified sorrow with tree witnessing creates layered meaning about grief's measurability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines technical precision ("hinge, latch, and hidden wheel") with lyrical perception ("the night was a welder of edges"). The perceptual signature shows consistent selectivity—noticing mechanical details, measuring grief, reading angles. Syntax modulates effectively, from longer contemplative sentences to the sharp "It happened at the moment a pin is heard.'"</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The labyrinth hummed as the maps formed, and the tower stopped leaking in every place I had not yet fixed" advances plot while embodying transformation. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph breaks. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("time was a tool we barely deserved") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of maintenance work with grief quantification through dream dust measurement shows genuine originality—"my first experiment in quantified sorrow." The discovery that trees archive witness and the labyrinth stores their minutes transforms familiar elements. Risk-taking in the lyrical-technical fusion heightens meaning (+0.3 within band for coherent unconventional choices).</comment>
