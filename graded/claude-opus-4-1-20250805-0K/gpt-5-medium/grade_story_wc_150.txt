I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered images and returns, with density increases and pattern breaks that reweight meaning, particularly through the sundial restoration sequence.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to restore faith through archaeological work is clear and embodied through concrete actions like arranging bones "like notes in a hymn." Internal contradiction between diaspora displacement and homecoming desire creates authentic tension. The final choice to stay and tend trees shows earned transformation with visible cost (abandoning return journey).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the narrator's decision to remain, with visible cost of foreclosing the diaspora return. The accumulative lens holds as images (sundial, bones, orchard) layer and reweight through the restoration sequence. The final orbit "that kept the orchard speaking and my journey unbroken" crystallizes the reconfigured stance with clear before/after legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard setting directly constrains choices - roots braided with skulls dictate excavation methods, the missing gnomon requires creative restoration. Sensory detail like "small wind that smelled of leaves and turned pages" filters through POV priorities. The sundial's restoration enables the final ritual orbit, making setting essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on faith restoration through physical excavation work, with escalation through the sundial discovery and restoration sequence. The gnomon's creation from "a rib of pomegranate wood" represents agency transforming interrupted journeys. Cost is visible when "a hinge gave way in my chest" and the final commitment to stay rather than continue wandering.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of interrupted journeys emerges through concrete particulars - the caravan guide's halted path, the diaspora narrator's return, the sundial missing its gnomon. The final image of circular orbiting "that kept the orchard speaking and my journey unbroken" offers resonant answer without stating moral. Subtext operates through actions like returning objects to "places that made sense."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through selective noticing ("time hesitate like a held breath," "starlings circled like punctuation"). Lyric compression serves the accumulative mode, though some passages edge toward over-writing ("the earth was speaking a dialect I almost remembered"). Dialogue with Sami feels natural and advances the restoration plot through collaboration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, but figurative density in places like "catacomb orchard answered with a small wind" and "shadow kissed the numeral for home" accumulates without always advancing pressure. Some template phrasing appears ("I told Sami," "He asked," "I said"). The piece maintains momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of archaeology, faith restoration, and diaspora return through the specific image of rebuilding a sundial in a catacomb orchard feels fresh and non-obvious. The conceptual linkage between interrupted journeys and archaeological excavation transforms familiar material. Risk-taking through lyric accumulation and the quiet ending of orbital tending serves the piece's meditative aims.</comment>
