<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal contradiction between professional distance and emotional pull drives genuine tension, particularly in handling the speaker grille cloth. The final choice to assign memorial value over market price shows earned character movement with visible professional cost. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("grief kept finding the gap") rather than fully embodied states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the narrator moves from insulating with facts to allowing memory its value, with professional risk as legible cost. The piece teaches its pattern of applause/echo/memory early and pays it off through the final valuation decision. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the quarry setting's relationship to past concerts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quarry as "echo valley" constrains choices effectively—its acoustic memory forces the confrontation with Leon's death. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("rock dust frosting my boots like evaporated applause"). The speaker grille cloth functions as micro-setting that charges the final image, though some descriptions lean abstract ("rusted thought").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from professional distance to physical handling of the scrap to the final valuation that risks credibility. The dominant stake—maintaining emotional insulation versus honoring memory—tightens when the narrator must price the unpriceable. Cost is visible in the professional risk taken ("recommend museum placement").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between facts as "handles that would not snap" and memory's insistence on naming itself. The final valuation ("memory load disproportionate to market") offers a non-literal answer to how we price loss. The applause motif accumulates meaning from performance to death to silence to echo, charging the closure without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in technical appraisal language mixed with musical memory ("coil hope onto spindles"). Voice maintains consistency through emotional pressure, though some metaphors strain ("quarry office trailer squatted in the cut like a rusted thought"). No dialogue to evaluate, which fits the isolated confrontation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though several abstract metaphors reduce clarity ("grief kept finding the gap between stories and sleep"). Some figurative density in non-pressure moments ("windows clouded, heater ticking, echoes of blasts already asleep") without clear payoff. Information density is high, with most lines advancing both external cataloging and internal reckoning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of antiques appraisal with rock venue memory creates non-obvious emotional territory. The specific detail of cigarette placement on speaker grille and the quarry's acoustic memory avoid generic grief narrative. The professional vocabulary of valuation applied to personal loss ("memory load disproportionate to market") offers genuine originality.</comment>
