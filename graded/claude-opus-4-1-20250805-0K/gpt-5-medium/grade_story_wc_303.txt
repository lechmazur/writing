<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ilya's internal conflict between preserving the violin for payment versus letting it choose its own end creates genuine tension with embodied details like "mulberry ache of decision bruise his ribs." The character's telepathic connection with plants provides unique interiority that shapes his final choice. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("perforated destiny tearing along dotted seams") that occasionally replaces concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change closure where Ilya plays the violin, letting it dissolve rather than preserving it for the museum, with visible cost (losing payment, defying empire). The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout with pattern breaks and density increases building to the dissolution. Orientation anchors (observatory, midsummer, noon deadline) establish stakes early and the "promise to keep" throughline maintains causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The velvet observatory and ice violin constrain choices effectively—the heat threatens melting, the dome shapes sound propagation. Sensory details like "velvet eating the sharp edges until only ache remained" serve the POV's musical perception. The coffee stains as "peasant astronomy" and ferns' telepathic warnings create lived-in specificity that shapes tactical decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulating pressure: noon deadline, empire's claim versus the dream, the violin's physical melting under heat. The final playing sequence shows clear agency with visible cost—Ilya sacrifices payment and safety for artistic/spiritual fulfillment. Some middle sections could tighten the pressure more directly rather than dwelling in reflection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central opposition of preservation/control versus organic propagation/freedom without explicit moralizing. The final image of Ilya walking into sunlight with "the city answering" resonates as non-literal fulfillment. Coffee stains as destiny maps and the violin's dissolution into memory create layered meaning about art's true preservation through experience rather than archives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("sun like a thousand brass coins," "gravity brushed its strings with a thousand soft eyebrows"). POV maintains consistent telepathic perception of plants throughout. Some metaphorical density occasionally obscures immediate action but generally serves the accumulative texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, but several instances of abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("perforated destiny," "vacuum the dust of its story"). Some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("mulberry ache of decision bruise his ribs") that slightly slows momentum. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The telepathic plant communication and coffee-stain divination create fresh texture on the preservation-versus-release theme. The ice violin as simultaneously permanent and ephemeral offers conceptual originality. Execution transforms familiar artist-versus-institution conflict through specific mystical elements and the propagation-through-plants resolution.</comment>
