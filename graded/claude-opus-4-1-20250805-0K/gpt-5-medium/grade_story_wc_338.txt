I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered discoveries and pattern recognition rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's "methodically curious" nature drives genuine investigation with embodied details like feeling "cold air nick my fingertips." The final choice to frame the map "with the tear visible" shows earned wisdom through experience. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("guarded by gratitude") rather than fully embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative structure coheres as video evidence, physical exploration, and community gathering build toward reopening the chapel. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with "a wound is also a seam where one thing meets another," reweighting the torn map. Cost appears in the community's careful reverence and the verger's exhaustion, though the emotional price could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault with "peeled saints whose colors still breathe when the lamps warm" creates vivid tactile setting. The architectural detail of "a slit that drew storms through stones" directly explains the whispered effect. The henge bookends the piece effectively, threading "sheep between the stones like needles in old hands."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure builds through methodical investigation—comparing footage, tracing seams, gathering the village—toward the chapel's reopening. The dominant stake of understanding the blank space on maps resolves through discovery. The "steady physics of breath, stone, damp, and patience" provides satisfying explanation though personal cost remains understated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of tears as seams "where one thing meets another." The whispered chapel represents preserved memory requiring patient interpretation. The final note "Open to history, open to quiet" resonates without moralizing, though the piece occasionally states what could be implied ("to interpret silence with empathy").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains "shielded openness" through precise, observational prose like "rain eats old limestone like a slow animal with a patient tongue." The measured, professional tone fits the map framer's methodical nature. Slight register elevation in places ("purl through the gaps") doesn't quite match the otherwise grounded diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The church crouched beyond, small and stubborn as a knuckle." Some metaphor density in places ("rain moving across its slate like slow prayer") and occasional abstraction ("methodically curious" appears twice). The prose maintains good momentum despite contemplative pace.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a map framer investigating cartographic silence offers fresh perspective on discovery narratives. The specific synthesis of video evidence, architectural acoustics, and community memory feels organic. The whispered chapel as natural phenomenon rather than miracle subverts expectations effectively.</comment>
