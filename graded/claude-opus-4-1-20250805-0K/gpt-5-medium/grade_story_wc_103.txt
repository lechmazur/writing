<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "discover the texture of time" drives concrete actions through the halo fragment, with embodied reactions like "trembling notes" and ink "sweating like dew." The encounter with the woman and final acceptance of cost ("the cost is welcome if I can read its texture") shows earned transformation through specific experience, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("Forgiveness is a labyrinth too").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with patterns of disintegration/reformation building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts that "the present is a continual photograph fading." The halo fragment's transformation from shard to ring with the garden's final "quaking reverie that holds still" delivers closure with felt cost of accepting impermanence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The living bridge garden functions as dynamic setting that literally reorganizes through "hyperbolic geometry," with bridges that "grow where footprints wish to be" constraining navigation and enabling discovery. Vivid sensory work like "willow domes, each rib alive with ants stitching sun to shade" creates a world where environment actively shapes choices, particularly the submerged vault sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as the halo fragment intensifies from humming to vibrating harder, reorganizing space and revealing deeper temporal layers. The dominant stake of understanding time's texture deepens from physical exploration to confronting personal trauma (the library fire) to accepting temporal impermanence, with visible cost in accepting continual fading.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of memory, grief, and acceptance without explicit moralizing. The recurring motif of disintegration (library, buckets, books becoming birds) accumulates meaning that culminates in accepting "the present is a continual photograph fading," offering a resonant non-literal answer about time's nature through concrete particulars rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled compression and purposeful elision, teaching its pattern early through images like "hedges woven from roots that walk above streams." The perceptual signature remains consistent through stress, with syntax reflecting the narrator's maze-designer mind in structures like "exits pair with entrances," though occasional drift toward elevated register ("quaking reverie") slightly exceeds the established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of abstract philosophizing dilute momentum ("Forgiveness is a labyrinth too, one that returns you to the first question"). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats without clear payoff, and occasional register drift into elevated diction. The final line effectively recharges earlier motifs despite these friction points.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of maze design, temporal exploration, and grief processing through a garden of living bridges offers genuine originality. The hyperbolic geometry concept and the halo fragment's role as temporal interface create fresh angles on memory/time themes. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and surreal logic heightens stakes while maintaining coherence through the taught pattern.</comment>
