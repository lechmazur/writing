<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's choice to leave the prophecy unrecorded demonstrates clear internal conflict between duty and preventing harm, with embodied tension through the stylus going still and folding parchment. The transformation from child touching the phonograph to adult scribe refusing to perpetuate the cycle earns its weight through concrete memory work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Decisive Change lands through the narrator's choice to break the archival pattern, with visible cost in the unrecorded prophecy that would have prevented the orchard's destruction. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and memories layer toward the final renunciation, though some middle passages drift into pure description.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The orchard setting constrains choice effectively—quinces threatening to drop, roots that could crack the rooftop—creating genuine environmental pressure on the decision. Sensory work is selective and POV-filtered ("wetted bark and bruised quince"), though some passages catalog without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from archival duty to preventing generational harm, with the prophecy creating a genuine double-bind: refuse and the orchard destroys itself, accept and doom a child. The cost is legible in "the future shifts enough to shelter a child's unpinned breath," though middle sections could tighten pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete choice between recording truth and preventing harm, with the "pin in breath" motif effectively linking past trauma to future prevention. The final image of leaving truth "unwritten so its mercy can keep ripening" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the archival duty established early.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct voice through archaic diction ("venerable oath scribe") and selective perception focused on residue, echoes, and linguistic fragments. Some passages drift into elevated register that strains POV credibility ("ribboning through me as through the trees"), and dialogue absence limits full voice demonstration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density varies—strong passages like "I record with my stylus on the parchment, mapping stains, the pauses between words" do multiple jobs, but repetitive stems appear ("I have come," "I spread," "I speak," "I became"). Some metaphors strain clarity ("wave shouldering a swimmer") without enhancing meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The oath scribe who archives emotional patterns offers a fresh angle on memory and prophecy, particularly the notion of "accidental prophecy" arriving during work. The synthesis of ancient practice with modern setting (orchard atop skyscraper) creates specificity, though some elements feel assembled rather than inevitable.</comment>
