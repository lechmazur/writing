<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mapkeeper's internal experience is richly embodied through concrete sensory details ("ribs clatter like thin cups") and their choices under pressure show clear motivation. The protagonist's decision to plant the "bloom of hush" emerges from reading ice fractures and understanding both the caves' needs and the energy beings' nature, with visible cost in the physical effort and risk. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "hammered repose" that doesn't fully embody the emotional state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered sensory detail building to the bloom of hush as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with clear cost—the physical effort of creating the bloom and the ongoing commitment to "keep tending" it. The piece teaches its pattern early through the echo chamber stone's function and pays it off when the hush creates "rooms to pass through like weathered guests."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The harmonic caves function as active setting that constrains choices—the mapkeeper must find specific corridors and read ice patterns to succeed. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("air sounded like metal cooled under rain"), filtered through the mapkeeper's professional expertise. The echo chamber stone and cave formations directly enable the resolution, making the environment indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative pressure as the energy beings' arrival creates resonance storms that threaten the cave maps. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through deliberate choices—reading ice patterns, finding the right corridor, planting the bloom. Cost is visible in the physical effort and the ongoing responsibility accepted at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of finding "quiet in the storm"—not eliminating disruption but creating space for coexistence. The final image of the mapkeeper continuing to tend the bloom with the stone "warm again" resonates without stating a moral. The transformation of "hammered repose" from passive endurance to active cultivation deepens thematic complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through the mapkeeper's professional lens—noticing "ripple-marks," "drip lines," and "shy hieroglyphs of pressure." Voice maintains consistency through specialized vocabulary and measured rhythm that modulates with tension. The prose successfully avoids filter verbs and maintains immediacy through direct sensory engagement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure, but some instances of abstract phrasing ("gently luminous folds of charge") and occasional redundancy in describing the energy beings' effects. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "I [verb]" constructions reduces momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geological/sonic concepts with energy beings creates an original world. The specific solution of creating "blooms of hush" as accommodation rather than elimination shows creative problem-solving. The mapkeeper's specialized role and the caves' responsive nature avoid generic fantasy tropes, though some descriptive language tends toward the abstract rather than the viscerally specific.</comment>
