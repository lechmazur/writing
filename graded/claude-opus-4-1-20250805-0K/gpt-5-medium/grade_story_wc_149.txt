I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density builds through lyric repetition, ephemeral appearances accumulate into teaching, and the closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the bead becoming a doorway talisman that makes travelers pause "grateful without knowing why."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ghost bride's "lovingly venomous humor" and teaching through ephemeral appearances creates strong characterization, with her backstory of being left "under the bridge of years" providing clear motivation. The keeper's promise "like a fool, meaning it" shows internal contradiction effectively. Minor deduction for some emotional abstraction ("mournful elation") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the bead transforms from ferry token to doorway talisman, with clear cost (the ghost's departure: "vanished without receding"). The accumulative structure coheres through repeated ephemeral teachings building to the orchard's awakening. Slight deduction for dense backstory integration that occasionally slows momentum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The "alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night" creates a vivid, constraining environment where "each tree kept its breath like a vow." The carved stone bead's transformation from memory object to doorway talisman charges the final image perfectly. Sensory details like "slow cinders fell like confetti" effectively blend the spectral and physical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from the keeper lacking "the heart key" through learning resonant awakenings to the ghost's final departure creating permanent change. The trader's arrival tests the keeper's commitment. Cost is visible in the ghost's fading ("her veil curled to the floor") and the keeper's acceptance of loss for the orchard's awakening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the debt/repayment structure, with the ghost teaching that names don't matter, "only the answer matters." The final image of travelers pausing "grateful without knowing why" offers resonant closure without stating a moral. The exploration of memory, debt, and transformation avoids sentimentality through specific imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("glass arterial with vines"), though occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("mournful elation"). The ghost's dialogue effectively carries subtext: "you tune the bells but not the longing they must answer." Some filter phrases ("I recognized none") could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, but several instances of abstraction ("mournful elation," "ephemeral cameo appearances" repeated 3x) and occasional register elevation that doesn't fully match the keeper's voice. The opening and closing lines create effective circularity. Some sentences could be tightened for momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The ghost bride as teacher of resonant awakenings offers a fresh angle on the mentor-student dynamic. The specific detail of the carved stone bead as ferry token transformed into doorway talisman shows originality. The piece commits to its lyric accumulative mode, though some elements feel familiar from ghost-story traditions.</comment>
