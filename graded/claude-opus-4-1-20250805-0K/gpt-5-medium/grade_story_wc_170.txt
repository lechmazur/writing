I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the narrator learns to coax possibilities from mirrors rather than command them.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The borrowed heartbeat creates genuine internal contradiction - cautious yet eager, wanting to outgrow its host. The final choice to ask rather than command mirrors shows earned transformation through specific experience. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("dusky harmony") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost - the narrator must relinquish control and "ask mirrors...the way you ask a friend to stay for tea." The accumulative lens holds consistently through pattern teaching (coded lullabies) to final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terrace's "prism parapet after rain" constrains the search method beautifully. The studio's "hanging strands of water, each one quivering with a hidden note" creates lived-in specificity. Loses points for some abstract atmospheric descriptions that don't pressure choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through density increase - from seeking instruction to learning the method to seeing possibilities. The cost is clear: surrendering command for invitation. However, the middle section could tighten; some teaching moments feel slightly padded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between "persuade" and command, crystallizing in "you ask mirrors to show possibilities the way you ask a friend to stay for tea." The borrowed heartbeat metaphor for second chances resonates without stating its meaning. Final image of "the kind of day that could keep us" offers non-literal answer to mortality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout - "Evening pooled there in dusky harmony, as if the sky were tuning itself." Voice maintains lyric consistency under pressure. The metaphorical density serves the accumulative mode effectively, teaching its pattern early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "narrow as a thread of rain and different as heat over a road." However, several abstract phrases lack concrete grounding ("dusky harmony," "perceptively calm" used twice). Some figurative density borders on overwriting but stays pattern-consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of learning to ask rather than command possibilities offers fresh angle on wish-fulfillment. The mirage painter as teacher of coded lullabies feels specific and non-obvious. Execution is strong but doesn't quite reach the exceptional originality of 8.5+.</comment>
