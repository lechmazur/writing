I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to preserve authentic puzzle experiences against commercial pressure is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied responses (kneeling on damp planks, cupping seed). The internal conflict between profit and meaning drives genuine choices with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("innovation did not like crowds") that briefly slips from embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward Charged Poise—Mara crystallizing her stance to steward the mysterious gift against commercial pressures. Cost is visible in the "trickle" of profit she accepts and the confrontation she anticipates. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (the escape room context emerges gradually) and the closure relying heavily on conceptual rather than dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The nocturnal annex beside the brook creates atmospheric pressure and constrains choice—Mara must protect this specific space. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (storm-rinsed silence, damp planks, cedar and ozone). The setting actively participates in decision-making as the brook "keeps her secret" and the space itself requires protection from "dilution."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving authentic puzzle experiences versus commercial pressure—is clear and tightens through Mara's decision to commit to the corpse flower project despite anticipated resistance. The escalation through imagined confrontations with landlord and inspectors shows deepening commitment. However, the conflict remains largely anticipatory rather than dramatized on-page, limiting the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between nurturing impossible plants and nurturing human potential through puzzles. The concept that "small can scale through orthogonal approaches" resonates without moralizing. The final image of possibility keeping watch "like a patient lantern" offers a non-literal answer to questions about value versus profit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("the storm left the town rinsed and listening") and consistent POV. The perceptual signature—seeing puzzles and invitations where others see commerce—is character-specific. Rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity, though occasionally edges toward purple prose ("moonlight braid with current").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density with sentences doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("storm-born silence," "orthogonal approaches") creates mild opacity. Template cadence appears briefly ("She thought of...She thought of...") but doesn't pervade. Clear propulsion despite lyrical mode, though some abstract phrasing ("innovation did not like crowds") dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of escape room proprietor protecting artistic integrity against commercialization, with the corpse flower seed as unexpected catalyst. The concept of puzzles that "solve the solver" and rooms as "invitations to inhabit puzzles" offers original perspective. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure serves the theme of patient cultivation.</comment>
