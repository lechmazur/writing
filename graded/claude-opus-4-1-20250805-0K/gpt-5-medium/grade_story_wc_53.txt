Looking at this story through an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern rather than causal plot.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to negotiate with their ghost is embodied through concrete actions (climbing wind-ladders, offering the camera wheel, cataloging salvage). The ghost interaction shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—hoarding and spending regret—with the final renunciation of past ambitions earned through accumulated detail.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when narrator and ghost reach agreement through the camera wheel's "syncopation of possible days," with visible cost in letting go of eroded ambitions. The accumulative structure coheres as repeated water/mechanical imagery builds to "breath becomes a craft." Orientation anchors who/where by ~120 words ("I arrive as a resolute scavenger").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon functions as active setting—its churning enables memory transformation ("Windmills turn the water into memory"). Physical details constrain choices: wind-ladders require knotted stories to climb, the turbine raft provides negotiation space. The carousel bones below create vertical geography that shapes movement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: from seeking negotiation to offering concrete payment in verbs ("admit, forgive, rebuild, stay") to final agreement. Cost is legible in what's renounced—the penny city, certainty-plundering, eroded ambitions transformed to "sand good for gardens." The ghost's demands narrow options progressively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring water/mechanical imagery that reweights from erosion to cultivation. The final image of "breath becomes a craft" offers resonant answer to the opening's held breath without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the camera wheel's clicks—"bones learning arithmetic"—suggesting time's painful education.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "pockets jangling with hinges and promises," "ladders of wind," "turbines." Voice maintains lyric consistency under pressure with controlled compression ("I admit...I forgive...I promise...I stay"). No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "My motives are simple and unbearable" compresses character and stakes efficiently. Rhythm varies naturally between long accumulative sentences and short declarations. Minor template cadence in the "I admit/forgive/promise/stay" sequence serves intentional pattern rather than artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis in the kinetic lagoon as negotiation space between physical and memory. The camera wheel as time-navigation device ("choose which click to trust") transforms familiar ghost-meeting into specific mechanical metaphor. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulation heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
