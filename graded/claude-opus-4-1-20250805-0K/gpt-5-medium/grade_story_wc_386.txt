I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds meaning through layered imagery and pattern rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "salvage something pure from the wreckage" drives concrete actions from diving to globe retrieval to orchestrated revelation. Internal conflict between shouting accusation versus gentle exposure ("exposure is a gentle blade") shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to let people "see themselves in the mirror first" is earned through prior pattern of careful truth-weaving.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the foreman "lowered his eyes" after the tapping matched maintenance logs, with visible cost in Sofia's husband turning the crank "until it stuck." The accumulative lens holds as density builds from individual dreams to collective testimony to town-wide rhythm. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2 ("candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ice shrine with portholes facing black water constrains the narrator's method of connection and shapes how truth surfaces. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("breath makes halos," "salt-stiffened coat," "cabins gape like pulled teeth"). The melted snow globe as micro-setting drives the final revelation, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("cliff of blue glass").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual hauntings to collective dreams to public confrontation, with the dominant stake of exposing corporate negligence signaled early through "the official story insisted." The tightening occurs when the music box password reveals "the name of a welding company nobody trusted," foreclosing the rivet explanation. Cost is visible in the foreman's physical surrender and Sofia's husband's exhausted grief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth surfacing through patient accumulation rather than violent exposure emerges through the central metaphor of diving/surfacing and the narrator's method of weaving truth "carefully." The final image of the globe shining then resting reweights all prior tapping as both evidence and elegy. "Exposure is a gentle blade when you want the wound to heal without infection" crystallizes the thematic stance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "borrowed starlight," "wreck-diver ghost whisperer," and synesthetic perception where candles echo tapping. Voice maintains poetic compression consistently through metaphors like "cabins gape like pulled teeth." Psychic distance shifts purposefully from lyric overview to intimate scene work when discovering the globe.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("I dove at dawn, when the sky brightens like an eyelid"). Some figurative density in peak beats borders on overwriting ("ferry's ribs," "pulled teeth," "milky bruise" in quick succession). Template cadence appears briefly ("They had cut corners...sealing old wounds") but doesn't pervade. Strong propulsion through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost whispering with corporate negligence investigation offers a non-obvious angle on the ferry disaster trope. Specific detail like the music box password hidden in a child's toy transforms familiar elements. The choice to orchestrate gentle collective revelation rather than direct accusation shows meaningful risk-taking that serves theme.</comment>
