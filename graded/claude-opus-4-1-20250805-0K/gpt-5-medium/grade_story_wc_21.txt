<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation to uncover suppressed truth drives consistent choices through documentary arrangement and ancestral connection. Internal conflict between professional duty and personal haunting creates genuine tension, particularly when the grandmother appears as both memory and guide. The final choice to distribute truth despite institutional resistance shows earned change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as beach arrangements accumulate into revelation, with the diary warming and lagoon darkening as pattern indicators. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration when the city "speaks, a music that was always there," with cost visible in the officials facing signatures and the protagonist remaining "half-retrocognitively trapped." The encrypted diary discovery pays off through stenograph punches that bloom into suppressed testimony.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon functions as both setting and active participant, drinking starlight and showing visions that constrain choices. Beach debris becomes documentary material, with shells and kelp serving as communication tools. The zeppelin library provides unique aerial perspective that shapes the archivist's role, though some atmospheric details remain ornamental rather than choice-constraining.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal cataloging to civic reckoning as the archivist moves from passive documentation to active reconstruction through beach arrangements. The retrocognitive trap forces confrontation with suppressed history, narrowing options to either retreat or full disclosure. Cost manifests in being "half-retrocognitively trapped" permanently, a price paid for truth's restoration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between official erasure and persistent memory, with the lagoon as "keeper of unsurrendered echoes" embodying this conflict. The circular time concept ("time is a circular affidavit") deepens the exploration of how suppressed truth resurfaces. The final image of the city learning "to read itself aloud" offers resonant answer to the question of historical accountability without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric-archival register with controlled compression ("I catalog history to keep it from drowning"). Perceptual signature shows through documentary metaphors applied to natural elements. Some register elevation in peak moments ("retrocognitively trapped," "circular affidavit") strains POV credibility but serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes waits like an eye sunk in cooled lava") but suffers from abstract constructions that obscure concrete action. Phrases like "the pattern ripens" and "a topography of defiance spelled in refuse" prioritize lyricism over clarity. Some template cadence appears in the repetitive "I + verb" constructions mid-story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of arranging beach debris as historical documentation offers fresh angle on archival work. The retrocognitive trap mechanism and circular time structure take risks that mostly pay off. The synthesis of civil rights history with supernatural elements through the lagoon's memory-keeping creates non-obvious resonance.</comment>
