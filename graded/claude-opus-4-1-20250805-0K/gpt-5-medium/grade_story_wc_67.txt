<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to transform trauma into art is embodied through concrete actions (grinding envelopes, scattering ash) with internal contradiction between exposure and protection. The mother's evolution from guarding secrets to offering the chair shows earned change through micro-choices. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("mirage of safety") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases toward the Resonant Reconfiguration where mother and child witness together "the cost of surviving without a witness." The circular structure (chair stopping to stopping) creates Earned Stasis with visible emotional cost. Who/where/when anchored early through concrete details.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting functions as emotional architecture—the rocking chair, porcelain mask, and gallery skylight all constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details filtered through artist's POV ("night opens like a sketchbook"). The chair's physical presence drives the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming family trauma into witnessed art) escalates from private creation to public exhibition to shared acknowledgment. The mother's progression from resistance to participation creates meaningful tightening. Cost is legible in "surviving without a witness" and the chair's loaded rhythm.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the mask's kintsugi seams that "refuse to hide brokenness" and visitors filling gaps "with their own ghosts." The final image of mother and child witnessing together reweights all prior secrecy without stating a moral. "Danger cannot bear to be named outright" crystallizes the thematic stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through artist's lens ("charcoal portrait ash scatterer," "curator of residue"). Dialogue carries subtext ("Take what you need" with the unspoken remainder). Minor compression under pressure maintains coherence. Some elevated diction fits the artist-narrator's register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The house exhales dust"). Some repetitive phrasing around "mirage of safety" and occasional abstract constructions ("the cost of surviving without a witness") that could be more embodied. Clear propulsion through varied sentence structures.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art-as-testimony through specific details (kintsugi mask, ash from unmailed letters). The concept of incomplete information as artistic method transforms trauma narrative conventions. Risk-taking in the elliptical approach to abuse heightens stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
