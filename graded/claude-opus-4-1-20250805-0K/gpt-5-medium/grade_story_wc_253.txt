<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's blank-faced performance as survival strategy creates compelling internal contradiction between mandated cheer and authentic grief. The teaching of "remade hush" to children shows layered motivation—complicity and resistance operating simultaneously. Minor deduction for the inspector scene relying on convenient gullibility rather than earned deception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds through repetition of performance, turbines, and dried flowers toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "something finally did not" work—a crystallized resistance with clear cost (surveillance risk). The progression from morning performance to evening whittling to teaching children creates coherent pressure. Slight dock for the inspector's too-easy satisfaction undermining stakes momentarily.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Turbines as clock hands and dried petals as "small brown shrapnel" create vivid sensory specificity that mirrors internal state. The farmhouse setting constrains choices through surveillance infrastructure. Deduction for some abstract passages ("silence saunters in, thin as a foal") that drift from the concrete embodiment elsewhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal compliance to corrupting children, with the narrator teaching both angles of joy and subversive pauses. The inspector visit raises immediate danger. Cost is visible in "familiar vacancy where victory should sit" but the resolution's refusal to work feels slightly abstract rather than decisively embodied.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the distinction between happiness (mandated performance) and lightness (authentic grief work). The dried bouquet transforms from funeral marker to teaching tool, reweighting its meaning. Final line "something finally did not" offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question of resistance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through "Behold" narrations and metaphors like "apocalypse for a spoon" creates memorable texture. POV control remains steady with selective perception of turbines, children, silence. Minor inconsistency in register when philosophical abstractions ("lightness can carry; happiness is ballast") interrupt the embodied voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("turbines cast slow shadows...like clock hands that forgot their point"). Rhythm varies naturally between performance segments and quiet observations. Deduction for occasional abstract drift ("remade hush, one that earns its floorboards") and slight repetition of "Behold" structure without sufficient variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The happiness mandate dystopia feels fresh through specific details like "Gratitude Transition" funerals and dramatic dishwashing performances. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure and the subtle resistance narrative elevates stakes. The synthesis of surveillance capitalism and grief work creates non-obvious resonance.</comment>
