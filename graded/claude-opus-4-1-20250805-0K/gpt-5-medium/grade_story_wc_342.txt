I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered sensory detail and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the mural survives the building's demolition.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's prosopagnosia creates a distinct perceptual signature that shapes how they read the tree's grain and paint without faces, earning specificity. Internal conflict between urgency and precision plays out through micro-choices like testing paint limits. The final choice to hide the letter and trust the mural's survival lands with earned conviction, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("edges and weights, not faces").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the mural holds its dawn while the building falls, with visible cost in the destruction around the preserved tree. The accumulative structure builds through layered discovery (coin → atlas → pigments → mural) with clear causality. The orientation anchors (tree library, demolition countdown) establish stakes immediately. Minor deduction for slightly delayed specificity about the protagonist's exact task.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tree trunk library functions as both setting and constraint, its rings becoming a map that unlocks the secret. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("dust into motes," "greened by time"). The countdown pressure shapes every micro-choice. The environment directly enables the solution through the coin-to-ring matching, making setting indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: silence deepening → countdown approaching → foreman waiting → "one more minute" granted. The dominant stake (preserving sky-knowledge before demolition) tightens through each discovery. Cost is visible in the building's destruction and the risk taken. The protagonist's agency drives each beat, though the middle section could compress slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of preserving beauty against destruction, with the mural as physical embodiment of memory surviving loss. The coin's "faint indentations" that unlock knowledge parallel the subtle marks we leave. The ending reweights the opening "hush" as both destruction and preservation. Subtext operates cleanly through gesture and image rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinctive register of careful observation ("breath chooses careful places to be") that reflects the protagonist's perceptual condition. Psychic distance modulates effectively from wide (building waiting) to intimate (heart slowing). The prose rhythm mimics the story's stillness and sudden acceleration. Minor repetition of "faint indentations" could vary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The heightened stillness trembles the dust into motes"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating toward closure. Some figurative language edges toward density ("hush arrives like a held breath") but serves the accumulative mode. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("promise" used twice) and slight redundancy in describing the painting process.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of prosopagnosia with art-making offers genuine freshness—a portrait artist who cannot see faces painting faceless sky. The specific solution (coin patterns matching tree rings) feels inevitable yet surprising. The story transforms the demolition trope through the paradox of preservation within destruction. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative approach heightens rather than obscures stakes.</comment>
