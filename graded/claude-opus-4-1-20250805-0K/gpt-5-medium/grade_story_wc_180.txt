I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration where the cathedral's orchard is restored through ritualized letting-go.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation as a grieving father unable to "father rightly" creates genuine internal conflict, with the daughter's hair ribbon serving as embodied emotional anchor. Mira's presence provides immediate relational pressure that forces micro-choices. The final graft with the ribbon shows contradictory impulses (holding on/letting go) acting simultaneously with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the deciduous vow ritual restores the orchard's natural cycle, with the daughter's ribbon literally tied into the solution—a visible cost that charges the final image. The accumulative build through pruning/grafting/bell-ringing creates density that reweights the opening decay. "Call it accidental wisdom, the kind that fixes you while fixing wood" crystallizes the transformation with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard hybrid setting directly constrains choices—the narrator must climb rafters, work with specific decay patterns, improvise ritual without clergy. "Branches arched like ribs, heavy with peaches and pears and a small ache of neglect" establishes the space as both physical and emotional terrain. The environment actively shapes tactics through its vertical architecture and organic/sacred duality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional repair to personal healing through Mira's presence and the ribbon's discovered significance. The tightening occurs when the narrator must use his daughter's ribbon for the ritual—foreclosing the option of keeping it untouched. Cost is visible in "I closed my fist over it until the quartz throbbed" and the final acceptance that either daughter or Mira will claim it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the deciduous vow metaphor—letting go enables renewal—without stating morals. The final image of "accidental wisdom, the kind that fixes you while fixing wood" offers a non-literal answer to loss and repair. The tin remaining unopened while the ribbon is released creates meaningful ambiguity about different forms of holding/releasing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice through compound constructions ("quartz-eye mender") and specific lexicon ("sap slurred," "deciduous vows"). Perceptual signature shows in how the narrator sees through repair metaphors—"cracks my quartz eye saw." Dialogue between narrator and Mira maintains naturalistic asymmetry with her childlike questions and his oblique responses carrying subtext about fatherhood.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong figurative density occasionally tips toward overwriting—"small ache of neglect," "dropped marble rolling"—but serves the accumulative mode. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some template cadence in middle sections ("We needed...So I set...Out came...") disrupts flow. Final paragraph's rhythm accelerates effectively toward closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The deciduous vow concept transforms religious imagery through organic metaphor in a non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in the cathedral-orchard fusion and the ritual improvisation heightens stakes. The specific detail of grafting spiritual and horticultural repair avoids generic grief narratives through its particular metaphorical system.</comment>
