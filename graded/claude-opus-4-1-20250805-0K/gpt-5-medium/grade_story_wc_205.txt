<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to vindicate a revolutionary past through archaeological evidence is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like pressing the shard to temple and measuring breath-marks. Internal conflict between failed revolution and hope for vindication drives meaningful choices. The final moment of sorrow when the shard cracks shows earned emotional cost, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("futility minted in my bones").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure where covering mirrors during storms allows the shard's song to strengthen, building to council vindication—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (the shard cracking, revolutionary failure remaining). The drive lens holds consistently through pattern accumulation. Orientation anchors (asteroid, excavation, rival theories) establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting with "veils of years" and "gilt dust spinning in drafts" creates vivid atmosphere that constrains action—storms make minutes stream, mirrors must be covered, the shard can only sing in specific conditions. Setting directly enables the discovery method and charges the final image of burnished sorrow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from academic dispute through public challenge to council adjudication, with clear cost at each stage (access threatened, public readings as counter-move, final validation but shard breaks). The protagonist's agency drives escalation through ritual innovation and public demonstration. Cost is visible when "sorrow shone, burnished" as the shard cracks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of ornament as solidarity versus tyranny emerges through concrete discovery and demonstration, not assertion. The shard's message "we made, we made, we made, until the making made us equal" resonates against both revolutionary failure and archaeological dispute. Final image of covering mirrors "not to forget but to listen" offers non-literal answer to whether beauty can encode collective memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevated diction ("baroque asteroid glowed with veils of years") that maintains consistency through emotional peaks. Perceptual signature shows poet-revolutionary's lens: seeing "gilt dust," hearing "cadence" in vibrations, translating "rises and rests." No dialogue present to evaluate, but internal voice remains coherent through pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("futility minted in my bones," "contamination by ideology"). Information density high in descriptive passages. Minor register elevation in places doesn't match the embodied discovery scenes, though no loops or scaffolding present.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archaeological discovery with visible time creates non-obvious premise. The specific method of covering mirrors to hear extinct voices through storm-charged artifacts feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric-speculative mode heightens stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
