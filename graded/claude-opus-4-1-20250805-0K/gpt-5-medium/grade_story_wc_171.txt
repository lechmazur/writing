I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural** lens, as it builds pressure through ritual accumulation and pattern rather than causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The negotiator's patient, methodical approach creates a consistent character whose "operatively gentle" methods shape every interaction. Internal consistency is strong through ritual gestures and measured responses. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("pits of anger softening") rather than fully embodied reactions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through "The forever war did not end, but it loosened its grip" with visible cost in the bowl of casings and annual return promise. The accumulative structure coheres well through ritual steps. Deduction for slightly abstract cost representation - while the emotional weight is felt, the specific trade-offs could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The terrace functions brilliantly as both physical space and constraint, with cracked stones, fennel/thyme, and the bowl of casings all participating in choices. "The terrace forgives nothing, but it remembers patience" elevates setting to active participant. Celestial timing creates natural pressure without forcing urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative ritual - from names to water to casings to final standing together. The dominant stake (achieving workable peace through shared work rather than punishment) remains consistent. Some middle sections feel more lateral than escalating, though the final movement to the sea creates meaningful deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through concrete action: "Redemption is priced by work shared, not suffering hoarded." The bowl of casings transforms from "bitter bouquet" to shared burden. Final image of the child tracing cracks between stones offers resonant non-literal answer about finding paths through damage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent formal register appropriate to a peace negotiator, with selective perception focused on gesture and ritual significance. Some passages drift toward abstract meditation ("Timing was mercy here") rather than staying grounded in the narrator's specific perceptual signature. Dialogue feels purposeful when it appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of excellence ("lanterns shook like small moons") but suffers from repetitive sentence structures, particularly "I [verb]" and "We [verb]" patterns. Several paraphrase loops appear ("Patience was our armor, and our debt to the fallen" restates prior content). Information density is moderate; some lines do single duty only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of peace negotiation through ritual significance rather than traditional bargaining offers fresh angle. Specific details like lockpicks alongside olive branches and the child's desire for "water that tastes like rain" create originality through particulars. The ritual-as-negotiation framework transforms familiar peace-talk material.</comment>
