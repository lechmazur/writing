I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor for a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases and patterns build toward a resonant reconfiguration. The narrator's empirical investigation accumulates with memories (father's ship, Underground Railroad) until the final decision to carry the lantern forward rather than surrender it to evidence.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The investigator's watchful calm modulates effectively under pressure, particularly when resisting supervisor messages and choosing fidelity to the dead. The entanglement of personal memory (father's ship) with professional duty creates genuine internal conflict. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("fortified vulnerability held like a drawn line") that edges toward therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the investigator keeps the lantern "because some light belongs to use, not to storage," with visible professional cost (defying protocol). The accumulative structure coheres as memories layer with present investigation. Slight opacity in the men's actual death mechanism ("hearts surrendered to something uncounted") prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tunnel setting actively constrains choices through salt-locked drains and the dead third rail. Excellent micro-details like "Salt had crusted at the grates, the white teeth of thirst." The lantern as object-setting charges the final image meaningfully. Some spatial choreography remains vague during the investigation sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from routine investigation to defying algorithmic closure pressure, with the investigator's job potentially at risk. The tension between empirical observation and entangled memory creates genuine conflict. The actual drowning mechanism lacks clarity, slightly weakening the central mystery's resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lantern's dual role as Underground Railroad relic and present signal. The concept of "light belongs to use, not to storage" resonates without moralizing. The entanglement of past and present suffering ("memories entangled, not like vines choking, but like ropes braided for strength") avoids easy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("the city exhales through its tunnels, wet breath rising where dust ruled yesterday"). The investigator's professional register effectively tensions with moments of personal revelation. Some elevated diction ("reverberate," "sedimented") occasionally strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("white teeth of thirst"). Some overwriting appears in abstract passages ("fortified vulnerability held like a drawn line within me"). Minor template cadence in the middle investigation sequence ("I logged... I kneeled... I lifted"). Information density is high but occasionally tips toward opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of workplace investigation with historical memory and personal loss. The preventable death investigator examining deaths that mirror larger patterns of institutional failure offers non-obvious insight. The lantern as both practical object and carrier of memory avoids cliché through specific handling.</comment>
