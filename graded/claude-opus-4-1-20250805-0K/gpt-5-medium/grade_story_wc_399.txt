<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's dedication to preserving echoes through ritual creates consistent motivation, with embodied details like "I feel the prophet watching without intrusion" and physical gestures grounding the character work. The half-masked line walker's "strangely honest" eyes and peripheral awareness technique establish distinct characterization. However, the prophet remains more symbolic presence than active character, and the emotional stakes of preservation lack the contradictory impulses that would elevate to higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through ritual repetition and imagery accumulation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "the echo of wisdom settle[s] against my ribs and stay[s]." The cost manifests as daily vigilance against forgetting ("the valley forgets quickly, and we will not"). Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the cyclical structure reinforces the endurance theme, though the closure could land with more visceral weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion and kinetic parapet beneath the dunes create a vivid, constraining environment where "boundaries are not lines but inhale and release." Sensory detail like "feet blackened by drift soot" and "hushed consonants, like a creek hiding under planks" grounds the mystical setting. The environment actively shapes choices—the parapet "rises where the wind wants to steal syllables"—directly constraining the preservation work and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes center on preserving wisdom against environmental entropy, with escalation through the midday wind that "wants to scatter vowels" requiring active response ("The walker quickens, strings a line across the gust"). The dominant stake of preservation against forgetting coheres throughout, with cost visible in the daily repetition. However, the conflict lacks a decisive tightening moment that would foreclose options or force harder trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between "blare collapses, echo endures," exploring how wisdom persists through careful tending rather than proclamation. The peripheral awareness motif ("catching its shimmer only as it leaks toward us") reinforces themes of indirect perception and humility. The final image of echoes settling "against my ribs" offers resonant closure without moralizing, though the thematic complexity could deepen with more internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with distinctive perceptual signature ("memory in this valley became skittish, like deer at the margin"). The prose rhythm modulates effectively, accelerating during the wind crisis and settling into contemplative cadence at closure. Dialogue appears minimally but carries weight ("we can widen the clearing if we trust its margin"), though the uniformly elevated register occasionally distances rather than immerses.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines like "He plants the heel of his foot at the pavilion's lip, and I open the pages" doing multiple jobs. Some repetitive structures appear ("He comes because," "He finds them through") but serve the ritual pattern. Minor scaffold in phrases like "strangely honest" repeated without variation, and occasional elevated diction ("consecrate," "litany") that could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept of preserving wisdom through whispered ritual rather than proclamation offers fresh perspective on prophecy and knowledge transmission. The peripheral awareness technique and the physical manifestation of boundaries as breathing entities show genuine originality. The synthesis of mystical and embodied elements feels earned, though some imagery (prophet as absent hum, memory as skittish deer) draws from familiar wells.</comment>
