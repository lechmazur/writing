I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference**: This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where pattern density, sensory layering, and cadence shifts build toward a resonant reconfiguration. The story accumulates understanding through postcards, cathedral glass layers, and night-blooming patterns until the final revelation reweights everything.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is grounded in the specific question about night-blooming flowers, and their patient, methodical pursuit creates consistent character pressure. The final recognition that "my murals were doors" represents earned understanding through accumulated experience, though some interior passages lean toward abstraction ("a hinge turn, and a new mural unfolded inside me").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds through layered discoveries—postcards, cathedral glass, scent patterns—toward the grandmother's final postcard that reframes the entire journey as inheritance and continuation. The closure lands with emotional cost (grandmother's absence) and conceptual repricing ("night is the gentlest daylight we have"), though the orientation takes slightly long to establish the present action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory specificity: "cards smelled of cloves and iron," "cool draft braided itself through the glass layers," "air inside tasted of resin and apples." The cathedral window's etched layers literally constrain perception and enable discovery, while the amber pavilion transforms light into the story's final understanding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—deepens through accumulated discoveries rather than reversals, appropriate for the textural lens. The progression from winter through autumn creates natural pressure, and the final public presentation adds social stakes, though the conflict remains primarily internal/intellectual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the central metaphor of night-blooming as "not rebellion but courtship," developing organically through concrete discoveries. The final line "my murals were doors" offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire journey without stating a moral, achieving genuine thematic resonance through accumulated particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with consistent elevated register and perceptual signature: "pressing its petals to my throat," "a hush move under it like a cat between rails." The controlled, contemplative rhythm matches the patient investigation, though occasional abstractions ("umbral tenderness") risk opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with high information density and varied syntax, but some figurative density in peak moments: "I felt a hinge turn, and a new mural unfolded inside me" mixes metaphors. Several passages achieve exceptional clarity: "Night, I thought, is not the opposite of day but a careful engraving that lets certain truths appear."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of botanical night-blooming with artistic creation through inherited postcards creates an original angle on artistic inheritance. The specific detail of cathedral glass layers as sensory filters and the amber pavilion as transformative space elevate familiar mentor-student dynamics into something distinctive.</comment>
