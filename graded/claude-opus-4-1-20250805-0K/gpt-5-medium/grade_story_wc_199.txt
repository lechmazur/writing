I'll evaluate this story systematically under the demanding editorial standards.

**Drive Lens Inference**: This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density builds through ritual actions, sensory layering, and pattern recognition, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration about the nature of transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is clear and rooted in inherited craft tradition, with concrete embodied actions (sorting seeds, building monuments, decoding leaves). The final realization that "what emerges transformed always is the hearer, never the leaf" represents genuine internal shift with visible cost (the narrator must keep "ears growing" indefinitely). Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator realizes their role is continuous receptivity rather than mastery. The cost is legible: eternal apprenticeship to the arbor's wisdom. The phrase "Emerges transformed always" serves as the pivotal discovery that reweights all prior sorting and monument-building. Orientation is clear by ~100 words with who (seed sorter), where (skyborne arbor), when (the hush).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor functions as more than setting—it constrains choices through its language of falling leaves and shapes the narrator's ritual actions. Vivid sensory detail ("lichens that sip thunder," "ash sifts like sugar") creates atmosphere while the monuments and sorting trays provide tactile grounding. The environment directly enables the central decoding action and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the arbor's message—builds through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens. Pressure coheres through the ritual's stages: waiting for the hush, interpreting leaves, building new monuments. The cost manifests in accepting perpetual transformation rather than achieving mastery. One point off for relatively gentle escalation that could push harder against resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of sorting/reading as forms of attention to forgotten things. The insight "what emerges transformed always is the hearer" reweights all prior actions without moralizing. The monuments to "forgotten things" create resonance about memory and attention. Subtext operates through the grandmother's wisdom and the arbor's conversation rather than judgment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct voice with lyrical compression and purposeful repetition ("monument" recurs meaningfully). The perceptual signature is selective—focusing on minute details like "dust speck" and "coal-pale wind." Syntax varies between long accumulative sentences and shorter declarations. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("filigreed stacks") that slightly exceeds the established range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with high information density and varied rhythm. Some figurative density in places ("raftered branches," "filigreed stacks") but it serves the accumulative mode. Clean grammar and purposeful paragraph structure. Deduction for occasional ornamental phrases and slight overwriting in descriptive passages that don't always advance pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a tree that "converses" rather than judges offers a fresh angle on oracle narratives. The specific synthesis of seed-sorting, leaf-reading, and monument-building creates an original ritual system. The transformation—that the reader changes, not the text—subverts expectations. Some elements feel slightly derivative of mystical tree archetypes.</comment>
