I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Identification**: This operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens - the piece builds through layered revelations via the doodles/tickets, with density increasing toward the communal resolution where trust crystallizes.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's internal progression from "coward" to public confessor is earned through concrete discoveries via the lens and doodles. The contradiction between duty as registrar and fear of transparency creates genuine tension. Motivation crystallizes believably as evidence accumulates, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("I am also a coward, learning to be freed by honesty").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the public revelation transforms mistrust into collective acceptance, with visible cost in the narrator's vulnerability and the curator's bow. The accumulative structure coheres as doodle revelations build toward communal healing. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3. Minor deduction for slightly mechanical resolution where all parties converge too harmoniously.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt functions as more than backdrop - its reflective surfaces enable the central mechanic of reading truth through the lens. "Puddles murmuring like glass throats" and crystals that "chime at the edges" create synaesthetic texture. The projector/screen setup grounds the climactic revelation spatially. Setting actively shapes how truth emerges through reflection and projection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from private knowledge-keeping to public risk-taking, with the narrator's confession creating genuine vulnerability. The accumulative pressure through discovered doodles tightens toward the public revelation. Cost is visible in exposure and the curator's physical bow, though the resolution's universal acceptance slightly deflates earned tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of transparency, projection, and collective truth-seeking without explicit moralizing. The lens becomes both literal tool and thematic vehicle for "transparency thawing mistrust." The final image of crystals tuning the community resonates without stating its meaning. Strong integration of physical and conceptual layers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "puddles murmuring like glass throats," "blame pulsed like a negative." The perceptual signature focuses on light, reflection, and cryptic visual interpretation fitting the registrar role. Consistent psychic distance maintains the contemplative register. No dialogue to evaluate, which suits the "after words become unnecessary" frame perfectly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with moments of genuine beauty ("crystal whispering forecourt after rain breathes with a resonant hush"). Some metaphoric density approaches overwriting ("blame pulsed like a negative") and occasional abstract phrasing ("the truth, exposed, is gentle enough to sleep in") dulls precision. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The wordless communication through doodles offers fresh specificity to the post-verbal society concept. The synthesis of projection technology with truth-revelation through communal witnessing transforms familiar reconciliation tropes. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and absence of dialogue heightens the piece's distinctiveness, though the harmonious resolution trends toward safety.</comment>
