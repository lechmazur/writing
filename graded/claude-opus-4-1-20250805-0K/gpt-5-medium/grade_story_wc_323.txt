<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation crystallizes through concrete details like touching the anchor chain link and teaching edge geometry to students who "want the same" impossible navigation. Internal contradiction plays out in scene as they teach stellar navigation while knowing "our windows still show only kelp shadows." The final choice to teach students to "listen to the edges" and "let the horizon unfold until it tells you where to fall" carries visible cost—accepting their submerged existence while transforming its meaning.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through layered images of edges, rays, and unfolded horizons until the aliens' return triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator "knew then how to teach them all." The cost lands in "I bowed with my palms open in the dim"—accepting their underwater prison while finding stellar navigation through pressure marks. Orientation anchors immediately (benthic city, navigation instructor) and the pattern of edge geometry constrains tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The benthic city's "ceilings ripple like slow glass" and "windows still show only kelp shadows" create immediate atmospheric pressure that shapes the narrator's teaching methods. The anchor chain link functions as micro-setting, its "cold ring of cause" constraining choices when carried during night crawls. The final image of bowing "with my palms open in the dim" gains resonance from the accumulated weight of underwater imprisonment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to navigate by impossible starlight—deepens through teaching edge geometry, volunteering for night crawls, and finally communicating with aliens through "a pattern...like a constellation pressed into water." The tightening occurs when aliens respond with "unfolded horizons" that reveal "stars traced by pressure," forcing the narrator to accept a transformed understanding. Cost is visible in accepting their permanent submersion while finding transcendence through edges.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete paradox of stellar navigation underwater, never stated but embodied in teaching "edge geometry" where "stars are not points but pressures." The final instruction to "listen to the edges...let the horizon unfold until it tells you where to fall" reweights the entire premise without moralizing. The anchor chain's "cold ring of cause" becomes both prison and compass, earning its symbolic weight through repeated handling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges in phrases like "a sky turned inward" and "patience drift of silt," with controlled rhythm that slows during teaching moments and accelerates during the alien encounter. The voice maintains lyric compression throughout—"wonder can drown as surely as lungs"—without sacrificing clarity. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("benthic," "scarp") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "I tell my students that the sea is a sky turned inward, a vault of pressure and echoes" establishes teaching role, worldview, and atmospheric pressure simultaneously. Rhythm varies naturally from short declarations to flowing accumulative passages. Minor template cadence in middle teaching section ("I tell them," "They called it," "I keep") costs 0.3.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of underwater stellar navigation through "edge geometry" feels both impossible and inevitable, with risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure that maintains clarity through pattern teaching. The specific detail of "unfolded horizons" as both map and prayer, combined with the transformation of stellar navigation into pressure marks, creates a non-obvious resolution. Bonus 0.3 for structural risk that heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
