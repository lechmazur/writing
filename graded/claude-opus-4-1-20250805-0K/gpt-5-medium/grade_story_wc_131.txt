<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crawl space dweller's characterization through embodied details ("shuffling with pads of felt on knees") and consistent motivation ("to become visible to those who need you") drives the story effectively. His internal conflict between remaining hidden and helping manifests in concrete action when he guides the girl to the notebook, though the emotional stakes could deepen further at the moment of choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with effective density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when the dweller helps the girl find her mother's notebook, crystallizing his purpose. The closure lands with felt cost ("heart big as a boiler") and the etched arrow suggests future visibility, though the causal linkage between the tape's "sense memory" and finding the notebook could be clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The crawl spaces, ducts, and library architecture constrain the dweller's movements and enable his unique form of help—setting functions as character. Sensory details like "sapphire hush spilling through gaps" and "cedar and iron" breath create atmosphere while the physical infrastructure shapes every choice he makes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from passive listening to active intervention when the outage creates the "right conditions" for the tape to work. The dweller's choice to help despite fear ("fear is a lantern that reveals and burns") shows agency, though the resolution feels somewhat convenient given the tape's mysterious properties.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of invisible service emerges through concrete details—the dweller's "cache of found comforts" and methodical mapping create meaning without stating morals. The final arrow etched near the grate suggests future visibility earned through service, though the "sense memory" concept remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice emerges through unusual constructions ("a mapper of vents and joists") and poetic compression ("the windows faintly breathed a failing constellation"). The perceptual signature—experiencing the world through sound, vibration, and architectural knowledge—remains consistent throughout with controlled rhythm that mirrors the dweller's methodical nature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("He crawled to the northeast pipe chase, where heat lines ticked down and whispering gathered"). Some metaphorical density in early passages ("velvet seam threaded by drafts") borders on overwriting but serves the accumulative mode, while the repeated phrase "while the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage" creates intentional pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The crawl space dweller as invisible helper offers a fresh perspective on urban isolation and service, with specific details like ferromagnetic tape reading "sense memory" avoiding generic treatment. The concept of someone living between walls who helps through architectural knowledge feels both original and emotionally resonant.</comment>
