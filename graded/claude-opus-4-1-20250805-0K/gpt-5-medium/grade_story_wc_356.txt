I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through sensory layers and pattern accumulation rather than strict causality, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the village finds equilibrium through accepting the corpse flower's stink.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The herbalist's olfactory sensitivity drives concrete choices throughout, from reading grandmother's doodles to interpreting the beetles' message. The final acceptance of rot as balance shows earned transformation with visible communal cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("ambition was a restless root") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where accepting the corpse flower's stink stabilizes the swaying bridges—a clear before/after with felt communal cost. The accumulative structure coheres well through sensory layering. Slight deduction for the abstract "turning of the tide's thought" which delays concrete temporal anchoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The treetop village setting directly constrains choices—the swaying bridges create the central problem the corpse flower solves. Vivid sensory work ("boards swayed like breathing") and the bridge's convergence point matters causally. Could strengthen spatial choreography of the village layout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: village instability → seed arrival → community resistance → bloom's stink → collective acceptance. The cost is legible in the village "flinching as if truths had teeth." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the middle resistance could intensify.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the concrete metaphor of rot as balance—"rot is a road back to balance, and grief perfumes the way home." The ending reweights the opening's "serenity within motion" without stating a moral. The corpse flower becomes a non-literal answer to instability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("currents of scent that stitched the canopy"). The perceptual signature of olfactory sensitivity remains consistent. Some elevated diction ("spadix speared dusk") fits the herbalist's expertise. Minor repetition in syntactic patterns during the middle section.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery, but several abstract constructions slow momentum ("the turning of the tide's thought," "undercurrent of wisdom"). Some template cadence in the planting sequence. The final paragraph achieves excellent density where multiple elements converge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corpse flower as community healing agent inverts typical revulsion. The specific detail of using "tea of jasmine and ash" to temper the stink shows originality. The premise of motion-sickness in a treetop village offers a non-obvious angle, though some metaphors feel familiar.</comment>
