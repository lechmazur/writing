I'll evaluate this story systematically through each category.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to find safer light after the fire tragedy is clear and embodied through patient glass-polishing action. Internal conflict between honoring brother's memory and choosing patience over quickness drives the piece. The final choice to create gentle light instead of fire represents earned endurance with visible communal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through glass polishing that builds to Resonant Reconfiguration when the garland transforms the village atmosphere. The closure lands with felt cost as "faces brighten without glare, and hands unclench." Who/where/when anchored early through grotto setting and tide markers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The grotto setting constrains choices through available materials (sea glass, slate) and shapes the method. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "petal-cool softness," "sand-smooth slate," "mist moves like gentle handwriting." The environment directly enables the solution while the cliff stairs create physical stakes for the journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of bringing safe light to a fire-wary village builds through accumulation of polished glass pieces. The tension between quick fire and patient light deepens through brother's absence and village wariness. Cost is visible in "hearts a little tired of gray days" transforming to unclenched hands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the patience/quickness dichotomy without explicit moralizing. The final image of "stringed ovals peopled by dusk and mist" offers a non-literal answer about gentleness over brilliance. Brother's potential return to "weigh the word safer against the word patient" crystallizes thematic complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm: "I circle the glass against a sand-smooth slate, then against leather, then against the worn cuff of my coat until it learns to listen." POV remains stable with consistent perceptual signature focused on texture and light. Compression serves the accumulative mode effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "I set the oval on my tongue so it takes my warmth" combines action, sensation, and ritual. Some elevated diction ("serpentine grotto," "zephyr bloom") fits the lyric mode. Minor repetition of "patient/patience" but serves thematic accumulation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh angle on light-bringing through glass polishing rather than fire-making. The specific method and materials feel organic to coastal setting. While the patience-over-haste theme is familiar, the execution through sea glass transformation offers genuine particularity.</comment>
