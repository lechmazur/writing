<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tree-song sculptor's motivation to "create music in a silent world" drives consistent micro-choices through careful touch and listening, with embodied perception ("feeling rings beneath bark"). The character's renunciation of cleverness for a simple heartbeat rhythm shows earned internal shift with visible cost—surrendering artistic ambition for communal need.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from silence to pulse to shared breath, with the porcelain insulator transforming from "mute larynx" to promise. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the sculptor leaves the music "where it belongs," accepting incompleteness as sufficient—cost visible in abandoning the symphonic vision for a simpler heartbeat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove functions as active participant with trees that "breathe, widening their pores" and store "the score inside living wood." Sensory hierarchy reflects the sculptor's profession through tactile perception of "stress cracks" and vibrations, while the porcelain insulator's transformation from telegraph remnant to musical vessel constrains the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of creating music in silence tightens when the sculptor realizes "the grove does not want a symphony; it wants a pulse," forcing trade-off between artistic ambition and communal need. The shift from complex sculpture analysis to simple heartbeat rhythm shows meaningful deepening, though cost could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of "empathy in motion" emerges through concrete acts of listening to tree memory and adjusting artistic vision to grove's needs, not abstract declaration. The final image of music left "where it belongs" while "the world remains quiet but no longer silent" offers resonant answer to the central question of how art serves community.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shows in synesthetic blending ("noise were a delicate moth," "tuning forks") and professional focus on vibration and resonance. Lyric compression works through taught pattern of musical metaphor, though some phrases like "symphonically minded" feel slightly forced rather than organic to voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The air keeps still as parchment, intensely quiet"). Some template repetition in "empathy in motion" (3x) and slight overwriting in metaphor density during quiet moments ("like sleepers adjusting quilts"), but propulsion maintains through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musical composition with tree communication avoids typical nature-mysticism through specific technical detail ("stress cracks," "porcelain insulator"). The reversal from symphony to heartbeat feels earned, though the concept of trees holding "unsung phrases" edges toward familiar territory.</comment>
