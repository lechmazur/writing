<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrator's synesthetic perception creates a distinctive sensory filter, and the ghost's genteel panic when asking to "anchor the Star" reveals vulnerability under pressure. The final promise to "return only if we can finish letting go together" shows contradictory impulses between holding on and release. However, the ghost remains somewhat archetypal despite these moments, and emotional progression feels smooth rather than contradictory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure - the mutual promise to "finish letting go together" crystallizes their shared role as caretakers of memory with visible emotional cost. The fractured timeline concept drives the central tension consistently. Minor deduction for slightly abstract handling of the "fractured timeline" mechanics which could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hedge maze that "rearranges into passages the ghost once played" functions as active setting that constrains movement and shapes the encounter. Synesthetic details like "smell green cymbals and hear gold leaves" create vivid, POV-specific perception. The orchard's responsive nature - apples "lean as if listening," pears "applaud softly" - makes environment integral to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from initial coin warning to maze navigation to timeline fractures becoming visible to the final mutual promise. The ghost's "genteel panic" when asking to anchor the Star shows genuine stakes. Cost is felt in the mother's memory and the "letting go" requirement, though the resolution feels slightly too harmonious.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of performance, memory, and release without explicit statement. The coin that "sings when held flat to the orchard" and the recurring theatrical imagery create resonant patterns. The final image of "finish letting go together" offers a non-literal answer to questions of nostalgia and presence, though it edges toward neat resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Synesthetic voice is distinctive and consistent: "smell like winter plums," "brass and gold leaves," creating a unique perceptual signature. Prose modulates effectively between lyrical description and more direct narration during the ghost's panic. No dialogue prevents full assessment of voice range, but the maintained sensory filter throughout shows strong control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines like "a gentleman of curtains and dust with eyes lit by recollection" doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in places ("hedge maze hides a mystic orchard garden where apples lean as if listening") but generally serves the accumulative texture. Minor template cadence in middle sections with repeated "I [verb]" and "He [verb]" structures.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synesthetic cashier-conductor of a theater ghost creates a fresh synthesis of elements. The specific detail of "counting tips beside these very aisles" grounds the fantastical in lived experience. The fractured timeline concept, while not entirely original, gains specificity through theatrical memory and the orchard's responsive nature.</comment>
