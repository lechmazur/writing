<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "chart grief" and create collective healing is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied actions (lacing stories to photographs, noting the mayor's joke). The character shows subtle internal complexity through "earnest whimsy" and professional calm masking personal trembles. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("transmute pain into a masterpiece") and limited internal contradiction in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the story builds through gathering testimonies and weaving them into a physical map, with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration when the community walks the corridor and speaks words of future possibility. Cost is visible in "trembling only at the places we have not named" and the case "swallowing a small future." The orientation anchors (lavender field, factory ruins, dove gray map case) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting actively shapes the ritual through lavender field rows becoming the corridor, factory ruins as "watchful elders," and sensory details (lavender/diesel ghosts, bees as "yellow punctuation"). The environment constrains choices by providing the physical space for the memory corridor. Slight elevation for how the mirror in the map case and the field's geography enable the healing process.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on collective healing after industrial decline, with escalation through the ritual's progression from individual stories to shared walking to future-oriented words. The dominant stake deepens as participants move from wringing hats to laughing to offering what they could give strangers. Cost appears in "trembling" spaces and the weight of the "small future," though agency could be stronger in the protagonist's choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of mapping grief into shared paths, with the lavender field/factory ruins embodying past and potential. The final image of learning to "memorize with your feet" offers non-literal answer to healing through embodied practice. Strong subtext in the mayor's joke about "curses into nails" and humor as "the hallway where fear forgets its shoes."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled lyricism ("wind smelled like old engines and moonlight"), though occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("transmute pain"). POV remains stable with consistent perceptual signature of noticing patterns and physical gestures. Dialogue feels natural when present (mayor's joke, single words of offering), carrying goal and subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clear prose with purposeful rhythm, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("transmute pain into a masterpiece," "collective healing prefers a path") that drift from the established voice. Some paraphrase loops ("We linger among spools and frames" followed by repetitive "as vines climb"). Information density is good in concrete scenes but weakens in conceptual passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of industrial ruin with healing ritual through specific details (photographs that "did not agree about the sky," twine and ribbon as mapping tools). The concept of a puzzle archivist creating physical corridors from memory is original. Risk-taking in the lyric approach and the unusual profession elevates within band (+0.3).</comment>
