<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's analytically intuitive nature drives concrete choices throughout, from following the tapestry's guidance to stitching through the portrait's throat. Internal contradiction surfaces effectively in "heart steaming with volcanic tenderness" and the tension between preservation through destruction. The final choice to rebuild as "a lending of breath" carries visible cost—carrying Miren's portrait as shield while keeping readers unlisted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as artistic clues build toward the revelation of hidden names and the punctuation seeds that write the city's vow. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration when seeds sprout filaments linking all elements into "a single living sentence," with clear cost in the narrator's transformation ("wholly undone"). The persistent constraint of protecting readers while preserving memory shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive's physical details—"spine of stone halls," "stair shaft choked with feathers from burned atlases," "murals shivered with salt"—constrain movement and guide discovery. The punctuation seeds and oculus create the environmental mechanism for closure. Setting functions as active participant rather than backdrop, though some descriptions edge toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to recover Miren, through discovery of the hidden ledger of names, to the larger vow of the lost civilization. The narrator's agency drives each discovery, from aligning fragment to canvas to planting seeds. Cost is visible in carrying the portrait "like a shield" and the commitment to "rebuild the library as a lending of breath."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of preservation through destruction—the arson that "loosened the old paint, so the new writing could show." The final image of seeds writing names onto wind while the narrator carries Miren's portrait reweights all prior artistic creations as a "vow kept." The piece resists simple morality about memory and protection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice employs purposeful compression and lyric accumulation ("heart steaming with volcanic tenderness," "kiln, not a bomb"). POV remains stable with consistent perceptual signature focused on patterns and artistic details. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("wholly undone," "oculus") that slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves density through compound images like "seeds that looked like punctuation" and "feathers from burned atlases." Information layers effectively in most sentences. However, some ornamental phrases ("heart steaming with volcanic tenderness") and occasional register elevation ("analytically intuitive" appears three times) create mild friction without clear pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of an arsonist who burns to preserve rather than destroy offers fresh inflection on familiar archetypes. Specific details like punctuation seeds that write names and the tapestry fragment as map avoid generic treatment. The synthesis of art, memory, and protection through destruction feels earned though not entirely unprecedented.</comment>
