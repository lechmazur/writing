<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "discover the color of sound" drives genuine interiority with embodied perception ("the water hummed, a pearly vibration tarnished at the edges with rust"). The vow at closure—"I would light the pier without tiring of attention"—represents earned renunciation with visible cost, though some passages lean toward abstract philosophizing ("I am not superstitious, but I am the sort of person who hides behind truth").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure: the protagonist surfaces "wet with a vow and a color," having internalized the library's lesson about "standing still while moving." The cost manifests as binding commitment ("It was not magic, but it was binding") with the final image reweighting the lanterns as "the very notes I had heard."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sunken library constrains and enables the central discovery—books that "woke in a glow like algae remembering lightning" when touched, creating the environment where sound gains color. Sensory detail is precise ("kelp curtains parted," "ribs of the sunken ship yawned, muttering like wet timbered bells") and the underwater setting directly shapes the protagonist's ability to perceive differently.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation reads through accumulative deepening as the protagonist moves from external observation to embodied discovery of sound's color ("a subtle not-green, not-yellow, a color like breath seen on glass"). The dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—tightens through the vow exchange, though agency remains primarily receptive rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that "Sound was a colorable weather...a slowly staining veil" earned through patient listening. The final realization that lanterns are "the very notes I had heard, more seen than sounded" offers resonant synthesis without explicit moralizing, though some passages approach abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout ("lanterns lifted from the city like careful planets," "mild star"). The lyric voice maintains consistency through compression and pattern, with rhythm modulating effectively during the underwater sequence, though occasional elevated diction strains ("meteor hush," "tethered metronome").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("I strapped my tinderbox shut, tucked my gloves, and slipped into the water with the ease of someone who has practiced leaving"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("nacre, the sort of light a shell keeps after listening to tides") and occasional abstract philosophizing dilute momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of discovering sound's literal color through underwater vow-reading offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of lamplighting duty with synaesthetic discovery feels earned, though some metaphysical passages ("I am the sort of person who hides behind truth, hoping it will shield me from its shadow") lean toward familiar territory.</comment>
