I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens - the story builds through layered imagery (shards, mirrors, tea leaves, shadows) toward a resonant reconfiguration where the library's value is recognized through accumulated gestures rather than causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation of "combative tenderness" manifests concretely through backwards walking when nervous and the specific gesture of turning cups "so the leaves find their edges." The child's transformation from bringing the shadow to reading the leaves shows earned character progression with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the council grants the stay - the library's worth is repriced through accumulated demonstration rather than argument. The cost appears in "reluctant faith" and the child hearing "themselves returning, not suddenly brave, but mentored into resilience." However, the council's transformation feels slightly underearned given the story's brevity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The forgotten library functions as active constraint - its "stacks that lean like listening elders" and floorboards that "test every retreat" shape the archivist's movement. The bottled shadow creating a "corridor like a bruise remembering light" transforms space into active participant, directly enabling the council's perception shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from the council's decree through the trial preparation to the tea ceremony confrontation. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as layers of demonstration replace argument. However, the council's reversal happens too quickly - more resistance would strengthen the earned quality of their transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of "reversible exile" - manifested in the bottled shadow's release and return, the backwards walking, and the final image of "someone trying to stay." The child's reading of tea leaves articulates theme through action rather than statement: "the grammar of staying and leaving."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice emerges through inventive constructions like "dust instructs light to fold" and "a long bottle of dusk." The perceptual signature of seeing geometry in tea leaves and walking backwards when nervous creates a unique consciousness. Prose rhythm modulates effectively between lyrical description and tense confrontation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs - "the swing outside tapping air like a metronome for missing parents" combines setting, atmosphere, and backstory. Some metaphorical density borders on overwriting ("bruise remembering light") but serves the accumulative pattern. Minor template cadence in repeated "I [verb]" constructions early on.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of an archivist practicing "reversible exile" through bottled shadows and tea-leaf geometry offers genuine freshness. The specific synthesis of bureaucratic threat with mystical archiving creates non-obvious tension. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode and invented metaphysics heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
