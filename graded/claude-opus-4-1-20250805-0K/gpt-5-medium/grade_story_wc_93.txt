I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring an Accumulative/Textural drive lens based on the lyric density and pattern-based progression toward the resonant exchange at closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to rescue his brother is clear and embodied through the "promise burning in my ribs," with the eel herder's precognitive curse creating genuine internal conflict through "the ache that followed every accuracy." The exchange of positions at closure lands with earned sacrifice, though some interior passages lean toward abstract ("promises linger like delayed thunder").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the herder's sacrifice—"for him to stay, she would have to go"—with visible cost in her "resigned grace." The accumulative lens holds as mathematical patterns and star dust build toward this exchange, though the middle section's exposition about the brother's displacement ("folded into a slick corridor") briefly strains causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tidal bluff and aurora create atmospheric pressure, with the "season after friction disappears" constraining movement throughout. The mathematical rock sequences and star dust actively shape the rescue mechanism, though some descriptions prioritize lyricism over spatial clarity ("footprints were impossible, a sketch of glimmers").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal debt to the herder's sacrifice, with the mathematical sequences creating mounting pressure toward the portal opening. The exchange—"for him to stay, she would have to go"—carries genuine cost, though the brother's predicament remains somewhat abstract until his appearance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the arithmetic of exchange and sacred patterns, culminating in "not as a rescuer, but as a listener." The final image of reading aurora "not to be saved, but to stay awake" resonantly reweights the opening's quest narrative without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with distinctive phrases like "biography of slipping" and "borrowed dawn," though density occasionally obscures clarity ("decanting a pinch into her palm"). The POV remains stable, with perceptual signature evident in how mathematical patterns are noticed and interpreted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("the sea sang like wire drawn through sky") but suffers from density issues in peak beats, with figurative language appearing in most sentences without always advancing pressure. Some passages loop conceptually ("promises linger like delayed thunder" followed by extended promise meditation), and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fusion of mathematical sequences, eel herding, and precognitive curse creates fresh synthesis, with the "season after friction disappears" offering genuine novelty. The exchange mechanism and final transformation into continuation of the herder's work feels earned and specific rather than templated.</comment>
