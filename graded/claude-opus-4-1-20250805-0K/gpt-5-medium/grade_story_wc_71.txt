I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as it builds meaning through pattern accumulation and sensory density rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" is crystal clear and drives every interaction with the houses. The final realization that "some houses feel alive because we give them our pauses" emerges naturally from accumulated observations, though the character remains somewhat abstract rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator understands that houses live through "inadvertent ritual of attention." The accumulative structure coheres beautifully as each house visit deepens understanding, with visible cost in the "trembling hands" and emotional weight of discovering the beetle tin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory work where setting constrains method—the orris shard reads houses through their displaced objects, the bay's breathing tide mirrors house rhythms. The micro-settings (spoon/cup, beetle tin) function as crucial discovery sites that enable the final insight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: from reading if houses are alive, to understanding why the second house resists, to discovering the beetle tin's patient guardianship. The final cost appears in the narrator's trembling recognition of human connection through objects.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges gorgeously through accumulated particulars—the spoon leaning toward cup, the backward clock, the hidden beetle tin all build to the insight about attention and ritual. The ending reweights every prior observation without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with phrases like "I am a creeping normality noticer" and "the bay's tide slurred the pebbles." The perceptual signature is consistent—someone who notices minute displacements and reads meaning in object relationships, maintained even under emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive prose with high information density—nearly every line advances understanding or atmosphere. Some mild figurative density ("hushed blaze," "slack golden interval") but it serves the accumulative texture without obscuring meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of reading houses through displaced objects is genuinely fresh, and the specific method (orris shard as divination tool) feels inevitable yet surprising. The synthesis of mystical practice with domestic observation creates something memorably specific.</comment>
