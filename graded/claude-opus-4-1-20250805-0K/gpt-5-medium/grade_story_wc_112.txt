I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density builds through layered scientific-poetic imagery toward a resonant reconfiguration. The sideways time concept accumulates meaning through repeated holographic/lateral imagery until the mantas' return reweights all prior material.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jae's characterization succeeds through embodied details ("hands roughened by cold," "icy warmth") and his distinctive sideways-time obsession drives concrete action. His internal contradiction between mechanic pragmatism and temporal theorist creates authentic tension. The final self-encounter ("slightly turned, slightly smiling at a different time") delivers earned complexity, though some interior moments lean toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Jae encounters his own sideways selves, reweighting the entire time theory with personal cost ("felt forgiven"). The accumulative structure coheres beautifully—each holographic/sideways image builds toward the mantas' lateral return. Minor orientation wobble around the vault sequence, but the taught pattern of sideways imagery maintains coherence throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting excels as active constraint—the magnetic nexus, solar arrays, and glide-gantries all enable or restrict key choices. The ravine where "compasses ticked like trapped insects" becomes the crucial portal. Exceptional integration of technical and poetic detail ("frost smoked off the solar arrays"). The vault's transformation into "shifting planes" directly enables the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from missing mantas through Jae's temporal theory to the rescue's personal cost. The lever pull creates genuine risk ("surge tides"), and the mantas' return validates his theory while imposing the cost of seeing his multiplied selves. Pressure coheres well under the accumulative lens, though the middle section could tighten slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the sideways time concept—reality has orthogonal dimensions we miss through linear perception. The mantas "shifted into an orthogonal now" becomes both plot mechanism and thematic statement. The ending's "choir of delayed selves" offers a non-literal answer about multiplicity of experience without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent scientific-lyric register with controlled compression ("arranged like a harp for the wind"). POV remains cleanly limited to Jae with effective perceptual signature (his tendency to hear/feel rather than see). The prose rhythm modulates effectively with pressure, though occasional abstractions ("paradoxical silence") could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Stay, he said, within the hush of beating wings at rest"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph rhythms. Some figurative density in peak moments ("architecture of delayed reflections") but it serves the accumulative pattern. Minor abstract moments but no loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sideways time concept offers genuine freshness—mantas migrating through orthogonal time dimensions is memorably specific. The synthesis of hard SF concepts with lyrical nature writing creates distinctive texture. Risk-taking in the experimental structure and the self-encounter ending heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
