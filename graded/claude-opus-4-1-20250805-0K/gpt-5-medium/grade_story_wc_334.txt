<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to recover grandmother's stolen memories drives concrete underwater exploration with embodied fear ("breath bead on the lens") and culminates in a earned trade—admitting she "loved the work more than the woman who held my anchor rope." The cost lands viscerally through the glove filling "with warmth not mine" and recovered memory of grandmother's laughter, though some interiority edges toward reflection without immediate embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens coheres through pattern accumulation ("broken constellations," recurring apple imagery, ledger motif) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist writes grandmother's name "a third time, my correction, stubborn as salt"—accepting partial recovery rather than full restoration. The confession about loving work more than relationship crystallizes the cost, and "crisp nostalgia sharpened the day" signals earned transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse with "iron ribs furred with kelp" and preserved apples "small moons wearing a rust blush" creates a visceral underwater archive that constrains movement and enables discovery. The fairy ring mushroom circle actively receives the protagonist's confession and brightens in response, while broken constellation patterns in the ceiling guide the search—environment as active participant rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from general memory recovery to the specific confession requirement ("feed the ring the missing truth"), forcing the protagonist to voice what she's "avoided for years." The brightening ring and warming glove provide tangible response to her admission, though the middle section could tighten between discovery and confession.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and loss—the sea as "archive" that requires payment, memories "tithed, pressed like cider into the quiet." The final image of writing grandmother's name "a third time" reweights the opening's "chronically curious" folklorist as someone learning to accept partial truths, though one instance of "women make its ledger" edges toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends academic precision ("chronically curious," "detect patterns") with poetic compression ("The tide list on my wrist was smudged with salt and graphite"). The perceptual signature holds through stress—"A gull drifted through the roof and became a smudge"—and grandmother's voice arrives "as bubbles that cracked into syllables," maintaining underwater physicality throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Decades later still felt like yesterday here, because the light remembered how to touch the glass"). Minor repetition of "decades later" and some filter constructions ("I could detect") slightly reduce immediacy, but prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful fragments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse as memory archive transforms the treasure-hunt trope through specific detail—apples preserved in brine, shipwrecks as "ribs like barred windows." The fairy ring mushroom underwater and memories requiring confession as payment create fresh synthesis, though the core folklorist-investigates-mystery frame remains somewhat familiar.</comment>
