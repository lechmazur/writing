<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's dual identity as "crisis actor real crisis survivor" creates compelling internal contradiction that drives choices throughout, particularly in the shift from performed victim to active archivist. The "benevolently ruthless" trait manifests concretely in cutting away apologies while steadying shaking elbows. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("scripts inside me loosening") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as footstep-words accumulate into a communal archive, with closure showing the narrator's transformation from victim to nomadic witness. The final image of traveling "with the nomadic penumbra, following where small gestures shine" reconfigures the opening's "luminous absence" with clear cost (leaving behind stability). Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, though the conceptual density occasionally obscures immediate causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery functions as more than setting—its acoustic properties enable the central method of footstep-writing, with marble carrying voices "like a patient river." The chessboard's missing pawns constrains choices (people must stand as pawns). The "nomadic penumbra" created by the swinging lantern shapes movement patterns and the final departure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual gesture-archiving to collective participation as strangers spell "water," "stay," "hear/here," building communal memory against the backdrop of potential "new orders." The widow's button becoming a "comet" pointing toward newcomers deepens the stakes. Cost is visible in "shaking elbows," "smiled without teeth," and the final choice to leave rather than be governed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between loud colonizing headlines and "small gestures," between official scripts and embodied memory. The final image of following "where small gestures shine" resonantly answers the central question of how to preserve authentic experience during political upheaval without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("I had been the crisis actor real crisis survivor") and purposeful compression. The perceptual signature shows selective attention to gesture and sound over visual detail. Minor dialogue effectively carries subtext ("kings come later, if at all"). Some register elevation in peak moments slightly exceeds the POV's established range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in gesture descriptions that advance both action and theme. Some paraphrase loops appear ("unbind the record from spectacle...bind it to your smallest rescue"). Template cadence emerges in the spelling sequence but serves the pattern. Mixed metaphor tension between "nomadic penumbra" as shadow and as traveling companion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The footstep-writing method is genuinely inventive, transforming the familiar workshop/testimony genre through embodied choreography. The "crisis actor real crisis survivor" paradox offers fresh perspective on trauma performance. The piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative mode without retreating to conventional narrative.</comment>
