I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and symbolic density rather than strict causal chains, culminating in a resonant choice.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict between escaping fate and preserving the keeper crystallizes beautifully in contradictory impulses: "all my neatly inventive pieces arguing softly." The final choice carries visible cost—forsaking the unbroken mornings for human connection. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("bleak exhilaration rip through me") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist chooses "the keeper, the unbroken tide" over stepping beyond fate, with clear opportunity cost. The accumulative build through yoyo mechanics, blood offering, and vision threads coheres well. Slight dock for the vision sequence feeling rushed relative to the careful build-up.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hunger stone and ancient yoyo constrain choices excellently—the protagonist must reverse-engineer the puzzle to access the door. Setting details like "stones around its base sweated salt and secrets" and the chamber that "opened like a throat" create visceral atmosphere. The lighthouse-as-body metaphor ("breathed") charges the final moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: lantern descent → puzzle solving → blood offering → vision of futures → final choice. The cost materializes clearly in the three timeline visions, especially "the keeper's death for my trespass." The protagonist's agency drives each deepening, with visible price in forsaking the room of unbroken mornings.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the tension between control and connection—the clockmaker who "kept time against the grain" ultimately chooses human bonds over mastery of fate. The final image of letting "the yoyo climb" while choosing "the unbroken tide" offers a non-literal answer about accepting fate's design when it preserves what matters.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "a counter clockwise clock maker who kept time against the grain of consolation." The perceptual signature remains consistent—technical precision mixed with poetic observation. Slight compression under stress works ("threads snuffing"). No head-hopping, clean focalization throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "My hands, neatly inventive, smelled of brass and boat pitch, and of the regret my tools could not file smooth." Some metaphor density in places ("blade of fog," "iron aftertaste") but serves the accumulative mode. Minor dock for occasional abstraction ("bleak exhilaration") and one filter-heavy sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The reverse-engineering clockmaker studying a hunger stone creates fresh synthesis—time manipulation through mechanical precision meeting ancient mysticism. The yoyo-as-key mechanism and the choice between temporal mastery and human connection feels inevitable yet surprising. Risk-taking in the lyric density pays off (+0.3).</comment>
