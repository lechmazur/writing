I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows a clear because/therefore linkage as Elias uses Thorne's artifacts to decode a scientific mystery, with each discovery narrowing options toward the final revelation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his myth-buster identity transformed into truth-seeking obsession. The internal tension between his scientific skepticism and belief in Thorne's work creates authentic contradiction. His final "gloomy cheerfulness" embodies complex emotion at discovering a lifelong task. Minor deduction for slight emotional summary in "wave of gloomy cheerfulness washed over him."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal structure with clear Decisive Change when the ephemeral compass manifests and points to the floor, revealing Thorne's true discovery. The cost is legible - Elias faces a "possibly lifelong" task with no public validation. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraph. Closure lands with visible cost under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned observatory functions as more than backdrop - its "crumbling dome" and "grime-caked dome slit" constrain the experiment while the dust motes become the compass itself. Setting actively shapes the discovery when the dust forms "a needle of light." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("ozone and anticipation"). Doesn't quite reach 9+ as the environment could constrain choices more forcefully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake - decoding Thorne's discovery - escalates through precise calibration of the cello's frequency until it "locks in," creating the ephemeral compass. The tightening occurs when Elias must accept a private truth over public validation. Cost is clear: forsaking "grant proposals and television appearances" for an invisible, lifelong pursuit. Agency drives every beat through Elias's experimental choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between public myth-busting and private truth-seeking. The seashell and cello create resonant meaning about finding "significance" over space. The final realization that Thorne sought "terrestrial location where a cosmic event had left its invisible, resonant scar" reweights the entire search. Slight deduction for the somewhat explicit "what if the typos were the entire point?" which edges toward theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("dust motes dancing in the slanted moonlight his only audience"). POV remains stable and modest to Elias's knowledge. Prose modulates effectively during the experiment's climax. Minor issues with occasional filter verbs ("He pictured," "He remembered") that could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is solid - most lines advance multiple purposes. Some redundancy in "Silence, profound and absolute" and occasional overwriting ("glorious, crumbling dome"). The "gloomy cheerfulness" construction feels slightly forced. No major loops or scaffolding, but could achieve greater concision in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of an "ephemeral compass" for navigating "significance" offers a fresh angle on scientific discovery. Using a half-finished cello and painted seashell as experimental apparatus is inventive. The transformation of myth-busting into truth-restoration provides originality. However, the "lone scientist vindicated" arc follows familiar patterns without fully transforming them through lived detail.</comment>
