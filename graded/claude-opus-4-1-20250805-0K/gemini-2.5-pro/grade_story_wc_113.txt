I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as the piece builds through layers of water imagery, stains, and dissolution toward a resonant reconfiguration where the ghost's music emerges through water damage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—his "strange creative fever" drives concrete actions from studying stains to lowering the program into water. The decisive choice to "disrupt the placid surface" shows internal contradiction resolved through action with visible cost (destroying the artifact). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("wordless conversation") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where water transforms the program into readable music, paying off the setup perfectly. The cost is visible—the "ruined, transformed artifact" that Elias must preserve in a sleeve. The accumulative lens holds as water imagery builds from "dark mirror" to "water damage creating images" to final dissolution that reveals the ghost's message.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The flooded opera house functions as more than setting—water becomes the active medium that both destroyed and preserves the ghost's message. Vivid sensory detail ("damp velvet," "skeletal ribs of the upper balconies") creates atmosphere while the water itself constrains and enables the final revelation, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from passive study ("frustratingly incomplete") to active disruption ("too passive, too reverent") to decisive action. The cost is clear—destroying the antique program to receive its message. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias realizes "the spirit wasn't just in the water-damaged paper, it was in the water itself."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the water motif—destruction as preservation, ruin as medium. The final image of Elias carrying the "ghost's last breath" into "the living city" offers a non-literal answer about art transcending tragedy. Strong subtext in "a night he'd heard whispers about" and the unspoken tragedy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm that modulates from contemplative ("silent companion") to urgent ("heart hammering"). Strong perceptual signature in how Elias reads water damage as musical notation. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("profound and resonant quiet") that slightly exceeds the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("skeletal ribs of the upper balconies"). Some redundancy in "profound and resonant quiet" and mild overwriting in "trembling light, making the shadows dance like wraiths." Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple purposes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh angle on ghost story through water as medium of communication rather than traditional haunting. The specific mechanism of capillary action revealing music through ink dissolution is inventive. The synthesis of opera tragedy, water damage, and musical revelation feels organic and earned.</comment>
