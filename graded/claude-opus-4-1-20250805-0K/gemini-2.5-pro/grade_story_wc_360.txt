I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category against publishability standards.

**Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through density of metaphor and pattern, culminating in Anya's grief being transformed into a geometric symbol, a Conceptual Repricing that recontextualizes rather than resolves her emotion.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to understand emotion's "fundamental mathematics" drives consistent choices through borrowing, transposing, and abstracting. Anya's grief embodiment is specific ("clutched a small, worn photograph"). The transformation from feeling to shape lands with visible disorientation as cost, though Elias's emotional opacity after the initial mirroring slightly limits depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where grief becomes "the shape of it" with clear cost ("unbearable weight...had not disappeared, but...recontextualized"). The accumulative lens holds as metaphysical elements layer toward the final transformation. Cost is legible in Anya's disorientation and Elias's return to enigmatic distance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The topaz walls that "catch dying stars" and the letterpress as cosmic instrument constrain the transformation ritual. The halo fragment focuses power through "brass-and-crystal lens." Setting actively participates in closure as "topaz walls seemed to vibrate" during the transposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: borrowing personality → focusing halo fragment → pulling lever → experiencing grief as equation. The transformation imposes clear cost (Anya's disorientation), though the conflict lacks a meaningful resistance point or complication that would deepen agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The final symbol as "fractal of impossible angles" brilliantly embodies the theme of emotion's hidden mathematics without stating it. "Not the feeling of it, but the shape of it" resonates as perfect non-literal answer. The piece earns its conceptual repricing through accumulated specifics rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature in "dry rasp that mimicked the woman's unshed tears" and Elias experiencing sorrow as "complex, elegant equation." Voice modulates effectively from cryptic distance to borrowed empathy. Minor dock for slight register elevation ("singularity," "perfect, unbroken curve") that occasionally strains POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("walls...catching light...like honey in a jar"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("lucid turbulence," "vortex") without full payoff. Clean prose momentum with varied syntax, though "unbearable weight" is slightly stock for this otherwise fresh diction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The letterpress as emotion-geometry translator offers genuine freshness. "Transposed empathy" as experiencing another's feeling through mathematical equations is highly original. The fractal symbol as grief's shape transforms the familiar workshop of emotion trope through specific conceptual rigor.</comment>
