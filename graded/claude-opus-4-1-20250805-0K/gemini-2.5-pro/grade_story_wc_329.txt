<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clearly rooted and intensifies through the discovery of the locust shell and her experimental method of heart-rhythm synchronization. The final choice to risk confronting the Wardens shows genuine cost, though internal contradiction could be more viscerally embodied during the climactic moment rather than summarized as "fear and hope."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the orchard transforms from mechanical control to chaotic beauty with visible cost (the Wardens absorbed). The locust shell discovery provides causal linkage, and the heart-rhythm method constrains tactics effectively. Minor deduction for slightly rushed pacing in the transformation sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The orchard setting actively constrains choice through the Wardens' patrols and the Mother Tree as focal point. Sensory details like "apple blossoms the color of old bruises" and "bark scaled like a dragon" create vivid atmosphere that supports the tarnished wonder tone. The environment directly shapes the climactic confrontation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal desire to direct confrontation with the Wardens, with clear cost when vines reclaim the statues. The protagonist's agency drives the transformation through her chosen method, though the Wardens' response could show more adaptive pressure before their absorption.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast of mechanical certainty versus chaotic growth, with the locust shell as perfect metaphor for transformation. The ending's "fierce, chaotic, and breathtakingly real" beauty offers resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting the entire orchard through absorption rather than destruction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled lyricism ("gossamer sky-bridge," "Orchard of Sighs") that maintains consistency. The perceptual signature shows in selective details like how she experiences the shell's "faint thrum." Minor deduction for slight register elevation in places like "atoms of the air" that edges toward overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "weave her own life into the melody." Some figurative density in peak beats ("riot of pinks and whites," "intoxicating perfume of freedom") and occasional register drift ("systematically bled dry"). The final paragraph contains multiple abstract descriptors that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music-as-rebellion with the specific heart-rhythm method and locust shell catalyst. The transformation through absorption rather than destruction offers non-obvious resolution. The orchard's specific details (bruised blossoms, granite Wardens) elevate beyond generic enchanted forest.</comment>
