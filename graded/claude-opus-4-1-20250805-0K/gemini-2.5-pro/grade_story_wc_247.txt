<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to translate silence into music through his unique ritual is clear and compelling, with Lyra's whispered guidance adding internal tension. The character's "quietly charismatic grace" manifests convincingly when the security guard becomes mesmerized. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of his internal conflict—the emotional cost of his art could be more embodied in the peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through mapping different silences until the climactic disruption at the ferry landing creates a Resonant Reconfiguration—the harbor's silence transforms into "unending song." The cost is felt in "the sorrow of their loss and the joy of their music resting together in his heart." The orientation anchors (who, where, when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The luminous harbor setting actively shapes Elian's choices—each location (pylons, bench, ferry landing) offers different qualities of silence to map. The "aggressive" silence beneath the collapsed pier becomes the crucial constraint forcing his most passionate composition. Sensory details like "leather casing cool against his cheek" and "silvered water" are selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from mapping ordinary silence to confronting the "aggressive presence" at the ferry landing that "pushed back against the moonlight." The deepening occurs as Elian moves from documentation to "arguing, pleading, demanding that the silence give up its dead." Cost manifests in the physical intensity of his "desperate, beautiful ballet" and the emotional weight of giving voice to the forgotten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of translating absence into presence—Elian ensures the forgotten "would never be truly silent again." The recurring motif of silence deepens from "profound quiet" to "crushing stillness" to finally becoming "filled with a quiet, unending song." The "joyful sorrow" tone crystallizes perfectly in the final image without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "rippling sheet of silver" and "spectral symphony" that match Elian's artistic sensibility. The perceptual signature shows in how he experiences silence as textured and mappable. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("nexus," "amnesia") that slightly exceeds the established voice range during non-peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and information density, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Some metaphorical density in high-pressure beats ("divining rod for oblivion," "hole in the world") without clear pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears briefly ("He framed... He mapped... He clicked") but doesn't pervade.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of photographing absence with a filmless camera to create music from silence offers genuine originality. The invented sign language notation system and the transformation of forgotten histories into embodied sound create a unique synthesis. Risk-taking in the abstract premise pays off through concrete sensory grounding (+0.3 within band).</comment>
