<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("feral nostalgia gnawed at me, a longing so sharp and savage it felt like a physical hunger") and genuine internal contradiction between past and present selves. The jealousy of past selves creates layered psychological complexity. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract resolution of seeing "all the warring pieces of himself as a single, coherent story" which edges toward therapeutic clarity rather than earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the flight experience reconfigures the narrator's relationship to his fractured timeline. Cost is legible in the shift from "feral nostalgia" to "strange, quiet awe" and the acceptance of the "fractured narrative." Orientation anchors (mountain cabin, chronicler role) established early. Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the temporal confusion which never fully crystallizes into specific dramatic stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail ("charcoal stick crumbled against the fragile grain," "sunlight, thick with dust motes") and the cabin setting constrains the narrator physically while enabling the imaginative flight. The birch bark scroll functions as micro-setting. However, the mountain/forest environment doesn't actively pressure choices beyond providing the launch point for flight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconciling with temporal fracture—deepens through the jealousy sequence and culminates in the flight that shifts perspective. The internal pressure builds from nostalgia to frustration to transcendent acceptance. Limited by the primarily internal nature of the conflict without external pressures that would force harder choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete struggle with time and identity, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of charting a "landscape" rather than fighting "chaos" offers resonant reframing without stating a thesis. The recurring motif of writing/chronicling gains meaning as it shifts from "triage" to "artistry."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled rhythm that modulates from contemplative to urgent during the flight sequence. Strong metaphorical consistency ("distill chaos into narrative"). The voice maintains coherence through the trance/flight without losing the narrator's core texture, though some phrases edge toward writerly abstraction ("chronologically confused state").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("psychic wreckage," "chronologically confused state") and slight overwriting in metaphorical passages that occasionally prioritize poetry over clarity. The "strange and fractured narrative" ending risks abstraction but maintains enough specificity to land.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream chronicling with temporal confusion creates genuine originality. The jealousy toward past selves and the transformation of that jealousy through aerial perspective offers non-obvious emotional truth. The risk of the waking flight/trance sequence heightens stakes while maintaining coherence.</comment>
