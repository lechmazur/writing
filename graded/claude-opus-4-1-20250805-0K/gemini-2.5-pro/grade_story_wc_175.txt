<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—honoring overlooked histories through ephemeral monuments. His internal contradiction between realism ("knew that great engine had already ground to a halt") and ritualistic action creates authentic complexity. The final choice to build despite futility shows earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-break closure when the last butterfly passes through. The Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) lands with felt cost: "a different kind of quiet now, one of fulfillment." The piece teaches its ritual pattern early and pays it off through the final architectural sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grotto setting actively shapes choices—Elias must work with available materials (silvervine, river stones) and the floating island's edge creates natural boundaries. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "damp moss cool against his worn trousers." The moth wing functions as micro-setting that constrains his memorial design.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation follows accumulative logic: each structure builds toward the "culminating knot" as butterflies arrive in diminishing numbers. The dominant stake (honoring the migration's end) tightens through the "sparse, hesitant trickle" that forces Elias to work faster. Cost is visible in the acceptance of ending: "built a soft place for it to land."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—temporary structures mirror the transient nature of what they commemorate. The moth wing as "data, an ancient schematic" avoids sentimentality while honoring loss. The final image of structures "dissolving back into the green" offers resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elias sees the world through "hidden grammar" and translates flyways into knots. Voice modulates effectively from contemplative opening to urgent action ("his hands a blur"). The prose maintains literary register appropriate to the character's scholarly sensibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some figurative density in opening paragraph ("cradle of impossible green," "blushing stillness") but serves to establish tone. Syntax varies naturally with scene needs, accelerating during construction sequence. Minor scaffold in "transiently rooted" repetition but doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of building ephemeral monuments for Earth's memory rather than human witness offers fresh angle on extinction narrative. Specific synthesis of ecological loss with artistic ritual avoids generic environmental tragedy. The moth wing as "data" not magic shows originality within the memorial tradition.</comment>
