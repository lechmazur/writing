I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category rigorously.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered cosmic imagery and pattern recognition toward a resonant reconfiguration where Kael's purpose inverts from future-seeker to past-curator.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to "wavelength align with purpose" drives consistent choices through coin-casting ritual to final revelation. His "stellar doubt" creates genuine internal tension. The transformation from seeking the new universe's voice to becoming curator of the old shows earned character arc with visible cost—his life's work reconceptualized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost: Kael discovers his purpose inverted—not charting the future but preserving the past. The "uncoin the void" prophecy pays off perfectly, reweighting all prior distillation work. Who/where/when anchored early ("observatory deck," "ambered field"). Accumulative lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "crush of bruised light and screaming physics" establishes vivid cosmic setting. The ambered observatory constrains choices (power limitations, sensor fragility). Sensory hierarchy reflects Kael's professional focus—static bursts, filtering algorithms, console hums. The copper coin's physical detail ("green with age") grounds the abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from interpreting static to risking total sensor burnout on the stubborn pulse. The coin ritual creates genuine decision point with consequences. Cost manifests in dissolving "stellar doubt" and accepting his transformed purpose—years of forward-seeking work recontextualized as backward-looking.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The "uncoin the void" prophecy brilliantly inverts expectation—spending the past to purchase the past. Theme emerges through concrete discovery rather than assertion: memory preservation versus future-seeking. The final curator role offers resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting his entire endeavor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice balances technical precision ("filtering algorithms," "sensor dish") with lyrical cosmic description. POV remains tightly controlled through Kael's perceptual filter. "Quietly enthusiastic about the end of all things" perfectly captures his unusual perspective. Some register elevation in peak moments but serves the cosmic scope.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong momentum, though some density issues: "crush of bruised light and screaming physics" borders on overwriting. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. The prophecy text integration feels slightly artificial but pays off. Minor redundancy in "stellar doubt" descriptions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic apocalypse with archaeological preservation. The "cast lots decision maker" philosophy and coin ritual create specific, memorable character trait. The inversion from future-seeking to past-curating genuinely surprises while feeling inevitable. Risk-taking with compressed universe setting pays off.</comment>
