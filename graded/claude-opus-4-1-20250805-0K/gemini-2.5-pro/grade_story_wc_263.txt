I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and meditation toward a conceptual repricing of Elara's affliction.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's psychic burden manifests through concrete embodied details ("fingers stained with brass polish and starlight") and her transformation from seeking escape to embracing connection feels earned. The shift from viewing unspoken words as "crushing static" to "verses of her new and wondrous song" demonstrates genuine character evolution through specific experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves Conceptual Repricing when Elara reconceptualizes human suffering as "lament of forgotten stardust," transforming her relationship to her affliction with clear cost—years of isolation. The accumulative structure builds through astronomical observation to cosmic insight, though the revelation paragraph relies slightly on telling rather than dramatization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway and astronomical instrument create a vivid micro-setting that constrains choice—Elara must trace meteors to find peace. Sensory details like "wind-hewn archway of black basalt" and "plates of smoked glass" ground the ethereal concept, though some descriptions ("moonstruck dreamer") lean generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding mental quiet versus embracing psychic noise—deepens when the meteor's brightness triggers Elara's revelation. The cost of years of isolation ("fifth major shower since the twin-tailed visitor") is visible, though the transformation occurs through insight rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of cosmic interconnection emerges organically through the stardust metaphor without explicit moralizing. The final image of Elara sketching valley faces beautifully reweights her affliction from curse to creative gift, avoiding tidy resolution while maintaining thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Elara's contemplative nature, with effective modulation during the revelation sequence. Some phrases like "shadowed rapture" and "moonstruck dreamer" feel slightly overwrought, but the voice coheres around astronomical and mystical imagery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative phrases like "soul-scribe" and "ancestral echo from before she was human." However, the revelation paragraph contains abstract telling ("It was not a thought, but a memory she had never lived") and some elevated diction borders on purple ("incandescent arc," "ecstatic clarity").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of psychic sensitivity as cosmic homesickness offers a fresh angle on telepathic affliction. The astronomical instrument as "soul-scribe" and the specific detail of tracking meteor showers since "the twin-tailed visitor" create memorable particularity beyond genre conventions.</comment>
