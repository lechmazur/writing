I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric for a 600-800 word piece.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through sensory detail and memory toward a resonant moment where Elias's quiet method succeeds.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's contradiction between belief in whispers and the immense internal force he channels reads authentic. The transition from "agony of love" to "screaming tenderness" embodies genuine emotional complexity. Minor deduction for the captain's overly articulate response that doesn't reflect stress ("The fog was absolute").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - the ship's salvation validates Elias's method with visible cost (his exhaustion implied). The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward the final proof. The captain's garden reference elegantly confirms the mechanism without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse lens as "filter for the heart" constrains Elias's choice beautifully. Sensory hierarchy reflects his priorities - the cork's faint scent over Hemlock's roaring. Minor deduction: "cobalt lighthouse" feels decorative rather than lived-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's internal intensification from holding the cork to channeling "the full, silent force of his spirit." The cost manifests in his physical/emotional expenditure. The opposition between Hemlock's failed method and Elias's untested approach creates genuine pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the whispers/shouts dichotomy without moralizing. The final image of fog "burned away not by a horn's blast, but by the quiet, unstoppable force of a whisper" offers resonant closure that reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elias's focus on "smaller things" and sensory memories. Some register drift occurs ("nascent dawn," "immense it threatened to tear him apart") that doesn't match the established quiet voice. Dialogue limited but the captain's voice feels slightly too polished.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Deductions for overwriting: "predawn bruise of purple and indigo," "testament to a lifetime," and the abstract "raw vibrations of intent." Some template phrasing in "Minutes stretched into an eternity." Information density could be higher in the middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse lens as emotional amplifier offers a fresh angle on the beacon concept. The synthesis of scent-memory with navigation feels specific. However, the setup relies on familiar lighthouse-keeper dynamics and the mystical lens concept borders on convenient magic.</comment>
