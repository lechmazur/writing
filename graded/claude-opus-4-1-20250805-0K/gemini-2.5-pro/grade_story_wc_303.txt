I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is a **Causal** story - Elias's discovery through plant telepathy causes his decision to expose the truth and propagate the vine cutting, with clear because/therefore linkage throughout.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority with the "mulberry ache" embodying Elias's moral conflict, and his final choice to trade "an empire for a single green stem" shows clear cost. The contradictory impulses between comfort and truth act simultaneously in scene. Minor deduction for slight emotional smoothness in the transition from discovery to action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Decisive Change lands with visible cost - Elias abandons his career for truth, leaving his report exposing the violin's true provenance. The causal chain from plant memory to coffee prophecy to final action is tight. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established early and the "wounded soil" image charges the closure with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observatory's refrigerated air contrasts with warm coffee, the Cyphandra vine constrains choice through its telepathic revelation, and sensory details like "velvet drape" and "chilled marble" create atmosphere. The vine functions as micro-setting that directly shapes the decisive turn. Slight deduction for limited spatial choreography beyond the central pedestal area.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear escalation from comfortable complicity to moral crisis through the vine's memory and coffee prophecy convergence. The stake of "authenticating these elegant brutalities" tightens when Elias must choose between prestige and truth, with visible cost in abandoning his career. The "fertile pang of planting something true" shows the price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between "elegant brutalities" and living memory, with the vine cutting as resistance to empire. The "perforated destiny" in coffee grounds offers a non-literal answer to whether truth or power prevails. The final image of "planting something true in wounded soil" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with phrases like "mulberry ache" and "leafy ghosts," maintaining consistent psychic distance. The perceptual signature shows in how Elias notices "dark green hands" and reads futures in coffee stains. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in "chronometric data" that briefly breaks POV consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "a tear frozen into music" and varied sentence structure. However, some overwriting appears ("sprawling lattice," "elegant brutalities") and mild template cadence in the middle section ("He had to...He sipped...He lifted"). The paraphrase loop of "choice" concepts in the penultimate paragraph creates minor redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empire critique through botanical telepathy and coffee divination creates an unexpected angle. The "transparent violin" as frozen tear and the vine cutting as revolution seed show originality. The risk of making plant telepathy central to moral awakening pays off through specific execution.</comment>
