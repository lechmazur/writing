<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation crystallizes through embodied action—his economical movements and peripheral awareness technique show rather than tell his character. The "strangely honest" trait manifests in his direct confrontation of distortion and his willingness to act alone. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "whisperfield calm" mental state lacking more concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure—Kael successfully preserves the prophet's wisdom in the conjured clearing, a Decisive Change with visible cost (the "staggering mental weight"). The spiral descent, machine activation, and consecration sequence builds causally. Orientation anchors (pavilion, three days after prophet, dunes) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet's obsidian lenses and interlocking rings constrain Kael's method—requiring peripheral awareness rather than force—directly shaping the climactic choice. The sun-bleached leviathan rib marker and the dune's "hissing" retraction create vivid sensory specificity. Setting actively guides the consecration through its mechanical requirements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds from verbal distortion to physical journey to psychic consecration, with the "staggering mental weight" providing clear cost at closure. The stakes deepen as Kael moves from witnessing corruption to actively preserving truth through the ancient machine. One meaningful tightening that forecloses the path of passive observation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between the pavilion's "tapestry of doubt" and the "conjured clearing" of preserved truth—no explicit moralizing. The final image of truth "sheltered in a silent clearing beneath the sand" resonantly answers the question of preservation versus distortion. Slight deduction for the prophet's teachings being somewhat abstract ("compassion as a force of nature").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Kael's focus on geometry ("slight curve in their straightest lines of logic") and his peripheral awareness technique. Voice maintains consistency through measured, precise diction matching his methodical nature. The "murmuring" and "whisper" motifs create rhythmic coherence without becoming mechanical.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clean prose with varied sentence structures and strong verbs ("hissed and retracted," "coalesced"). Information density high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("resonant truth," "absolute stillness") and slight overwriting in the consecration moment ("staggering mental weight," "profound rightness").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The peripheral awareness technique and kinetic parapet offer fresh angles on preserving wisdom. The specific detail of the half-mask and line walker order creates memorable texture. However, the prophet/disciple framework and preservation-of-truth theme are familiar territory, transformed but not radically reimagined.</comment>
