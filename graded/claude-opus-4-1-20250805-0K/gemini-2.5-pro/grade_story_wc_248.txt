<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's contradictory impulses—volcanic rage cooled to diamond resolve—act simultaneously in scene, particularly in his transformation from destroyer to curator. The final choice to create rather than destroy is earned through the discovery of Elara's anticipatory art, with visible emotional cost ("tenderness so fierce it threatened to crack his ribs").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through layered discoveries (tapestry, carvings, constellation, vandalized portrait) to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kaelen's purpose transforms from revenge to creation. The cost is legible in his shift from "arsonist who had destroyed" to "curator of a true one," though the transformation feels slightly rushed in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive setting actively constrains and enables choices—the basalt walls hold clues, the preserved chamber protects the final work, and ancient pigments provide tools for restoration. The fissure in the rock enabling the light projection is particularly effective, though some spatial transitions between chambers could be clearer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating discoveries that deepen Kaelen's connection to his sister, culminating in the revelation that she anticipated and incorporated vandalism into her art. The cost is visible in his transformation from destructive rage to creative purpose, though the final beat could tighten the trade-off between revenge and restoration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of erasure versus preservation emerges organically through Elara's hidden art trail and her final piece that transforms vandalism into testimony. The ending offers a resonant answer—creation as the true counter to erasure—without stating a moral, effectively reweighting the opening's destructive act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register with distinctive perceptual signatures ("dust-choked silence," "necropolis of forgotten knowledge"), though some passages drift toward overwriting. The metaphorical density occasionally obscures clarity, particularly "volcanic heat cooling into resolve as hard as diamond."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments but suffers from figurative density that slows momentum—nearly every sentence in emotional beats contains metaphor or elevated diction. Template patterns appear ("He found...," "He moved...," "He remembered...") and some metaphors strain credibility (tenderness as both weapon and bedrock).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of an artist incorporating anticipated vandalism into her work offers genuine freshness, as does the transformation of an arsonist into a curator. The specific synthesis of destruction and creation feels earned, though some elements (star-nosed mole carving) feel arbitrary rather than inevitable.</comment>
