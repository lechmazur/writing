<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with Kaelen's "hollowed-out look" and Elara's careful, non-invasive care creating genuine character pressure. The amber pendant choice crystallizes competing impulses (fossil vs. flow) with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstraction in "watchful dreamer by nature" and "protected vulnerability" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the dripping water pattern serving as the decisive turning point that enables Elara's gesture. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Kaelen's understanding shifts from "acceptance of its grim prison" to "understanding of the choice," with emotional cost visible in his "first [breath] that didn't sound like a prelude to shattering." Orientation anchors (server farm, Elara, Kaelen) established early and maintained throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The moss-covered server farm creates genuine constraint—the humidity Elara maintains, the dripping ice pattern on slate that enables the thematic turn. Setting actively participates in closure through "new life growing on old failures." Some generic phrases ("honeyed hush," "soft weight") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: Elara's patient tending, the emerging ice pattern, then her decisive choice to offer the pendant with its reframed meaning. The cost is legible in Kaelen's response and the "fertile ground" that replaces his isolation. The single meaningful deepening (pattern recognition to action) fits the 600-word scope well.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the fossil/flow dichotomy without explicit moralizing. The final image of "fertile ground" resonantly answers whether transformation is possible after public failure. The amber pendant and water pattern work as genuine thematic vehicles, not ornaments.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with Elara's perceptual signature evident in how she reads patterns and tends growth. Dialogue is minimal but effective ("This is how they see you"). Some elevated diction ("honeyed hush," "watchful dreamer") creates minor register drift from the otherwise grounded voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Deductions for overwrought opening ("honeyed hush...soft weight"), some abstraction ("protected vulnerability"), and occasional purple patches. The clarity at closure remains strong despite these frictions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The moss garden in a server farm offers a fresh setting, and the fossil-vs-flow metaphor transforms the familiar redemption arc. The specific detail of tracking moisture patterns on slate adds originality. Some safety in the resolution's optimism prevents higher scoring.</comment>
