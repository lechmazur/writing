<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's steadily curious nature drives concrete choices under pressure, particularly the leap of faith to test his discovery. His internal contradictions play out in scene ("no sense building a church if you're afraid to pray") and the final choice carries visible cost—risking death over the acid sea. Minor deduction for some label-speak ("stubbornly steady curious nature") but embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure elevate the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-break closure when the glider "grips" reality itself, creating a Decisive Change with felt cost (risking death over acid). The yearning algorithm concept builds through kaleidoscope observations to the "Grip" revelation, causally driving the modification and test flight. Orientation anchors (workshop, acid sea, Kaelen) establish early. The closure lands with undeniable transformation—from falling to holding—though cost could be slightly more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gears-and-cogs workshop and acid sea create genuine constraints—the corroded launch platform and "hungry" acid below raise stakes for the test flight. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (green vapors glowing with twin suns, the hiss of the sea). The modified wing's "non-Euclidean configuration" and the final suspended state charge the closure image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from intellectual curiosity to life-risking test flight, with the acid sea as lethal consequence. The "Grip" discovery creates a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge and options. Agency drives the climax—Kaelen chooses to test his theory despite mortal danger. The cost is legible (potential death) though the resolution arrives somewhat quickly after the crisis moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the Yearning Algorithm concept—the universe's drive toward complexity and discovery. The bell metaphor ("ring a bell no one hears yet") resonates at closure when Kaelen achieves his breakthrough in isolation. The final image of him suspended above toxic waters offers a non-literal answer about pioneering knowledge. Slight deduction for the algorithm concept being somewhat abstractly stated rather than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct voice with inventive diction ("beautiful disaster," "sacrilegious joy") and consistent POV control. Perceptual signature shows in how Kaelen interprets cosmic patterns through mechanical lens. Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("non-Euclidean configuration") slightly strains the tinkerer's lexicon. Dialogue (self-directed) feels natural and goal-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high—most lines advance story, character, or atmosphere. Some figurative density in places ("fossilized command," "crystalline grammar") and occasional elevated diction. Minor scaffold in explaining the algorithm concept. The final paragraph's rhythm effectively builds to the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk aesthetics with cosmic philosophy creates memorable world. The "Yearning Algorithm" as universe's open-source code is inventive. The non-Euclidean wing configuration and "gripping reality" concept transform familiar flight narrative. Risk-taking in the conceptual premise pays off, though execution occasionally leans on familiar workshop-tinkerer tropes.</comment>
