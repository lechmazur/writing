I'll evaluate this story systematically under the demanding standards for literary publication.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered sensory details, symbolic gestures, and a pattern of communion that culminates in a resonant reconfiguration when Lyra responds through the ghostly flower and melody.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is crystal clear - articulating Lyra's unspoken loneliness through their shared graffiti language. His internal state ("driftingly alert calm") manifests in deliberate, dance-like movements. The emotional progression from focused work to "weary smile" feels earned, though the piece could push deeper into contradictory impulses during the moment of potential failure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Lyra's spectral flower response transforms the opening's isolation into connection with visible cost (her bodiless existence, his temporary communion). The accumulative structure coheres perfectly as sensory details build toward the tinkling melody payoff. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the "ghost in code" concept.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sky-courtyard setting actively constrains the timeframe (lightning to thunder) and provides the interface (stone plinth) for communion. Sensory details are exquisite - "tasting of ozone and wild, high-altitude blossoms" - and the misty environment becomes Lyra's medium of response. The bolt plate functions as micro-setting that enables the entire exchange.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (connection with Lyra's consciousness) faces genuine pressure through the time constraint and uncertainty of response. The "heart-stopping second" of potential failure provides the necessary tightening, though the resolution comes somewhat easily once achieved. Cost is visible in the temporary nature of communion and Lyra's entropic decay.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the act of translating raw emotional signals into comprehensible art - a meditation on communication across existential boundaries. The Silver-Whorl bloom carries layered meaning as both memory anchor and proof of recognition. The ending resists easy comfort, acknowledging the "fleeting grace note" nature of their connection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevation - "pencil-thin beam of silver light," "entropic decay of her consciousness." POV remains tightly controlled with appropriate narrative certainty. Slight register elevation in places ("atmospheric architecture") but largely justified by the otherworldly setting and Elian's artistic sensibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose maintains strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor issues with occasional elevated diction ("monumentally complex") and one instance of telling that could be trimmed ("His purpose was simple...").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The ghost-in-machine concept gets fresh treatment through botanical memory anchors and weather system integration. The graffiti-as-language innovation feels organic to these characters. While the core premise of digital consciousness isn't novel, the specific execution through pressed flowers and atmospheric architecture brings genuine originality.</comment>
