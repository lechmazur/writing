<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal conflict between commercial success and artistic integrity drives genuine choices, particularly the burial of the seashell fragment as both apology and promise. The ephemeral cameos effectively embody his abandoned creative impulses acting simultaneously rather than as mere memories. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "despair as personal current" metaphor early on.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—Elias's act of burying the seashell transforms his relationship to his abandoned stories from guilt to guardianship, with visible emotional cost. The pattern of ghostly appearances builds density toward the central clearing where all cameos converge. The return to his desk with "fertile ground" reweights the opening's creative sterility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The feral nexus effectively constrains choice through its misty disorientation and the physical current pushing against Elias. Sensory details like "damp earth" and "phantom smell of rain on hot asphalt" are selective and purposeful. The seashell fragment functions as micro-setting that charges the final burial image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each ghostly encounter intensifies Elias's recognition of creative betrayal, culminating in the "gale threatening to sweep him into nothingness." The burial choice forecloses his role as author in favor of keeper, with clear cost in accepting his failures. The physical current's transformation from opposition to "gentle nudge" marks earned resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of abandoned stories as living ghosts requiring honor rather than resurrection. The seashell fragment's transformation from childhood hope to burial seed offers non-literal answer to the question of creative integrity versus commercial success. The final image of blank page as "fertile ground" resonantly reweights the opening's creative emptiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "the world had frayed into mist" and "breathing the very air inside the whisper of closing pages." Voice maintains lyric consistency through the surreal encounter while grounding abstract concepts in physical sensation. Minor filter verb clusters ("he felt," "he realized") in middle sections prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with evocative phrases like "starlight caught in her hair" and effective rhythm variation. Some overwriting in metaphor density ("the ceaseless drive of despair he had come to know as his own personal current") and occasional abstract phrasing ("hollow and cynical thing"). The closing image achieves strong propulsion without loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of abandoned story ideas manifesting as ghostly cameos offers fresh angle on writer's guilt. Specific invented characters (boy with mechanical heart, librarian cataloguing scents) avoid generic types. The transformation from author to keeper provides non-obvious resolution, though the meta-fictional frame of writer contemplating writing is somewhat familiar territory.</comment>
