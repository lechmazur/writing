<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's progression from survival-focused leader to community builder shows clear internal contradiction between immediate need and long-term hope, with the bell discovery forcing a choice between secrecy and shared memory. The final decision to publicly declare the garden project demonstrates earned change with visible cost (exposure risk). Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("oppressive nights," "achingly familiar") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building from anonymous donations through bell discovery to public declaration and garden creation, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the community transforms from passive recipients to active builders. The bell functions as the critical turning point that reweights all prior gifts from charity to solidarity. Cost is visible in the risk of exposure and the physical labor of breaking hard ground after decades of decline.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor transforms from "skeletal structure" and "place of ghosts" to active garden site, effectively constraining Elara's choice of response location and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("withered root vegetables," "hard earth"), though some descriptions lean generic ("monochrome of want"). The arbor's evolution from folly to harvest ground embodies the story's transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from basic survival through mysterious benefaction to community renewal, with the bell discovery forcing Elara to choose between safety (staying hidden) and growth (public declaration). The final offering of seeds rather than food confirms the donor's approval while raising new stakes of sustainability. Pressure coheres well under the Accumulative lens with meaningful deepening that changes knowledge and options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the progression from anonymous charity to remembered identity to intergenerational knowledge transfer, avoiding explicit moralizing. The bell's shift from private memory-trigger to public rallying symbol effectively reweights prior material. The final image of "planting its future" resonates without stating a thesis, though "authentic sounds of a community" edges toward thematic labeling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent formal register with controlled rhythm that modulates effectively during Elara's declaration ("We receive this gift"). Some filter-heavy passages ("felt the drain," "felt like a trap") and occasional register elevation ("amplified quiet," "achingly familiar") that doesn't fully match the survival context. Dialogue is minimal but functional when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though several instances of abstract phrasing ("monochrome of want," "dog-eat-dog reality," "fragile bridge") and some filter verb clustering in emotional beats. The declaration sequence shows strong syntactic variety and rhythm. Minor redundancy in describing the community's suffering early on, and "authentic sounds" in the final line reads as unnecessary labeling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of anonymous donations from an exiled community member who signals identity through a culturally-specific object offers a fresh angle on post-conflict survival narratives. The transformation of charity into collaborative building avoids simple resolution. The arbor's evolution from optimistic folly to functional garden provides non-obvious symbolic weight, though the sanctions/exile setup itself is somewhat familiar territory.</comment>
