<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to "sandpaper rough memories" drives genuine internal conflict through embodied sensation (the fossilized bivalve's weight, tasting legions of sorrow). The final transformation from brittle to "sturdy" lands with earned cost after subsumption, though the Warlord remains somewhat functional rather than fully realized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught sediment reading paying off in the pavilion discovery. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Kaelen's transformation from conduit of forced grief to voluntary processor, with visible cost ("scoured clean... terrifyingly smooth"). The final touch without transferred pain confirms the change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Desert fortress after rain creates immediate sensory grounding ("wet stone and bruised creosote") with the puddle formations constraining Kaelen's ritual work. The icebound pavilion's impossible physics ("unmelting ice") and dissolution into sand effectively charges the final transformation, though mid-story transitions could be more spatially precise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from analyzing puddles to discovering the pavilion to voluntary subsumption of millennia of grief. The pressure coheres through accumulation: personal grief → Warlord's specific loss → collective sorrow requiring total surrender. Cost is unmistakable in the scouring agony that transforms Kaelen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of processing grief as sustenance ("a chef... whose craft extended beyond mere sustenance"). The ending offers resonant non-literal answer: peace comes not from smoothing memories but from complete acceptance and release, reweighting the opening's "unspoken dream."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through culinary metaphors ("tasted the Warlord's frantic digging") and sensory-focused narration maintains consistency. Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("universe of stored remorse") slightly strains the chef-POV's natural lexicon but doesn't break voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, though occasional overwriting appears ("motes of pale luminescence, each one a captured moment of regret"). Some abstract phrasing ("universe of stored remorse," "collective sorrow was a physical pressure") could be more concrete. Information density remains solid throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chef-as-emotional-processor with the specific detail of reading sediment patterns in ephemeral puddles. The coral pavilion beneath desert sands offers genuine surprise while feeling earned through the memory-map logic. Transformation of familiar grief-processing into literal taste/subsumption avoids template resolution.</comment>
