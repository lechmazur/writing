<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to translate silence into music drives concrete choices throughout, with her trauma from the capsize creating genuine internal conflict between fear and persistence. The transformation of her terror into art shows earned change with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("profound peace") in resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through color-emotion synesthesia that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where trauma transforms into beauty. The cost is legible in "deep exhaustion settling into her bones" and the emotional price of confronting the capsize memory. Orientation anchors (conservatory, post-silence world) establish cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory functions as both physical constraint and emotional canvas, with frosted panes becoming the score for Elara's visual symphony. Sensory detail effectively balances thermal perception with tactile elements. The setting directly enables the climactic transformation when glass surfaces display the emotional light-show.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from attempting to perceive the flower's bloom to confronting unbidden trauma memories, with the protagonist actively choosing to weave terror and beauty together rather than retreat. The cost manifests in physical exhaustion and emotional toll. One meaningful deepening occurs when past trauma intrudes and must be integrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of silence into visual music and trauma into art, avoiding direct statement. The final image of the opened cereus resonates as beauty blooming "not in spite of the silence, but because of it." The recurring color-emotion patterns accumulate meaning without forced symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through thermal/color synesthesia maintains consistency, with prose rhythm modulating during the trauma intrusion ("jagged, searing orange"). Some filter verbs ("she focused," "she reached out") slightly dull immediacy but serve the meditative pace. Voice remains controlled through emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective variation in sentence structure and purposeful imagery. Deductions for redundancy ("quiet it had accepted"/"profound quiet"), some abstract phrasing ("phantom roar that now had no voice"), and occasional overwriting in metaphor density. The climactic sequence maintains clarity despite complex color-emotion mapping.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of trauma recovery through synesthetic art creation offers a fresh angle on both survivor narrative and post-apocalyptic setting. The specific method of heat-mapping emotions to create visual music feels inventive. The world where sound has ceased provides an original constraint that shapes all choices.</comment>
