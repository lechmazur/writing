<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyra's transformation from "fearful jailer" to accepting guide is earned through the visceral return of her clairvoyance in overlapping shadows, with clear cost in her lost gift. The internal contradiction between protective duty and the cave's true desire acts simultaneously in scene. Minor deduction for Kael's relatively thin characterization beyond his pure motivation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as Lyra accepts her "obsolescence" and loses her clairvoyance, with cost visible in "for the first time, she felt no need to know what would happen next." The accumulative/textural lens holds through shadow communications and crystalline disruptions building to transformation. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The musical crystal cave constrains choices through its consciousness—stuttering melodies signal disruption, oscillating crystals guide Kael's path, and the Heartstone's placement on the spire triggers world transformation. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lyra's foresight-dependent perspective shifting to simple sight. The cave functions as active agent, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from protecting the Heartstone through the cave's increasing unpredictability to Lyra's realization of her misunderstood purpose, with cost in her lost clairvoyance. The cave's agency drives pressure through shadow communications and guided paths. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though Kael's minimal resistance slightly weakens tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between fearful hoarding and humble sharing, crystallized in Lyra's shift from guardian to guide. The overlapping shadows that merge perspectives create resonant unity. Final image of contentment with uncertainty reweights the entire guardian role without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Lyra's foresight-filtered awareness ("felt his approach not as a premonition, but as a discordant note"). Controlled psychic distance shifts during the shadow-merge revelation. Some register elevation in phrases like "immense, ancient desire" slightly above the mystical-practical voice elsewhere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though "immense, ancient desire" and "humble instrument" edge toward elevated register in peak beats (-0.4). Information density strong in shadow communication sequences. Minor template cadence in "She saw... She saw... And she saw" structure (-0.3).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shadow-merging mechanism for revealing truth offers fresh specificity, and Lyra's obsolescence as guardian inverts expected protector tropes. The musical cave consciousness communicating through shadow tableaux provides original world-building. Somewhat familiar pilgrim-seeks-artifact frame limits higher scoring.</comment>
