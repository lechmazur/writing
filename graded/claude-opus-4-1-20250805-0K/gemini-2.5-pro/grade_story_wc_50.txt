<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's peripherally focused trait drives his method and eventual success, with clear motivation rooted in storing wonder. The internal consistency holds throughout, though the emotional arc remains somewhat cerebral rather than viscerally embodied. His patient endurance through the "wounded season" shows genuine struggle against the void left by the machine's death.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through reflection observations until the resonant reconfiguration when echoes bloom again. The closure lands with felt cost—a generation's lost wedding memory returning to push back against grey stillness. The piece teaches its pattern of oblique observation early and pays it off when Elian's indirect method succeeds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The marble cavern functions as both setting and instrument, its geometry essential to the timer's operation. Sensory details like "faint, secondary reflections" and the "celestial clock hand" of sunlight are purposeful and constraint-driven. The environment directly shapes Elian's method and enables the final harvest of echoes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation—from studying reflections to understanding the timer's logic to reconstruction. The dominant stake (preserving wonder) faces genuine pressure from the "wounded season's oppressive calm" and the broken mechanism. Cost is visible in weeks of patient observation and the weight of dormant memories waiting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete work of preserving memory's physics, avoiding abstraction. The final image of golden light painting the wall with candlelight's ghost offers a non-literal answer about wonder's preservation. Subtext operates through the relationship between direct and peripheral observation, though some passages edge toward explicit ("store wonder in the cellar of reason").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elian's peripheral focus and methodical documentation. Voice maintains consistency through technical precision balanced with lyrical moments ("echoes waiting in the marble, dormant and patient"). The prose rhythm modulates appropriately from patient observation to the resonant final bloom of sound and light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the harvest of echoes" and "celestial clock hand," though some passages tend toward overwriting ("lull of a wounded season," "monochrome silence"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple purposes. Minor register elevation in places ("singular focus," "arduous task") slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The peripheral observation method offers a fresh angle on problem-solving, though the core premise of memory-harvesting mechanisms feels somewhat familiar. Specific details like studying reflection angles at different times and the cavern's geometry as resonator show originality. The synthesis of light, sound, and memory storage demonstrates solid conceptual work.</comment>
