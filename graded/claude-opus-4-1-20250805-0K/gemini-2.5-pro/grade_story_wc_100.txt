I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This story operates under a **Causal** lens - each beat follows because/therefore logic from the package arrival through to the resolution of Elias's torment.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through the "psychic static that frayed the edges of his world," with his weariness etched physically. The contradiction between his death-work and his desperate need for silence creates genuine internal tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "inadvertently stubborn" trait that lacks specific embodiment in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from package to library to resolution, with the lens serving as the crucial linking device. The closure lands as a Decisive Change - Elias transforms from tormented receiver to active resolver of spiritual distress, with clear cost (his life's exhaustion). The "occupying impossible spaces" ability feels slightly convenient but is adequately costly ("immense cost").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater library setting constrains and enables the resolution beautifully - "shelves carved from basalt" and the "astrolabe of coral and pearl" create specific, purposeful detail. The sensory hierarchy effectively narrows from storm-tossed pier to crushing pressure to cathedral-like silence. Slight deduction for the abstract "non-space" passage that lacks concrete anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (ending the psychic noise) escalates cleanly from personal torment to active solution, with the lens discovery tightening options to one dangerous path. The cost is legible in "crushing depth," the talent's "immense cost," and the physical pressure manifestation. The resolution directly addresses the established conflict with earned agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of an undertaker seeking not death but true rest - "giving rest a permanent address." The broken lens becoming the key to wholeness resonates without stating a moral. The final image of "threads of panic and sorrow woven into a tapestry of tranquil history" offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how suffering finds peace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled diction ("salt-stained," "discordant energy") and effective psychic distance modulation from external observation to deep interiority. The prose rhythm effectively slows during the underwater sequence. Minor weakness in the slightly elevated register during action ("folded the world around himself") that briefly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong verb choices and varied sentence structure. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some figurative density in the transformation sequence ("pulling the roaring ocean over his head like a blanket") borders on overwriting but serves the surreal moment. Minor template cadence in the final paragraph's parallel constructions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of a broken lighthouse lens becoming the missing piece of an underwater soul-repository offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of undertaker-as-spiritual-engineer transforms familiar death-work tropes. The "occupying impossible spaces" ability and the astrolabe mechanism feel slightly convenient but are grounded in cost and specificity.</comment>
