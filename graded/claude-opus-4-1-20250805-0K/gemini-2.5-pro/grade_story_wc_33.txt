I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identified: Causal** - The story operates through clear because/therefore linkages: mapping drone gaps enables the static burst, which creates the transfer window, which reunites the consciousness with family.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is crystalline and embodied through concrete action, with his "quiet ache" manifesting in calculated rebellion. The contradiction between duty (mailman) and defiance (smuggler) creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "where broken promises heal" which leans conceptual, though it pays off through dramatized action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from mapping voids to exploiting them, with clear Decisive Change when the daughter's consciousness successfully transfers. The cost is visible in risk and separation. Orientation anchors effectively by paragraph two. The closure lands with "building it, one absence at a time" showing transformation from seeker to creator.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade and "brittle hush" atmosphere effectively constrain the action to this specific moment. Sensory details like "dust...a second skin" and the thunderstorm's "impossible silver lightning" are vivid. The setting actively shapes tactics through the drone border's sensor patterns, though some descriptions trend toward the atmospheric rather than fully tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal mission to execution under surveillance threat. The thirty-second window creates genuine pressure with "an eternity in the brittle hush." The cost manifests in the risk taken and the "enforced separation" being challenged. One meaningful tightening through the time constraint effectively narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "linking absences" to create presence. The final insight about building rather than finding the place "where broken promises heal" offers resonant closure without moralizing. Subtext operates well through the "respectfully rebellious" paradox and the silence/connection duality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent control with distinctive diction like "trafficked in something far more ephemeral" and "artform of negatives." The perceptual signature shows in how Elias notices gaps rather than presences. Some moments edge toward elevated register ("sacrament," "ephemeral") but remain within bounds for this character's interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in "Three. Two. One. He uncorked the bottle." Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("ephemeral," "compromise") and slight overwriting in metaphors like "twilight bled across the sky, staining the clouds the color of a fading bruise."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of smuggling consciousness through sensor gaps offers genuine freshness. The "artform of negatives" and using absence to create connection inverts expectations meaningfully. The specific synthesis of mail carrier as data smuggler with the thunderstorm-in-a-bottle as EMP device shows inventive world-building that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
