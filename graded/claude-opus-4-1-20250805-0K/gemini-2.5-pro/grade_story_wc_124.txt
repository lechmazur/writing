<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's grief-driven caution and sensory hypersensitivity create clear, embodied motivation throughout. His contradictory impulses—seeking yet fearing the scent's trigger—play out in scene through trembling hands and measured breaths. The final acceptance of grief as "cleansing sorrow" rather than "sharp terror" shows earned transformation with visible cost in his tears.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural design builds through sensory details toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts grief rather than resisting it. The UV revelation of "Somniflora" creates causal linkage between Elara's secret perfume and the extinct flower, paying off the setup cleanly. Cost is unmistakable in the final tears as "tribute" and "acceptance," with the transformation metaphor linking flower and emotional state.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse of extinct plants functions as more than setting—it mirrors Elias's preserved grief and enables the UV experiment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "humid air," "crystalline splinters," "twilight petals." The UV apparatus and sterile workstation constrain his experimental approach, though some descriptions edge toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from cautious entry to UV experiment to flower blooming to scent recognition. The dominant stake—understanding why scents trigger tears—tightens as each revelation narrows his emotional options. The cost manifests physically in tears and emotionally in accepting "the beautiful impact of memories" rather than defending against them.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the parallel between extinct flower and lost love, both preserved yet triggering transformation. The "Somniflora" (sleeping flower) metaphor resonates without explicit moralizing. The final image of breathing in what he'd long resisted offers a non-literal answer about accepting rather than defending against memory's ambushes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elegance with character-specific perception: "aromatically cautious," "library of lost fragrances." The perceptual signature—a light-broker drawn to shadows—shapes what's noticed. Some register elevation ("ineffably soft") occasionally strains the emotional authenticity, and filter verbs accumulate in places ("He believed," "He understood").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision: "Glass panes, slick with condensation, fractured the afternoon sun into a thousand sharp, crystalline splinters." However, some figurative density slows momentum ("ghost that haunted his senses," "hollowing grief"). Minor loops appear in the grief descriptions, and some sentences could tighten without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The extinct flower housing a lost love's secret perfume offers a fresh synthesis of memory and botanical preservation. The UV revealing method adds specificity beyond typical grief narratives. While the core emotional arc is familiar, the particular combination of elements—light broker seeking shadows, extinct fragrances, chemical secrets—creates originality through specificity.</comment>
