<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is deeply rooted in his retrocognitive curse/blessing, with internal contradiction between despair at the silence and hope in cosmic patterns driving him toward the risky reassembly. The moment of wavering before placing the shard of hush ("perhaps the silence was the true state of things") shows genuine internal conflict acting in scene. His "thistle-blown hope" metaphor embodies character-specific perception throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the alignment night, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the beacon's rekindling proves coincidences have meaning. Cost is visible in the generations of silence broken and Elian's acceptance that the light is "fragile" rather than blazing. The orientation anchors (Elian, Spire, post-collapse world) establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass pavilion functions as both observatory and workspace, constraining Elian's method to stellar alignments through its dome. Sensory details like "striping the floor with silver" and the pavilion's resonant hum returning create lived-in specificity. The "fractured plains stretched into a bruised twilight" establishes the post-apocalyptic scope effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal obsession to cosmic validation as the century-only alignment approaches, with Elian's wavering resolve ("For a terrifying second, his resolve wavered") creating genuine tension before the final commitment. The cost of generations of silence and isolation lands tangibly when the beacon produces only "a fragile heartbeat against the infinite dark" rather than the old world's blazing pillar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of finding meaning in apparent randomness emerges through the concrete image of crystal shards following star-lanes, not through abstract statement. The final image of the "fragile heartbeat against the infinite dark" offers a non-literal answer that connection can be rebuilt but will never match what was lost. The thistle seed metaphor recurs meaningfully to embody tenacious hope.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elian's perceptual signature shows through his technical focus ("faceted the stone," "cross-referencing faded celestial charts") and poetic framing ("bruised twilight," "thistle-blown hope"). Some filter verb clusters appear ("he saw," "he looked") but voice remains consistent through emotional pressure. The prose modulates effectively between technical precision and lyrical reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "thistle seed taking root in rubble," though some redundancy appears in the retrocognitive vision descriptions. The opening efficiently establishes world and stakes. Minor scaffold in "For years, he worked" transition and some filter verb accumulation ("he held it," "he saw," "he looked") dulls immediacy in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of proving cosmic meaning through disaster-created star maps offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic reconstruction. The specific synthesis of retrocognition, stellar navigation, and crystal optics creates non-obvious convergence. The "shard of hush" as the keystone that deepens silence before enabling connection shows conceptual sophistication.</comment>
