<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to preserve wonder is embodied through physical craft and seasonal muteness that enforces focus. His internal state reads through action—"muted vigor," "quiet burning"—rather than exposition. The final moment of "calm satisfaction" and searching for the next truth shows earned continuity rather than resolution, though some phrasing edges toward the abstract ("guardian," "collective consciousness").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure: the sculpture's deliberate self-destruction releases truth at the cost of its form. The piece teaches its pattern early (silence aids focus, ice holds memory) and pays it off when "the music literally costing the ice its form." Cost is visible and conceptual—beauty vanishes to renew wonder.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bluff setting constrains the work through specific wind patterns ("unique to that single hour of that single day") that enable the sculpture's activation. Sensory detail layers effectively—"keening wind," "pearlescent sky," "crystalline clarity." The workshop-as-open-bluff and the ice's physical properties directly shape Elian's choices and methods.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes accumulate through the sculpture's construction toward the singular moment of wind activation. The dominant stake—preserving wonder in a grey world—faces its test when the sculpture must destroy itself to release its truth. Cost is legible: "the music literally costing the ice its form" shows beauty traded for meaning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central paradox of preservation through destruction, never stated directly. The image of "a thousand brilliant points of fire" dissolving into mist embodies the cost of truth-telling. The final search for "the next fading truth" resists closure while honoring the cyclic nature of the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevation appropriate to the world where "truth was a resonance felt in the bones." Perceptual signature shows in how Elian experiences the ice's "song thrumming faintly against his palms." Some phrases edge toward purple ("permanent clouds," "frozen tears") but rhythm control through the climax is strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty—"The entire sculpture began to glisten with a vibrant, inner light"—but carries some overwriting. Phrases like "profound silence of his seasonal muteness" and "uniform grey of knowing" add unnecessary abstraction. Information density is generally high, with most sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of seasonal muteness enabling symphonic truth-construction feels fresh and earned. The specific synthesis of ice-carving, sound-shaping, and deliberate destruction creates an original artistic system. Risk-taking in the world-building (post-verbal society, truth as resonance) heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
