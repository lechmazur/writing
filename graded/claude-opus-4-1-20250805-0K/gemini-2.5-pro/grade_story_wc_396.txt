I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This story operates under a **Causal lens** - each revelation follows because/therefore linkage as Kael's visions reveal truth, which changes Mara's understanding and resolves the conflict.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion in Mara's "shoulders slumped, the rigid anger draining away" and Kael's intuitive methodology. Internal contradiction operates well through Mara's fear masquerading as anger. Minor deduction for slight therapy-speak in "map empathy onto action" though it's quickly grounded in scene work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as community fracture transforms to "first step toward mending." Cost is visible in Mara's revealed trauma and Jorn's isolation. Causal chain from accusation through vision to revelation is clean. The "weighted breath" motif creates effective structural bookending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse-orchard setting uniquely constrains choices - the "impossible sanctuary" and "grinding ice floes" create existential pressure. The cheval mirror enables the central action. Slight deduction for not fully exploiting the ice-floe danger in immediate scene pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation follows causal progression from accusation to investigation to revelation, with stakes tightening as visions reveal deeper truths. The dominant stake of community cohesion faces real threat with visible cost in Mara's past loss. Agency operates through Kael's choice to seek deeper truth rather than declare verdict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of perception versus reality emerges organically through the vision sequence without moralizing. The final image of "mending more than just a rope" resonates beyond literal plot. Subtext operates well in the unspoken connection between Mara's past trauma and present accusation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled psychic distance and clean focalization through Kael. Some register elevation in "keening wind" and "weighted breath" fits the mythic tone. Minor deduction for slight voice flattening during vision sequences where specificity could be sharper.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though "weighted breath" appears three times creating mild repetition. Information density is solid with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction ("tableau," "resonance") occasionally drifts from established register but doesn't harm clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of detective story with mystical elements in an Arctic survival setting. The broken crystal ball fragment as investigative tool and the lighthouse-orchard combination show genuine originality. The twist that Jorn was helping rather than sabotaging effectively subverts expectations.</comment>
