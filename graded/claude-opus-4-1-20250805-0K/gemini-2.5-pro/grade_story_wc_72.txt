<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's transformation from righteous crusader to moral questioner is earned through concrete revelation and embodied conflict. The internal contradiction between her mission certainty and emerging truth creates genuine tension, particularly in "Her mission, once a righteous crusade, now felt like a planned desecration." The final choice to bury the poison rather than deploy it demonstrates clear agency with visible cost—forgoing her mission identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Decisive Change through Mara's choice to bury the poison, with clear cost in abandoning her mission and identity. Causal lens holds: each revelation (they weren't conquerors → the membrane is a lung → she's the disease) drives the next beat toward her final action. The closure lands with felt cost as she "buried the certainty she once carried," though the immediate stakes could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater city garden vividly constrains and enables choice through "bioluminescent flora pulsed with soft, internal light" and the crucial gill-membrane that reframes as the city's lung. Setting directly shapes the climactic decision—the soft sediment allows burial of the ampoule. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though some descriptions like "paths of crushed pearl and obsidian" lean decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through cascading revelations that progressively narrow Mara's options: sanctuary not tomb → poison not purifier → lung not weakness. The dominant stake (completing vs. abandoning the mission) tightens as each revelation increases the moral cost. However, the absence of immediate external pressure or time constraint slightly dampens urgency at the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the foxglove metaphor—beautiful flower as deadly poison mirrors the mission's righteous appearance hiding piracy. The final image of burying "the certainty she once carried" resonantly answers the central question about truth versus belief without stating a moral. Subtext operates effectively through Galen's "incisively kind" telepathy offering "no comfort for the lies."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close-third with strong perceptual signature: "The secret settled not like dust, but like silt" establishes distinctive metaphorical thinking. Galen's telepathic intrusions are cleanly differentiated in italics. Some elevated diction ("cascading revelations," "profound, aching clarity") occasionally drifts from crisis immediacy but remains within Mara's educated register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in "This was supposed to be a tomb to hubris, not a cradle of life." Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor redundancies appear ("quiet, welcome complexity" after establishing the buried certainty) and some abstract phrasing ("profound, aching clarity") could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The reversal of infiltrator-becomes-protector freshly inverts the expected sabotage narrative. The foxglove ampoule as both beautiful and deadly offers non-obvious thematic resonance. The telepathic statue as moral guide rather than antagonist subverts expectations, though the wise-mentor-reveals-truth pattern is somewhat familiar.</comment>
