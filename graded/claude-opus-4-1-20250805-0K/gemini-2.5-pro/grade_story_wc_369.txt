I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through the cataloging of sorrow, building toward a resonant reconfiguration when the shard transforms from jagged grief to serene acceptance.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and embodied through specific actions—his "quantified sorrow" work and deeper need to understand what trees witness. The final choice to archive rather than fix sadness shows earned wisdom. Minor deduction for slight emotional abstraction in the middle sections.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where crystallized sorrow transforms through moonlight into "serene acceptance," with visible cost in the tree's death memory. The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward this transformation. Slight dock for the orientation taking until ~140 words to fully anchor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The broken sextant as tool constrains how Aris analyzes sorrow, requiring specific moonlight angles through cracked glass. The storm and tower setting pressure the timing and atmosphere of his work, charging the final mosaic image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from routine work to the mysterious *tink*, to analyzing the tree's centuries of life, to the spike in sorrow-meter readings. The storm's crescendo aligning with moonlight creates meaningful deepening that enables transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the premise that grief needs archiving, not fixing—"to give it a home." The tree's silent witnessing and the transformation of sorrow into acceptance offer a non-literal answer about memory and loss without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled diction ("quantified sorrow," "phantasmagoria") that fits Aris's scholarly perspective. Strong perceptual signature in how he notices dust motes as colleagues and interprets emotional resonance through scientific instruments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good information density and varied rhythm. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("basso complaint," "cool, stone throat") and slight register elevation that doesn't always match the POV's established voice in peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-as-substance with astronomical tools for emotional analysis creates an original world logic. The concept of trees as emotional archivists whose sorrow crystallizes offers a non-obvious angle on loss and memory.</comment>
