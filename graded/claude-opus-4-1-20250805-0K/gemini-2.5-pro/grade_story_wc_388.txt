<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's methodical expertise and scientific skepticism drive consistent choices through the investigation, with the final act of lowering the diamond showing measured restraint over exploitation. The character's professional detachment creates subtle tension against the locals' beliefs, though internal contradiction could deepen.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal linkage from superstition to investigation to discovery, with the stillpoint revelation reframing the orchard's survival as physics rather than folklore. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing where "one more lie had been carefully excavated and replaced with a fact" carries intellectual cost—the loss of comforting mythology—though emotional weight remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The irradiated wasteland contrasts sharply with the verdant orchard, creating a visceral boundary that shapes the entire investigation. The derelict station's shredded papers become setting-as-puzzle, constraining Kaelen's method for three days, though some descriptions lean toward catalog rather than lived experience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds from surface observation to document reconstruction to the final alignment test, each step narrowing the truth. The dominant stake—exposing truth versus preserving protective myth—tightens when Kaelen must intuit the final step, though the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of comfortable lies versus uncomfortable truths emerges organically through Thorne's deliberate mythology and Kaelen's excavation. The final image of leaves "rustling in a wind that carried no dust" resonates as both literal physics and metaphorical preservation of illusion's protective power.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clinical, precise narration reflects Kaelen's scientific mindset through phrases like "a problem to be solved" and attention to "asymmetrical lattice." The voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive rhythm or compression under the pressure of discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clean, efficient prose with strong information density, particularly in the document reconstruction sequence. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("zone of life met the zone of death") that slightly tensions with Kaelen's pragmatic voice, and "perpetual grey sky" borders on stock imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The stillpoint concept offers a fresh scientific explanation for post-apocalyptic survival, avoiding typical radiation immunity tropes. Thorne's deliberate myth-making to protect discovery from weaponization adds moral complexity, though the investigator-debunker frame itself follows familiar patterns.</comment>
