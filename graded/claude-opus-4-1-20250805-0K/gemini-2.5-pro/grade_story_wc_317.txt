<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's receptivity to mystery and methodical puzzle-solving mindset create genuine internal texture, particularly in his shift from business fatigue to engaged curiosity. The progression from exhaustion to ritual commitment lands with earned weight. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("resonant curiosity," "different kind of energy") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer toward Elias's commitment to nurture the seed—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (years of dedication). The deductive process through physical evidence, botanical research, and symbolic reasoning creates satisfying linkage. Deduction for the cost being more declared than felt in the final moments; we understand but don't viscerally experience the weight of this decade-long commitment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven with brook creates immediate atmosphere, and the corpse flower's grotesque properties constrain Elias's choice meaningfully. The terracotta pot placement among blueprints charges the final image. Some sensory opportunities missed—the seed's texture, the soil's smell—that would deepen immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mystery deepens through orthogonal investigation approaches, creating intellectual tension. The revelation about Finch and the "patience is the lock and the key" callback provides meaningful tightening. However, the stakes remain primarily cerebral without visceral pressure; Elias faces no real opposition or cost beyond time commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The corpse flower as metaphor for patient, challenging creation resonates strongly with Elias's escape room artistry. The theme of cultivating enigmas rather than solving them emerges organically. The Finch connection and "living contract" concept deepen thematic texture, though the final insight edges toward explicit articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines precise botanical terminology with puzzle-maker's analytical mindset. Perceptual signature strong in how Elias processes the mystery through "orthogonal approaches." Clean free indirect style throughout, though some abstract phrases ("resonant curiosity," "possibility just born") slightly blur the otherwise sharp focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density high in the botanical research section. Deductions for abstract phrasing clusters ("resonant curiosity," "different kind of energy," "profound and shared understanding") and slight overwriting in metaphorical language ("storm-born silence," "nocturnal haven").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The corpse flower seed as decade-long puzzle gift shows genuine originality, transforming typical mystery-box tropes through temporal expansion. The connection between escape rooms and cultivating living enigmas offers fresh perspective. Slightly formulaic in the deductive sequence structure.</comment>
