I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This story operates under a **Causal lens** - each beat follows because/therefore linkage as Kael's understanding leads to his invention, which enables the resolution.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is deeply rooted in grief and his unique spatial perception, with concrete embodiment through his anxious thumb-rubbing of the device. The internal conflict between holding on and letting go manifests through specific action rather than abstract rumination. Loses points for the slightly convenient alignment of his professional skills with his personal need.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Decisive Change closure where Kael releases the ghost of his lost love, with visible emotional cost ("profound exhaustion... extinguishing the quiet wildfire"). The causal chain from perception to invention to release is clear. The orientation anchors (cavern, mushroom farm, security specialist) establish cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bioluminescent cavern setting directly enables the dimensional barrier mechanism central to the plot. Sensory details (ozone taste, blue-green glow) are selective and purposeful. The mycelial network's field generation constrains the entire conflict, though some technical details remain vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (releasing grief through understanding its physics) escalates from observation to invention to action. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through his device. Cost is visible in the "profound exhaustion" and the permanence of the ghosts' departure, though the middle lacks significant complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the physics metaphor for grief - "not to make a stronger wall, but to build a better door." The ending reweights the entire premise without stating a moral, showing that understanding grief's mechanism enables release rather than control.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with Kael's unique perceptual signature (seeing forces rather than objects). Some register elevation in phrases like "sacred moment" and "profound exhaustion" slightly jar against the technical voice. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("ghostly blue-green light," "sacred moment"). Minor redundancy in explaining the familiar strangers concept. The final paragraph's "profound exhaustion... extinguishing the quiet wildfire" borders on overwrought but maintains clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-as-physics with the security specialist who builds doors instead of walls. The dimensional barrier mechanism and mushroom farm setting create an original framework for exploring loss. The specific detail of the modified laser pointer button adds memorable tactile grounding.</comment>
