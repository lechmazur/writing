<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's involuntary truthfulness creates genuine internal tension against his desire to preserve wonder through indirect revelation. The shift from weary inspector to "person tasked with reminding a city how to feel again" shows earned character change with visible cost. Minor deduction for slightly abstract articulation of his motivation in the middle section.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through Conceptual Repricing—the revelation that routine killed bio-mechanical life reweights the entire premise with clear conceptual cost. The riddle mechanism forces discovery rather than receipt, creating earned revelation. Slight weakness in the speed of Lena's understanding, but the final image of "planted like a seed" resonates with proper weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lightning tower and "thick and sweet" ozone air establish immediate sensory grounding, with "nectar dusk" painting anxious faces creating atmospheric pressure. The lacquer box and matchbox serve as tactile anchors that constrain the reveal method. Missing deeper environmental constraint on choices prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from information request to existential understanding about the city's lost soul, with the riddle mechanism forcing active engagement. The cost—a city must relearn to feel—is conceptually clear. Pressure builds through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the bio-mechanical drones that needed "genuine, chaotic wonder" to survive—sterile efficiency literally killed the city's heart. The riddle itself embodies the theme, forcing poetic engagement over data transfer. "What cold routine has sealed my tomb?" crystallizes the central question with haunting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled elevation ("syrupy, nectar dusk," "humming silence") that matches the story's poetic aims. Silas's truthful but indirect dialogue creates effective subtext. Minor inconsistency in register when explaining his motivation mid-story slightly dulls impact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative imagery ("last rays of sun bleed across the sky") and good rhythmic variation. Some redundancy in explaining Silas's motivation ("quiet, stubborn desire" followed by extended explanation) and slight overwriting in places ("silent, cascading consequence") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The bio-mechanical drones requiring emotional sustenance offers fresh perspective on a familiar "technology fails" premise. The riddle-as-truth-delivery mechanism shows genuine ingenuity. Execution stays within recognizable dystopian bounds but transforms them through specific detail about wonder as literal fuel.</comment>
