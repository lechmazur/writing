<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's brittle devotion manifests through embodied exhaustion and the contradiction between his lukewarm abilities and grandiose ambition, creating genuine internal tension. The final choice to persist despite "crushing futility" shows earned endurance with visible cost (his magic "utterly spent"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("cosmic imbalance he felt deep in his bones") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where the 97-day pattern breaks into successful resonance, creating moisture in the dust—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (exhaustion, time spent). The shift from failed attempts to finding the silence between drips creates decisive change through pattern break. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct and broken bell fragments constrain every choice—Kael must position them "with painstaking precision" and the crystalline structure itself becomes the resonating instrument. Setting actively participates in closure when "the hum vibrated from the bell fragments, through Kael's feet, and into the very structure of the sapphire viaduct." Vivid sensory work with "rose and liquid gold" dawn colors and the contrast between former "thundering" sea and current silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation occurs through the accumulative weight of 97 days building to the moment of understanding—"something shifted." The cost is legible in Kael's depleted magic and the time invested. The shift from adjusting drip speed to understanding the silence between drops creates meaningful deepening that changes his approach and succeeds where repetition failed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete image of rebuilding "not the oceans themselves, but the fundamental song to which they had once answered"—a non-literal answer to restoration. The final moisture spreading "no bigger than his hand" reweights the grandiose ambition into humble beginning. Minor deduction for one instance of abstract phrasing ("a world that had lost its soul").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Kael notices dripping rates and musical intervals ("ting...tong") that reflects his specific obsession. Voice modulates effectively from lyrical description to technical precision when describing his method. Some filter verb usage ("He believed," "Kael felt") that could be more immediate, though it serves the contemplative tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition ("plink, plink" echoing the drops). Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in the crystalline viaduct description. Deduction for abstract phrases like "cosmic imbalance" and "fundamental song" that could be more concrete, and mild overwriting in "rose and liquid gold" dawn description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of failed mage and cosmic restoration through the specific method of understanding dripping rates—unexpected and earned. The "brittle devotion" concept transforms the grandiose into the intimate. Risk-taking in making the protagonist deliberately weak pays off by making his small success more resonant (+0.3 within band).</comment>
