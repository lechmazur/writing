<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied characterization through Alistair's methodical precision and Elara's rigid physicality under possession. The entity's monochrome philosophy creates genuine internal conflict. Minor deduction for the entity's somewhat abstract nature limiting full emotional complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with sonic layering building to conceptual repricing—the entity retreats when its philosophy is "refuted by perspective." Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Cost is conceptual but legible in the entity's forced retreat and Elara's return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor room and loop pedal constrain Alistair's exorcism method effectively. The artist's palette functions as micro-setting that embodies the possession's nature. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through rhetorical questioning that systematically unravels the entity's logic. The tightening occurs as Alistair's layered sound creates "glitch in the entity's perfect, monotonous rhythm." Cost appears in Elara's physical release and the entity's philosophical defeat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the conflict between monochrome certainty and infinite complexity. The final image of gray paint as "just a color, one of many" offers resonant repricing without moralizing. "Sometimes the loudest arguments are the ones we have with ourselves" lands without preaching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signatures between Alistair's measured control and the entity's absolutist declarations. Some register elevation in phrases like "dimensional anchor humming at a frequency felt only in the bones" slightly strains the ecclesiastical POV but maintains overall coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations matching scene pressure. Minor figurative density in opening ("carving silence") and occasional elevated diction ("unnerving quiet," "oppressive smear") without full payoff. Strong information density throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exorcism-as-philosophical-debate using sound loops to create logical recursion. The loop pedal as exorcism tool and rhetoric as weapon show genuine innovation. Risk-taking in the conceptual approach heightens stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
