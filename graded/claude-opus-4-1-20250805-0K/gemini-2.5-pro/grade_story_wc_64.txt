<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's obsessive dedication to decoding the tapestry and his methodical, tender approach to memory create a consistent character driven by a need to honor unfinished stories. The final choice to create a place of honor rather than solve or possess shows earned renunciation with visible cost—he accepts his role as guardian rather than reuniter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear accumulative/textural lens with pattern breaks in the tapestry's frayed edges leading to revelation. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias places the sovereign case beneath the decoded map, reuniting intention with path—the cost is the acceptance that the reunion will never occur. The "gardener of memory" insight reweights his entire practice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt silo's "velveteen gloom" and the cemetery's "sleeping stones" create atmospheric pressure that shapes Elias's ritual workspace. The tapestry's physical deterioration—"pulled crimson strand," "trio of broken gold threads"—becomes the constraint through which discovery occurs, making decay itself the medium of revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative detail: from general obsession to specific decoding method to the final silver thread that "snapped into focus." The dominant stake—discovering intentions left behind—tightens when the sovereign case gives "a single, soft pulse of warmth," confirming the connection and forcing Elias to accept he can only preserve, not fulfill, the promise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of incomplete journeys and preserved intentions emerges through the tapestry's "cipher of intentional decay" and the sovereign case as "empty vessel waiting to be filled." The final image of stars held "not with distance, but with tenderness" reweights the entire piece, suggesting memory work as an act of love rather than archaeology.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical precision—"whistled a tune softer than falling dust," "velveteen gloom"—with controlled rhythm that mirrors Elias's methodical nature. The perceptual signature focuses on texture and decay ("frayed threads," "fractured coffin") reflecting his unique attention to deterioration as information.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with evocative phrases like "chess clock runs down on the world of the living," though occasional overwriting appears ("immense wooden frame" could be "large"). Some metaphor density in non-peak moments ("velveteen gloom that smelled of dry earth") but the figurative language mostly serves atmosphere and doesn't obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of reading decay as language—finding messages in "frayed threads" and "intentional damage"—offers a fresh angle on memory and loss. The specific method of cross-referencing textile damage with star charts to decode a celestial route creates an original synthesis of crafts that feels organic to this character's obsessive nature.</comment>
