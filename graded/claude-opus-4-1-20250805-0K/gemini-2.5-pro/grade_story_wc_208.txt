Looking at this story through a Causal drive lens - the discovery of the slide causes Elara to project it, which reveals the covenant, which enables her to save herself from the wave.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation coheres well - her drive to "scaffold complexity with simplicity" manifests concretely as she decodes and applies the ancient pattern. The decisive moment where she shifts from artist to custodian feels earned. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("turbine-hum reverie") and slightly convenient competence with the grandfather's projector under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: found slide → projection reveals covenant → pattern saves her from wave. The closure (Decisive Change from artist to custodian of ancient knowledge) lands with clear cost - she must rebuild a disconnected world. The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Slight deduction for the convenient timing of the wave's arrival just as she finishes viewing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archway functions as more than setting - it's the canvas for revelation and the site of the covenant's test. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("wind keened," "grey, featureless blur"). The arranged driftwood/stones pattern that saves her directly constrains her choice and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly: artistic curiosity → understanding the covenant → survival against the wave. The protagonist's agency drives each escalation, and the cost is visible (she's now bound to remember and rebuild). The wave provides external pressure that forces immediate application of her new knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "scaffolding complexity with simplicity" - ancient wisdom persists in simple patterns. The ending reframes her art as a language she's "finally beginning to read." Slight deduction for the somewhat explicit final paragraph reflection on disconnection/reconnection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with artistic perception ("gnarled burl," "sea's castoffs"). The POV filters details appropriately through Elara's sculptor's eye. Some register elevation in places ("timewoven alliances," "turbine-hum reverie") that slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("turbine-hum reverie," "timewoven alliances"). Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple functions. Minor issues with elevated diction and one instance of telling rather than showing ("Her life's work was no longer just about shaping wood").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of driftwood art, magic lantern technology, and ancient covenants. The specific solution - arranging debris to channel the wave using ancient knowledge - feels earned and non-obvious. The transformation of artistic practice into cultural custodianship offers genuine originality.</comment>
