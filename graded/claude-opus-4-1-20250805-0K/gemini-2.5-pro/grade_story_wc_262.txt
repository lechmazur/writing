I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered sensory details and psychometric visions toward a conceptual repricing about where unused love resides.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete psychometric reading. The shift from seeking to finding unused love lands with earned insight. Arthur's character emerges vividly through Elara's vision, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("strange and aching"). The final realization about love becoming "the soul of a place" feels earned through accumulated detail.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Conceptual Repricing closure: unused love isn't stored but absorbed into place itself. The psychometric vision builds causally from touch to scent to full reconstruction. Cost is felt in Arthur's unrequited devotion and the "melancholic melody" that persists. The accumulative lens holds throughout without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Orpheum Grand constrains and enables the entire story - from dusty projection booth to empty theater to absorbed love in velvet seats. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("dust...tasted of rust and regret"). The setting literally becomes the answer to Elara's question, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding where unused love is stored) deepens through psychometric reading that reveals Arthur's ritualistic documentation. Escalation occurs through accumulation rather than reversal. The cost lands in Arthur's perpetual separation and the theater's haunted atmosphere, though the pressure could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete discovery that unused love transforms physical spaces. The final insight reweights the opening "dust...of regret" into something sacred. Subtext operates through Arthur's filmed letters - documenting love itself rather than sending it. The resolution avoids moralizing while offering genuine revelation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout - Elara experiences through psychometric reconstruction ("spatially imaginative mind"). The prose modulates effectively between present observation and vision state. Some filter verbs appear but serve the psychometric conceit. Voice maintains consistency through the vision without losing Elara's perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density is high throughout. Minor issues: "strange and aching" edges toward abstract; "perfect testament" could be more specific. The opening line and closing image create effective bookends. No significant loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The psychometry concept offers a fresh angle on exploring unrequited love through objects. Arthur's ritual of filming love letters is genuinely original. The answer that love becomes "the soul of a place" transforms the haunted theater trope. Risk-taking in the layered temporal structure pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
