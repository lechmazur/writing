I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens** based on its lyric mode, pattern of memory dissolution, and the way density increases toward the crystallized final image.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "discover the texture of time" drives every choice, from building the hyperbolic maze to handling the fragment despite its consuming effect. His internal conflict between holding and releasing the fragment manifests physically ("clutched the fragment in his pocket now, its soft thrum a constant, terrifying comfort"). The final renunciation—using the maze's geometry to dissolve the fragment—carries visible cost as he loses all memories but gains freedom from temporal prison.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis: Elias breaks the fragment's hold but pays with total memory loss, creating a clear before/after. The accumulative pattern of memory dissolution builds through concrete images (mother's hand, drafting pen, wife's laughter) toward the final crystallized moment where "every memory perfectly clear, sharp, and whole. Then, they all vanished at once." The cost is unmistakable in "He felt no memories, no past, no name."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hyperbolic maze functions as both setting and constraint, its "curved passage that should have led him outward but instead delivered him to the maze's impossible center." The living bridge and hedge leaves become projection surfaces for memories. The maze's non-Euclidean geometry directly enables the resolution, though some spatial choreography remains abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from intellectual curiosity to existential threat as memories progressively dissolve—first edges ghosting, then faces blurring, finally complete dissolution threatened. The fragment's consumption of time creates mounting pressure through concrete losses (wife's face becoming "a blur, her voice a wash of static"). Elias's agency drives the climactic choice to weaponize the maze's geometry against the fragment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of seeking time's texture only to be consumed by it: "it felt like sandpaper, grinding him down to dust." The final image of walking paths "for the very first time" resonantly reprices the entire quest—freedom from time's weight requires sacrificing its texture entirely. No explicit moralizing; the cost speaks through absence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevation appropriate to the concept ("retrocognitively trapped, a ghost haunting the hallways of his own history"). Some register drift occurs in peak moments ("the sheer weight and breadth of every second that had ever been") but serves the disorientation. The perceptual signature of memories as physical projections on leaves distinguishes the POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("The fragment did not shatter; it simply ceased to be solid") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("symphony of patient growth...cacophony of collapsing moments"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("memories...memory...recall" in close succession). Information density remains high in crucial beats, particularly the dissolution sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The hyperbolic maze as memory prison offers fresh inflection on labyrinth tropes. The concept of crystallized light that consumes rather than reveals time transforms the quest narrative. The specific synthesis of non-Euclidean geometry with temporal dissolution feels earned, though some elements (ancient yew, halo fragment) lean toward familiar archetypes.</comment>
