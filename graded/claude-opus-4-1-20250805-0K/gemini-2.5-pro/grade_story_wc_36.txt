I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered reflection and symbolic arrangement toward a resonant insight about failure and understanding.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (arranging driftwood, playing the flute differently). The insight about treating the flute "like a hammer when it was meant to be a needle and thread" shows genuine character understanding earned through scene. However, the emotional progression relies heavily on reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kaelen's understanding reweights his past failure with visible emotional cost ("clean, sharp pain"). The accumulative structure coheres well through the ritual arrangement leading to insight. Orientation is clear early. Minor deduction for the insight arriving somewhat abstractly rather than through more dramatized discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Thunder-echo range functions as more than backdrop - the "canyon hush" and "lines of power" directly enable Kaelen's ritual. Strong sensory work with "avalanchingly quiet pressure" and the shimmer effect. The driftwood arrangement constrains his actions meaningfully. Slightly abstract at times ("geological certainty bleeding into soft, grey possibility").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding his failure) progresses through concrete steps: arrangement, uncasing, playing differently, receiving insight. The pressure builds appropriately under the accumulative lens through density increase. Cost is visible in the "crushing insight" and sustained grief. However, lacks a strong tightening that forecloses options - the insight arrives without significant resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the contrast between force and navigation, walls versus tides, hammer versus needle. The final image of Kaelen holding the flute while "the canyon held his grief, and now, it held his understanding too" offers resonant closure without stating a moral. Strong integration of theme with character arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled, literary prose ("deliberate grace of a man who had nothing left but purpose"). POV remains stable and close third. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("avalanchingly quiet") but mostly serves the contemplative tone. Strong perceptual signature in how Kaelen notices the canyon's qualities.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variety and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is solid. Some overwriting in metaphorical passages ("cathedral of silent, waiting stone," "empires of rock rise and fall"). Minor repetition of "failure" concept without sufficient variation. No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of using music/sound to navigate rather than defend between worlds offers a fresh angle on portal fantasy tropes. The specific ritual with driftwood arrangement feels original. However, the guardian-who-failed premise and mystical insight through meditation are somewhat familiar. The execution elevates common elements through specificity.</comment>
