<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation through patient listening is consistent and embodied through concrete micro-choices (bringing his mug, sitting on the wall, waiting). The final choice to use the locket as key is earned through accumulated neighborhood memories, though internal contradiction could be sharper during the discovery moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as fragments of memory coalesce into solution, with clear closure when the locket opens the mailbox and reveals Mrs. Gable's final wish. Cost is visible in the community's healing process and the decade of garden funding. Orientation anchors (Elias, courtyard, morning) establish early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The locket's physical details (filigree pattern, raised back) become functionally essential when revealed as the key's shape. The courtyard setting enables community gathering and story-sharing, though sensory detail could be more selective under the POV's curator expertise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from threatened drill to community preservation through accumulated storytelling pressure. Each neighbor's fragment tightens the solution path toward the locket-as-key revelation, with visible cost in the community garden funding that honors Mrs. Gable's memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of listening-as-healing emerges through concrete action rather than statement, culminating in the contrast between violent drilling and patient understanding. The final image of neighbors sharing stories while the official letter lies forgotten resonantly answers the central question without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent curator-perspective with selective attention to object details and community fabric. Dialogue differentiates characters naturally (Mrs. Petrov's "reedy hum," Mateo's child-like announcement), though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("conviction as deep and quiet as a desert night").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose generally clear with purposeful rhythm variation, though some elevated diction strains ("sandstorm calm in the swirling anxiety"). Minor template cadence in middle section neighbor encounters. Information density high in the locket discovery sequence where description serves function.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The locket-as-literal-key transformation offers a fresh angle on the mystery genre through community storytelling. The specific synthesis of curator expertise with neighborhood memory-gathering feels earned, though the central metaphor of listening-heals could push beyond familiar territory.</comment>
