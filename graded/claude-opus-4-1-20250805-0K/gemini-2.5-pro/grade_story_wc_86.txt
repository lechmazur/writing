<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "recycle mistakes into wisdom" is embodied through the brass lion drawer pull, creating layered internal conflict between past failure and present duty. The moment where "forgiveness, for the Citadel or for himself, had not yet arrived" shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously rather than alternating. Minor deduction for Kaelen remaining somewhat functional despite good mirroring work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the exchange completes but forgiveness remains withheld, with the drawer pull's "dividend of life" marking visible cost. The moon-phase protocol creates persistent constraint throughout. Minor deduction: the "tragedy" backstory could be more specific to strengthen causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The parapet setting actively constrains the exchange ("too high and too exposed for treachery"), while mist and wind create atmospheric pressure. The lockbox mechanism and lunar marking integrate setting with plot mechanics. Spatial choreography during the exchange is clear and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moon-phase protocol creates escalating pressure through its rigid stages, with the exchange moment crystallizing as "that space between apology and forgiveness." The brass key's dual function (personal anchor/literal key) tightens options. Cost is visible but could be more visceral in the prisoners' release moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central image of recycling tragedy into wisdom without stating it explicitly. The final line about wisdom casting "a brief, hopeful light upon the path" reweights the entire exchange as incremental progress rather than resolution. The drawer pull accumulates meaning from tragedy to key to warm anchor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Elias notices textures ("mist tasted of salt and old stone") and interprets others through his own burden. Voice maintains consistent formality matching the diplomatic tension. Minor repetition in "mist/grey" imagery slightly dulls distinctness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong opening line establishes voice and atmosphere immediately. Information density high in protocol description and exchange mechanics. Some figurative density in atmospheric description ("churning grey sea, swallowing") without clear payoff; "furrowed hush" feels slightly strained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The moon-phase protocol as trust mechanism is fresh, avoiding typical prisoner exchange tropes. The drawer pull as both personal anchor and literal key shows ingenuity. Execution is competent but doesn't risk bold structural choices that might elevate further.</comment>
