I'll evaluate this story through the lens of **Accumulative/Textural** - the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where captured light coalesces into presence.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's obsessive quest is grounded in consistent, embodied detail ("heart hammered against his ribs"), and his final acceptance of the presence shows earned transformation. The motivation remains clear throughout, though the dream's nature stays abstract until closure, slightly limiting emotional specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds through repeated sunrise captures toward the resonant reconfiguration when light coalesces into "a warm, shimmering presence." The closure lands with felt cost ("aching void...finally filled") and the pattern holds consistently. Minor deduction for the dream remaining somewhat abstract until the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago setting constrains choices effectively - Silas must navigate to the easternmost islet for each attempt. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("steel-grey water," "scent of old paper and sea salt"). The petrified wood palette and its light-absorbing properties directly enable the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (capturing the runaway dream) drives consistent pressure through accumulation. The fog-diffused morning provides the key escalation that enables closure. Cost is visible in "years" of failed attempts and the "aching void" that gets filled, though the middle lacks a distinct tightening moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of capturing light to vitalize absence. The final transformation from "luminous absence" to "living, breathing glow" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The cipher concept integrates fully with the accumulative method.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled, lyrical diction ("hush of improbable beginnings") that maintains consistency. The perceptual signature focuses on light and color in character-specific ways. No dialogue to evaluate, but the internal voice remains coherent through emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor figurative density in places ("galaxy in miniature") but serves the accumulative pattern. Clean grammar and momentum throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of capturing light in a palette to reconstruct a dream shows genuine originality. The synthesis of photography, watercolor, and light-painting creates a unique magical system. Risk-taking in the abstract dream concept pays off through specific execution (+0.3 within band).</comment>
