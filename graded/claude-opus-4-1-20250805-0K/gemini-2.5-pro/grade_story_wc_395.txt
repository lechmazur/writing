<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's obsessive search for her brother drives every choice with clear emotional stakes, and her lie to Kael shows contradictory impulses (protecting truth vs. maintaining cover) acting in scene. The "brightly attentive" trait enables her pattern recognition but lacks visible cost trade-offs. Final choice to forward Julian's data earns closure through prior causality with career/safety cost implied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal drive: numbers discovery → coordinate recognition → server breach → truth revelation → whistleblowing action, with each beat tightening options. Closure lands as Decisive Change when Elara forwards the data, transforming her from searcher to whistleblower with implied professional/legal cost. The "inconvenient truths" line crystallizes the conceptual reweight effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Digital environment constrains search methods and the Seraphim-7 patch bridges virtual/physical realms meaningfully. Server architecture and quarantine zones shape Elara's tactics throughout. However, the corporate office physical space remains vague, missing opportunities for embodied tension during Kael's confrontation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly: personal search → pattern discovery → security breach → supervisor confrontation → whistleblowing decision. Kael's appearance forces immediate tactical shift (lying) with palpable tension. Cost becomes visible when Elara chooses truth over safety, though the specific professional consequences could be more explicit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete discovery: corporate burial of inconvenient truths, memory as resistance, deleted things persisting in hidden spaces. The Seraphim-7 "beautiful failure" motif resonates with Julian's doomed whistleblowing attempt. Final image of bringing hidden truths "back into the light" reweights the entire search without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct technical voice with selective perception ("tomb-like quiet," "pinprick of light") fitting Elara's role. Brief dialogue with Kael carries effective subtext and threat. Some register elevation in closing paragraph ("inconvenient truths were hidden") slightly exceeds established voice but doesn't obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations matching tension levels. Information density high in discovery sequences. Minor redundancy in "sensed absence" concept (appears 3 times) and slight overwriting in metaphors ("digital constellations," "ghost data") but these don't touch closure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on digital archaeology/corporate whistleblowing through the abandoned social network frame. The audio-tagging-as-surveillance twist transforms expected data recovery into political scandal. Seraphim-7 coordinates as password shows specific ingenuity, though the corporate malfeasance revelation follows familiar patterns.</comment>
