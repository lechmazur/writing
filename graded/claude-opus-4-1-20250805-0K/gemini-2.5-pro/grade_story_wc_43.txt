<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving toward the "flawless goodbye" with concrete actions (finding the record, calling Lena). The final choice to slip away shows professional restraint with emotional cost visible in the tear. Minor deduction for Mr. Aris remaining largely passive and Lena's quick capitulation lacking internal resistance on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as details (tea steam, record crackle, hand-holding) build toward the resonant reconfiguration of reunion. Closure lands with visible cost in the tear and the death before sunrise. The piece teaches its pattern of sensory accumulation early and pays it off. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of Lena's arrival.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Eyrie's "pulsing stillness" and cloud-sea setting create atmospheric pressure throughout. Specific details like "gravity-spun blanket" and "radiant floor" build the otherworldly hospice. The broken vinyl constrains choices and charges the final image. Setting enables the isolation that makes reunion meaningful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of achieving the "flawless goodbye" drives escalation through Elara's investigation, difficult call, and orchestration. The resistance from Lena creates genuine pressure that tightens when she arrives. Cost is visible in the tear and death. Slightly mechanical resolution once Lena arrives reduces tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the broken/whole record metaphor and the "hymning the mundane" practice without stating morals. The final image of reunion despite brokenness resonates. "The scent of hope" manifests in the tea steam mixing with "ozone" rather than being declared. Strong integration of healing through ordinary gestures.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled register ("a serene hospice music therapist," "pulsing stillness"). Dialogue between Elara and Lena carries subtext and advances plot efficiently. POV remains stable in close third. Minor deduction for slightly elevated diction ("hymning the mundane") that occasionally feels writerly rather than organic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition ("pulsing stillness" echoes effectively). Strong sensory details and information density. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("roadmap of translucent skin and blue veins") and slightly precious phrasing ("hymning the mundane," "decisively kind force").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gravity-spun hospice above clouds offers fresh setting. The broken record as memory shard transforms a familiar reconciliation plot. Some elements feel assembled rather than inevitable (the specific 1957 pressing detail). The "hymning the mundane" concept, while unique, doesn't fully integrate with the reconciliation arc.</comment>
