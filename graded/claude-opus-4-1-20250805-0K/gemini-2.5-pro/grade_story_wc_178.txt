I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered details and ritual preparation toward a resonant revelation rather than causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kavi's motivation is clear and consistent—his "encrypted devotion" to uncovering cosmic truth through mathematical precision. His internal state effectively combines scientific rigor with spiritual yearning, particularly in "This was the moment where logic was meant to blossom into miracle." The character earns his revelation through methodical preparation, though the lack of meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses during the ritual prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Kavi's discovery of the hidden star-cloud, with clear cost in his "lifetime of thrift...spent in a single, glorious act." The accumulative structure builds effectively through ritual preparation to revelation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraphs, and the piece maintains coherent pressure under its textural lens through the midpoint turn at "Tonight, his lifetime of thrift would be spent."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ziggurat observatory and Babylonian palace create vivid, specific setting that constrains Kavi's choices—his isolation enables the secret ritual. Sensory details like "glazed brick that clawed at the violet sky" and "polished obsidian dust" serve the atmosphere effectively. The setting directly enables the climactic alignment between earthly diagram and celestial patterns, though more tactile engagement with the physical space during the ritual would strengthen the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exchanging "a piece of his soul for a glimpse of its true face"—establishes early and pays off through the star-cloud revelation. Escalation builds through accumulation of ritual details rather than reversals, appropriate to the textural lens. The cost is visible in spending his "lifetime of thrift" and the permanent, isolating nature of his "untranslatable truth," though the lack of genuine obstacles or resistance limits higher scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between empirical observation and mystical revelation, crystallizing in "logic was meant to blossom into miracle." The final image of Kavi keeping his cosmic treasure "in the vault of his quiet, devoted mind" while earthly power changes hands below creates resonant contrast. The piece avoids explicit moralizing, letting the particulars of mathematical devotion and celestial discovery carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent erudition appropriate to an astronomer-mystic, with controlled rhythm that mirrors Kavi's methodical nature. Phrases like "hollowed-out days" and "the universe breathing in" demonstrate distinct texture. The perceptual signature stays focused on mathematical and astronomical details throughout, though occasional elevated diction ("catechism was written in prime numbers") slightly strains the naturalistic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the ritual sequence. Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or plot simultaneously. Some figurative density in places ("spiraling tower of glazed brick that clawed at the violet sky") and occasional abstract phrasing ("sealed his covenant not with a promise, but with a shared secret") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of ancient Babylonian astronomy with mystical mathematics offers a fresh angle on the scholar-mystic archetype. The specific detail of using a magic square as cosmic key and the notion of "encrypted devotion" create originality. The interregnum setting adds political texture that enriches rather than distracts, though the core concept of hidden celestial knowledge through ritual isn't entirely novel.</comment>
