I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows a clear because/therefore chain from Elias's belief through his experiment to the devastating revelation that changes his understanding.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong characterization with clear motivation rooted in grief and scientific obsession. The contradictory impulses between mystic belief and scientific method create genuine tension. The final realization lands with earned devastation, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("desolate clarity").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Decisive Change closure lands powerfully - Elias's theory is proven correct but in a brutally literal way that destroys his emotional framework. The cost is visceral: "the earth beneath him was now made of broken steel and indifferent physics, not love." The causal chain from setup through experiment to revelation is tight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quartz arbor and frosted windshield function as more than setting - they enable the crucial experiment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("feathery detail," "spectral essence"). The environment constrains and shapes the revelation, though some descriptions lean slightly purple.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking communion to confronting mechanical truth. The dominant stake (proving objects absorb emotions) is tested and transformed when proven true but emotionally devastating. Cost is legible in Elias's physical collapse and worldview shattering.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the reversal - the "truthful lie" becomes horrifyingly literal. The final image of "broken steel and indifferent physics" reweights everything without moralizing. The story resists sentiment while exploring grief's desperate constructions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent POV. Some elevated diction fits the mystic-scientist character but occasionally strains ("lattice of pale, crystalline stone"). The perceptual signature is clear - a mind seeking meaning in physical phenomena.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("quiet solemnity," "brittle layer"). Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple elements. Minor figurative excess in places but doesn't obscure the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief narrative with scientific mysticism. The reversal - objects remember literally, not poetically - is genuinely surprising yet inevitable. The specific detail of the sheared bolt diagram transforms a potentially sentimental premise.</comment>
