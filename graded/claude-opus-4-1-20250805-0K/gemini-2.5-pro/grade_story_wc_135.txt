<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation as archivist-healer is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment through his reactive visions when touching objects. The old woman's transformation from despair to resolve provides earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("hearten the survivors") but the final choice to continue searching shows clear value hierarchy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens coheres through tide rhythms and fragment accumulation toward the resonant reconfiguration when the woman recognizes her husband's valve. Cost is visible in her "trembling finger" and the "failed heroism" revelation, though the closure could land harder. The piece teaches its pattern early through Kaelen's methodical collecting and pays it off when a single object transforms into human story.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ivory harbor's "slick, pale stones" and tide-line detritus create vivid tactile setting that constrains Kaelen's work to specific rhythms. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"soft, sucking sounds," salt-mist taste. The workshop's labeled fragments function as micro-setting that enables the recognition scene and charges the final image of waiting city.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether fragments can restore meaning to the shattered city, tested when the woman's recognition validates Kaelen's work. The tightening occurs through her transformation from weariness to resolve, though escalation remains gentle. Cost appears in the "failed heroism" and broken trumpet, but pressure could intensify further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of tidal offerings—"Nothing is ever completely lost. It just waits to be found and remembered." The valve transforms from metal artifact to human story of desperate love. Some explicit thematic statement ("foundation of their home, though broken, was still here") but earned through the woman's visible transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elegiac tone with controlled rhythm—"The tide receded from the ivory harbor." Perceptual signature clear in how Kaelen reads absence through barnacle patterns and worn shoes. The woman's dialogue ("The north-gate horn") carries authentic subtext of loss. Minor register elevation but serves the archival perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence lengths and selective detail. Information density high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes simultaneously. Some elevated diction ("liminal space," "reactively visionary") and occasional abstraction ("narrative of their shattered city") but clarity remains. Strong opening and closing images bracket the piece effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The ocean-spray archivist role offers fresh perspective on post-catastrophe recovery through physical archaeology of emotion. The reactive vision ability provides specific mechanism for memory recovery. While exile-return narratives are familiar, the focus on tactile fragments and tidal rhythms provides particular texture that avoids generic post-disaster templates.</comment>
