<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's competence balanced with genuine constraint creates believable motivation, and his final choice to demonstrate expertise through silence rather than boasting shows consistent character logic with visible social cost. The contrast between his and Kaelen's methods drives authentic conflict. Minor deduction for slightly predictable arc of quiet expertise triumphing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkage from storm-disabled systems to manual navigation to cipher-key solution. Closure lands as Decisive Change when Silas proves his methods' superiority, with social/professional cost visible in Kaelen's deflation. Orientation anchored cleanly by ~100 words. Slight deduction for cost being primarily external rather than deeply personal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm constrains navigation choices directly (compass useless, forcing celestial navigation), and the container labyrinth's vertical architecture shapes Silas's tactical advantages. Sensory detail of "poisoned bruise" sky and aurora's "sickly green tendrils" creates atmospheric pressure. The manufacturer's plate detail that enables the climactic solution exemplifies setting-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional challenge to validation of entire methodology, with Kaelen's arrogance providing coherent pressure. The coin flip represents genuine decision point under uncertainty. Cost materializes in Kaelen's visible defeat and the power dynamics shift. Slightly limited by single-beat resolution without deeper personal stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of quiet competence versus loud authority emerges organically through concrete actions—Silas's descent, soft-soled boots, whispered victory. The final line "The walls listen... you couldn't hear their answer" offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates cleanly in gesture and silence throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Silas identifying walks "like a sommelier identifies vintages" and his navigation by sound/silence. Voice maintains consistent control with purposeful modulation between narration and spare dialogue. Minor convergence in register during technical description of the cipher-key sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density high in descriptive passages. Deductions for template cadence in "He pulled... He didn't consult... He unfolded" sequence and slight overwriting in metaphorical density ("poisoned bruise," "sickly green tendrils," "hollow as the container") within opening beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cipher-key mechanism offers fresh specificity within familiar David-versus-Goliath framework. "Calculated spontaneity" concept manifests cleverly in the coin flip moment. However, core premise of analog expertise versus digital dependence during system failure is somewhat expected, limiting higher scoring.</comment>
