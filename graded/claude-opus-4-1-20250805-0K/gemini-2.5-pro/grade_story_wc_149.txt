I'll evaluate this story through the lens of **Accumulative/Textural** - the piece builds through density increase and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lyra's spectral debt payment transforms Elian's understanding and capability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's progression from unease to understanding is well-embodied through concrete actions (finding the bead, experiencing bone-deep chimes). The ghost bride Lyra manifests clear motivation through her "lovingly venomous" influence. Minor deduction for the final paragraph's slight drift toward explanation over embodiment, though the cost remains visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure building from glimpses to full manifestation. The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration as the knowledge transfer completes and Lyra dissolves, with clear cost in their "lost life." The orientation anchors (greenhouse, winter, Elian) establish cleanly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively shapes events - the "alchemical orchard" enables the supernatural manifestation, plants respond to Lyra's influence with "intoxicatingly toxic" perfumes. The Night Phalaenopsis serves as environmental catalyst for the final transformation. Setting constrains and enables the closure effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from mysterious presence to dangerous beauty to full revelation. The "lovingly venomous" tension between nurturing and harm creates genuine pressure. The final knowledge transfer carries clear cost - Lyra's dissolution and the weight of "their shared promise" that Elian must now bear alone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of poisonous love and debt across death. The "lovingly venomous" concept resonates throughout without explicit moralizing. The final image of Elian holding the warm bead while "his work...was just beginning" reweights all prior haunting as preparation rather than torment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with evocative perceptual signature ("breath a lonely cloud," "marrow of his bones"). Some elevated diction ("spectral executor," "exquisite sadness") slightly strains the established register. The voice modulates appropriately with emotional intensity, particularly in the recognition scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("bubble of glass against a tapestry of endless night"). Minor density issues with stacked modifiers ("sorrowful splendor," "mournful elation," "fierce devotion") and some abstract phrasing ("resonant awakenings," "spectral executor"). The final paragraph contains mild paraphrase loops that slightly dull momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "lovingly venomous" ghost bride concept offers fresh specificity - poison that nurtures, debt paid through dangerous beauty. The alchemical greenhouse setting and century-blooming orchid avoid generic haunting tropes. The resolution through knowledge transfer rather than exorcism provides an earned, non-obvious conclusion.</comment>
