<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's internal struggle between fighting and accepting his memory creates genuine contradictory impulses that act in scene, particularly in the transition from treating the tablet as map to understanding it as codex. The final choice to accept rather than fight the painful memory is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in losing his gravity-defying ability.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Kael accepts the source memory and becomes whole again, with the cost being his unique ability to defy gravity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the story builds through pattern recognition and deepening understanding rather than causal events, culminating in a reweighting of his fractured existence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The viaduct's shifting geometry and "darkening brightness" effectively constrain Kael's choices, forcing him to abandon physical navigation for mental acceptance. The glowing structure functions as both prison architecture and psychological landscape, though some descriptive passages lean abstract rather than viscerally grounded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through deepening understanding—from seeing the tablet as map to recognizing it as algorithmic codex, then realizing he must retrace not physical but foundational steps. The cost becomes legible when accepting the memory dissolves his fractured selves but removes his defining ability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The labyrinth-of-self concept emerges organically through the procedural generation metaphor and fractured timeline imagery without explicit moralizing. The ending's transformation from supernatural floater to grounded whole person offers a resonant answer about accepting rather than escaping trauma, though "conquering the labyrinth" edges toward stated theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent philosophical-poetic register appropriate to Kael's looping existence, with effective rhythmic control in passages like "the drop and the ripple, the cause and its infinite, splintering consequences." Some passages drift into abstract register ("procedural generation," "foundational logic") that slightly disrupts the dreamlike texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful imagery, particularly in sensory details like "Rain had just ceased, leaving the air tasting of ozone and wet metal." However, abstract conceptual language ("procedural generation," "algorithm for the maze") and some repetitive phrasing around memory and cycles create occasional density without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fractured timeline/procedural generation concept offers a fresh angle on trauma loops, transforming video game logic into psychological architecture. The specific synthesis of gravity defiance as dissociation mechanism and the viaduct as generated prison shows genuine originality, though some elements feel slightly derivative of time-loop narratives.</comment>
