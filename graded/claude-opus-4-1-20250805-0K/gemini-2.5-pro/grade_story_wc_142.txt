I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows a clear because/therefore chain from problem identification through solution implementation to observed effect.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's dual nature (orderly intuitive navigating chaos) creates genuine internal contradiction that drives his solution. The "torment of dual allegiance" manifests concretely in his method choice. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("simple and agonizing") rather than fully embodied states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kael's intervention reweights the Revel's chaos into hidden order, with clear cost ("hadn't saved the Revel from changing"). The causal chain from problem through graffiti-encoded reorganization to inspector confusion lands cleanly. Slight deduction for marginally late orientation of the Consortium threat's specifics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Revel's sensory chaos ("thrum through worn soles," "calliope music, sizzling fry-oil") contrasts beautifully with encoded order. The graffiti art transformation from decoration to functional ledger constrains choices and charges the ending. Environment actively shapes the solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds from whispered threat through secret reorganization to the inspector's confusion, with clear cost at each turn. The dominant stake (preserving the Revel's soul while surviving gentrification) tightens effectively. Minor deduction for the inspector arriving "weeks ahead" feeling slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of using chaos to create order, avoiding explicit moralizing. The foundation stone chip subtly links past escape to present survival strategy. The ending reweights the art from chaotic expression to survival language without stating the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct voice filters the carnival through Kael's orderly perception ("instinctively charted paths"). The prose modulates effectively between descriptive richness and action. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in places ("phantasmagoric beasts") that doesn't fully match Kael's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Some overwriting in figurative language ("tidal wave of corporate order," "symphony of calliope music") and occasional elevated diction ("phantasmagoric," "anarchic soul") that slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival setting with corporate threat creates non-obvious tension. The graffiti-as-secret-ledger solution transforms expected resistance narrative. The specific detail of the Revel's floating nature and encoded art system elevates beyond template gentrification story.</comment>
