I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward a resonant transformation rather than strict causal mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's crystallizing affliction creates genuine embodied tension, with contradictory impulses between scholarly logic and folk wisdom driving the climactic choice. The transformation from intellectual approach to emotional acknowledgment is earned through specific named scars ("Hesitation," "Pride"). Minor deduction for slightly abstract emotional processing in places.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from crystalline affliction through failed scholarly attempts to grandmother's wisdom, culminating in a Decisive Change where naming transforms physical scars. The cost is visible as Elian abandons his academic identity. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating platform and crystalline veins create atmospheric pressure, with the "ocean of silent, blue air" and "abyss below" adding vertiginous stakes. The crow quill transforms from writing instrument to tracing tool, constraining the final choice. Some setting details remain ornamental rather than fully pressurizing action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from physical affliction through failed runic attempts to the spreading crystallization ("fresh prickle of anxiety"), forcing Elian's choice between scholarly pride and folk wisdom. The cost manifests as surrendering academic certainty. Could benefit from sharper intermediate pressure between setup and resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between academic knowledge and emotional truth, with the final insight that "the most powerful runes were not always written with ink, but spoken from the heart." The transformation of scars into "named and witnessed things" resonates without moralizing, though some thematic statements edge toward explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive formal register suits the rune scholar POV, with controlled syntax maintaining the "saturated hush" tone. Some filter constructions ("he had tried," "he had learned") dull immediacy. The shift from analytical to emotional perception tracks well but occasionally lapses into elevated diction that strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though some template cadence appears ("He drew...He was...He picked up"). Minor paraphrase loops around the crystalline affliction concept. The final paragraph contains some redundancy that slightly dulls the closure impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystallizing stress affliction offers a fresh literalization of emotional scarring, and the synthesis of runic scholarship with folk wisdom creates non-obvious depth. The specific named scars and transformation through acknowledgment rather than erasure shows genuine originality, though the wise grandmother trope is familiar.</comment>
