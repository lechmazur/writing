I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through dense sensory detail and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where light replaces sound as memory's vessel.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is crystal clear - preserving forgotten names drives every action with embodied precision ("surgeon's precision born from the memory of clumsy, grieving hands"). The "snowmelt ardor" physically manifests his internal state against the arctic setting. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "calm had settled in his bones" opening that tells before showing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where light becomes the new vessel for sound's memory, with clear cost in accepting this diminished form of preservation. The accumulative lens holds as density builds through the weaving sequence to the luminous climax. Who/where/when anchored immediately ("last of the wax casters...sanctum was a hollowed dome of glacial ice").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The arctic sanctum actively constrains and enables - its perpetual frost preserves artifacts while the aurora provides the only timepiece. The rope's "phosphorescent threads of sea-kelp" and ice dome's light-filtering properties directly enable the final transformation. Setting becomes instrumental to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the weaving process as Elian transforms absence (holes) into presence (braided pattern), with clear cost in accepting light over sound. The "hours bled into one another" shows time pressure. Escalation is measured but meaningful under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of preservation methods - from failed wax casting to successful light-weaving. The final image of sketching the sigil to cast in silver powerfully reweights the opening's "forgiveness" into active redemption through adapted craft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevated diction befitting a master craftsman ("technically gentle," "snowmelt ardor"). Perceptual signature strong in how Elian reads the punched card as "the language of reeds and air." Rhythm modulates effectively during the weaving sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful with strong information density - most sentences do multiple jobs. Some elevated diction risks purple prose ("ethereal waves," "pearlescent radiance") but remains controlled. The weaving sequence maintains excellent momentum through varied syntax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ancient craft with futuristic preservation creates genuine originality. The concept of translating sound patterns into light through rope-weaving feels inevitable yet surprising. The specific detail of punched cards as memory storage elevates familiar post-apocalyptic material.</comment>
