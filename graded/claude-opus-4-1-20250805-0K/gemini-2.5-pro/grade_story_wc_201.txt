I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric's rigorous standards.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant with Causal elements). The story accumulates sensory and memory fragments toward a conceptual repricing of Kaelen's situation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's proprioceptively enhanced awareness creates a compelling paradox of precision amid displacement. His motivation to find "the mathematics of mercy" emerges organically from trauma. The internal contradiction between his enhanced body-knowledge and lost autonomy drives authentic tension, though the final beat could show more embodied cost rather than intellectual resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Conceptual Repricing when Kaelen realizes he's not being punished but is the experiment's "variable" - transforming victim to participant. The orientation anchors clearly (forest, post-anesthesia state) and causality holds through trauma-triggered memories. However, the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final image, limiting full impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest functions as both setting and antagonist - its "weight," "pressure," and "penance" constraining Kaelen's movement and perception. The bone-white tree and resonant hum create specific environmental pressure that forces his decisive bracing action. Sensory detail ("moss like crushed velvet," "ozone and damp earth") grounds the surreal effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from survival to understanding as Kaelen realizes he must "solve" rather than escape the forest. The bracing sequence shows agency through physical preparation for revelation. The shift from "desperate grip" to "purposeful" hold on the strap marks genuine transformation, though the resolution leans intellectual over visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "displaced rooted" - enhanced perception as both gift and brand. The search for "mathematics of mercy" avoids abstraction by grounding in specific trauma responses. The pewter strap's transformation from desperate talisman to purposeful tool creates resonant non-literal meaning without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains sophisticated control through clinical precision ("proprioceptively enhanced state") contrasting with visceral sensation ("jolt, sharp and electric"). The perceptual signature - hyper-awareness of body position - remains consistent and character-specific. Dialogue from the interrogator ("removing the noise of sentiment") carries chilling subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The anesthesia evaporated like a ghost, leaving a residue of cold clarity"). Some philosophical passages ("mathematics of mercy," "variable they had failed to consider") edge toward abstraction but remain grounded in scene. Strong syntactic variety and momentum throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of remembering through trauma responses offers genuine originality - not just PTSD but weaponized body memory. The transformation from torture victim to experimental variable subverts expectations. "Displaced rooted" creates a fresh paradox, and the proprioceptive enhancement as unwanted gift shows sophisticated thinking about bodily autonomy.</comment>
