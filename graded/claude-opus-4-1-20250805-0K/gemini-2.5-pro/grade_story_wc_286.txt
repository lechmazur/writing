<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in his potter's intuition about places having memory. His act of kindness triggers the revelation, earning the final understanding through concrete action. The transformation from observer to participant is believable, though internal contradiction could be more embodied during peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with the thrum intensifying through acts of care. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Kaelen understands the oasis persists through "accumulated weight of gentle history," with visible cost in his forgetting food/night to rebuild. The pattern teaches early through glass visions and pays off when kindness anchors the place to eternity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The oasis setting constrains choice through its fractured timelines that respond to kindness, making environment essential to revelation. Sensory detail filters through Kaelen's potter perspective ("clay having memory," "alluvial clay, familiar and cool"). The lantern glass functions as micro-setting that enables perception and charges the final understanding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity to physical commitment as Kaelen abandons sustenance to rebuild the channel. The dominant stake—understanding resistance to change—deepens through each act of care that reveals more of the past. Cost is visible in his exhaustion and the "profound silence" that follows completion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the discovery that "kindness was the anchor" keeping places intact. The final image of Kaelen cleaning clay from his hands while his act weaves into the oasis's memory offers a non-literal answer about persistence through care. No moralizing; the concept of phototropic kindness manifests through concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of a potter ("quiet deliberation of water finding its level," clay metaphors throughout). Psychic distance modulates effectively from observation to immersion. Minor filter verb accumulation in middle sections ("He saw," "He understood") slightly dulls immediacy during the vision sequences.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("chimney smoke flattens" signals both time and stillness). Strong rhythm variation matches scene pressure. Some figurative density in vision sequences borders on overwriting but serves the accumulative pattern. Clean syntax and grammar throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of place-memory responding to kindness offers fresh angle on post-apocalyptic persistence. Specific synthesis of potter's craft with temporal perception feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric vision sequences heightens meaning without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
