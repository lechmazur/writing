I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as the piece builds through layered observation and ritual toward a resonant reconfiguration where Kael's empathetic connection with the falling star transforms his understanding of vulnerability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's spiritual curiosity drives concrete ritual actions (tracing stars through yellow glass), and his internal contradiction between isolation and connection manifests through embodied perception during the meteor's descent. The final realization about vulnerability as strength is earned through the visceral shared experience, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("primal elegance").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as Kael experiences the star's "violent, frictional heat" and "incandescent scream," transforming his understanding of dust as "memory of light." The accumulative structure coheres through ritual repetition building to the Perseid moment, with clear orientation and the textural lens holding throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The station's "dormant machinery" and "observation decks" create atmospheric constraint, while the yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting that enables Kael's transformative vision. Sensory detail peaks during the meteor sequence ("fogging the cold metal"), though some descriptions remain abstract ("fertile silence").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation from detached observation to active empathy, with Kael's decision to "feel" rather than just trace marking the key intensification. The cost manifests in his visceral experience of the star's death, though the stakes could sharpen earlier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of finding "strength in vulnerability" emerges organically through the star's journey, avoiding explicit moralizing until the earned final insight. The closing image of dust as "memory of light" offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights Kael's janitorial work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent close-third POV with selective perception filtered through Kael's spiritual lens ("silent cathedral," "chronicler of endings"). Some register elevation occurs ("primal elegance," "incandescent scream") that slightly strains the established voice, and no dialogue tests naturalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("swept drifts of ancient starlight") but suffers from abstract descriptors ("fertile silence," "profound attention") and some template phrasing ("For years, this...," "One cycle..."). The climactic sequence maintains propulsion despite occasional overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of a janitor finding spiritual meaning through empathy with falling stars offers fresh specificity, transforming the custodian trope through concrete ritual. The yellow glass as focus object and the station setting create particular texture, though some philosophical framing feels familiar.</comment>
