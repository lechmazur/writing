I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward Elara's moment of recognition about endings.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—seeking understanding of endings while maintaining clinical distance from others' grief—create genuine complexity. Her internal progression from "grips reality loosely" to profound calm is earned through concrete sensory work. The parasol tip functions as a tangible anchor for her grandmother's beginning while she studies endings, creating embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully when the ice's "deep, resonant sigh of release" provides Elara the exact texture of ending she came to learn. The accumulative structure builds through debris cataloging to ice-calving epiphany with clear cost: she's using others' catastrophe as her classroom. The parasol tip's juxtaposition against endings creates the necessary fold in patience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina functions as both literal disaster site and metaphor for Elara's mental landscape—"solid ground had given way to a slow, inexorable drift." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "salt and diesel fuel," "bruised apricot" ice floes. The calving ice sheet's sound—"prolonged, sighing crackle"—becomes the environment teaching her what she needs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding "the sound of approaching endings"—tightens when the fold in patience appears, creating tension between waiting for comprehension versus waiting for death. The ice-calving provides meaningful deepening that resolves her search. Cost is visible in her acknowledged selfishness and the volunteers giving her "wide berth."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the accumulation of endings—broken yachts, interrupted lives, calving ice—without stating morals. The parasol tip's presence amid devastation creates resonance about beginnings and endings. The final image of "vast and quiet" calm reweights all prior searching, answering her central question through embodied experience rather than epiphany.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent interiority with distinctive perception: "clipped-off sentences of interrupted lives," "windborne solace." The clinical distance—"euthanasia tourist masquerading as a saint"—reflects her emotional state. Slight register elevation in "vast plain of sea-ice" and "crystalline heartbeats" serves the lyric mode without breaking character perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs: "yachts...like broken toys, their masts askew like praying hands" combines description, metaphor, and thematic work. Some figurative density in peak moments ("thousand crystalline heartbeats") but it serves the accumulative pattern. Minor template cadence in "She had wanted...She had registered" opening.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of disaster-tourism for death preparation offers a non-obvious angle on grief and endings. The specific synthesis of recovery work with euthanasia planning feels fresh. The ice-calving as metaphor for letting go transforms familiar imagery through Elara's particular need for comprehension rather than comfort.</comment>
