I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor for a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This story operates under a **Causal** lens - each discovery leads through because/therefore linkages (cracks lead to wall, punch creates portal, portal reveals fortress, fortress reveals mentor's truth, truth transforms Elias's understanding and role).

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and builds through concrete discoveries. The "trembling certainty" effectively embodies his emotional state through physical detail. However, the final transformation from seeker to keeper feels slightly rushed - the acceptance lacks sufficient internal resistance or cost consideration to fully earn the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from dare to discovery to transformation, with the phantom punch as persistent constraint. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias becoming keeper) with visible cost (giving up his cartographer life). Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical revelation sequence in the fortress - truths appear conveniently organized rather than discovered through struggle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cracks-as-language concept effectively makes setting active in guiding choice. The fortress's starlit vault creates atmospheric pressure. However, the transition from alley to fortress lacks sufficient spatial grounding - the "floor of dark, polished stone" appears without orientation, creating brief white-room syndrome before the dome description anchors us.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from finding the fortress to understanding his role as keeper, with the punch serving as key that demands acceptance of responsibility. The "first lock" moment effectively tightens pressure. However, the fortress section lacks active opposition - truths simply appear rather than requiring struggle or sacrifice to access.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mapping/unraveling theme elegantly transforms from physical cartography to existential purpose. The fortress as repository of unbearable truths resonates strongly. The mentor's transformation into guardian provides meaningful thematic closure about the cost of knowledge. Slight deduction for the overly neat catalog of truths that reads more like exposition than earned revelation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in how Elias reads the city's "secret geometry." Controlled psychic distance shifts effectively from external observation to internal realization. Minor weakness in the fortress section where voice briefly loses its distinctive analytical precision, defaulting to more generic wonderment ("profound, silent meaning").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in the opening sequences. Information density is high without overwriting. However, some figurative language strains ("cathedral of space and revelation") and the truth-revelation paragraph contains near-paraphrase loops ("unspoken truth"/"truths too heavy"). The "trembling certainty"/"trembling heart" echo works as intentional callback.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The phantom ticket punch that perforates reality is genuinely fresh, as is the fortress existing as pure space rather than structure. The cracks-as-language concept transforms familiar urban decay into something purposeful. The mentor-becoming-guardian twist reframes the quest meaningfully, though the execution of the revelation sequence itself follows somewhat predictable patterns.</comment>
