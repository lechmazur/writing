I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—refusing to watch trees die, using the Inversion as opportunity. The internal experience during navigation shows good sensory specificity ("vibration that resonated in Elara's teeth and bones"). Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution where finding the shard immediately suggests it will cure the blight without dramatized struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural structure with the Inversion creating a time-bound window for discovery. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara obtains "the planet's memory of strength" that can restore the dying orchards, with implied cost in the dangerous journey through inverted gravity. The seed pod's transformation provides visceral proof of the crystal's power. Slight deduction as the cost could be more explicitly felt in the final moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Exceptional world-building with the gravity inversion creating a lived-in, physically coherent environment. The floating water rivers, "archipelago of stone," and the Anechoic Heart cavern all constrain navigation choices. The arrow relic guides movement through the environment, making setting essential to plot progression. Details like "dust motes from the ochre soil" and "gossamer-fruit trees" create specificity without overwriting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The time-limited Inversion creates genuine pressure—"only minutes" as gravity returns. Stakes escalate from navigating dangerous arches to discovering the crystal's power through the seed pod demonstration. However, the resolution feels somewhat frictionless; Elara obtains the shard without meaningful opposition or sacrifice beyond the inherent danger of navigation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "gathering of echoes" concept elegantly merges with the theme of planetary resilience—accumulated life force stored in silence. The broken arrow as marker rather than weapon subverts expectation meaningfully. The final image of bringing "memory of strength" to a world that needs to "remember how to live" resonates without stating a moral. Slight deduction for the somewhat convenient alignment of cure and quest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with strong perceptual signature—Elara notices "whirling silence," experiences sound as physical sensation. Technical vocabulary ("inertial dampeners," "containment field") fits the pilot character. The prose modulates well between action and wonder. Minor deduction for occasional filter phrases ("She watched, mesmerized") that could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Strong opening and closing lines that bookend the journey. Some figurative language enhances rather than clutters ("liquid road," "silent, weightless ballet"). Deductions for occasional redundancy ("vast, central cavern inside the largest") and one instance of telling that could be shown ("This was the place the stories called").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gravity inversion as access mechanism is inventive, as is the concept of life-force echoes stored in crystalline formation. The subversion of the arrow from weapon to marker shows thoughtful transformation of expectation. However, the quest-for-cure structure itself follows familiar patterns without significant risk-taking in form or resolution.</comment>
