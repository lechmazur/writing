<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find connection through letting go of her twig spiral is earned through concrete embodiment of her isolation as a ghostwriter of others' emotions. The contradiction between holding/releasing plays out in scene with visible cost at the installation. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "thread that connects all things" which could be more concretely embodied earlier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara's act of adding the twig transforms her isolation into connection with visible emotional cost. The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently and builds density through layered contributions to the installation. The cost is legible in her terror at giving away "her last link" and the peace that follows demonstrates genuine transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lotus temple and lily pond create atmospheric pressure through "prismatic quiet" and post-rain sensory detail that mirrors Elara's emotional state. The installation space constrains her choice meaningfully. Deduction because the setting could more actively shape her tactics beyond providing the opportunity—the temple's specific qualities don't alter how she approaches her decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (connection vs isolation) escalates through witnessing others' contributions, building pressure that forces Elara's choice between keeping her talisman or joining the collective work. The cost is clear: "severing her last link" versus remaining "just an archivist of affection." Minor deduction as the pressure could tighten more actively through the middle section.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the installation metaphor—individual secrets woven into collective meaning without stating the moral. The thrush nest spiral transforms from private talisman to "humble, sturdy loop that strengthened the whole structure." The final image of invisible threads radiating from her resonantly answers the central question of connection without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's tendency to see the world in writerly metaphors ("damp silk," "library of longing"). Voice maintains consistency through emotional modulation, though occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("inevitable whimsical," "fractured rainbows"). The POV filters setting details through her specific lens as a keeper of others' secrets.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("prismatic quiet" appears twice, "inevitably whimsical" feels forced) and some abstract phrasing ("thread that connects all things"). The opening and closing lines effectively frame the transformation, and most sentences advance story or atmosphere efficiently.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ghostwriter premise offers a fresh angle on isolation—someone who crafts intimacy for others but lacks her own connection. The public art installation as method for reconnection feels organic rather than convenient. Minor deduction for the somewhat familiar "finding connection through letting go" arc, though it's executed with specific detail.</comment>
