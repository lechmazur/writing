<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's internal conflict between holding onto grief and allowing wonder is embodied through her white-knuckled grip on the lacquered box, then the tender, protective closure of her hand at the end. Elias's motivation to "nurture lifelong wonder" drives his patient, adaptive approach throughout. The transformation from desperate grip to tender protection shows earned change with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the eclipse's stages paralleling Lena's emotional journey. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Lena sees the curl "not just as what she lost, but as proof of what she'd had," with the cost visible in her "tear-streaked face" and sixty years of defining sorrow. The eclipse functions as both literal event and structural device that enables the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sage Ridge's dusty ground and dried sagebrush mirror Lena's brittle emotional state, while the eclipse's "ethereal twilight" and "ghostly ring of fire" create the liminal space for transformation. The earth under Lena's palm becomes tactile setting that enables the key moment: "The life, still humming, still here." Setting constrains and enables the therapeutic work through both physical space and cosmic event.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether Lena can transform sixty years of defining grief into something that includes wonder. The eclipse creates natural escalation through its phases, with pressure tightening as "the world held its breath." The cost is legible when Lena's "desperate" grip becomes "tender, protective"—she hasn't lost the pain but has reconfigured its meaning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the integration of loss and wonder without stating a moral—the eclipse becomes the perfect objective correlative for seeing darkness and beauty simultaneously. The baby curl transforms from "anchor of her sorrow" to "proof of what she'd had," offering a non-literal answer to how grief and wonder can coexist. The final image of Lena's transformed grip embodies the theme without explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent psychic distance with selective perception focused on tactile and visual details that matter to the therapeutic moment. Some filter verbs appear ("he felt the tremor") but serve the intimate POV. Dialogue is minimal but functional, with Elias's "low hum that barely disturbed the air" matching his therapeutic approach, though it lacks distinctive character markers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm that slows during the eclipse sequence to match the held-breath tension. Some elevated diction ("bruised twilight," "ethereal") fits the momentous occasion but occasionally edges toward overwriting. Information density is good—most sentences advance both external action and internal state. Minor template phrasing appears ("trembling fingers," "tear-streaked face") but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The integration of solar eclipse with grief therapy offers a fresh synthesis—using cosmic alignment to enable emotional realignment. The specific detail of "sixty years" of grief over a baby who lived "only a few seasons" grounds the universal in the particular. While grief narratives are common, the eclipse as therapeutic crucible and the precise image of grip transformation provide originality.</comment>
