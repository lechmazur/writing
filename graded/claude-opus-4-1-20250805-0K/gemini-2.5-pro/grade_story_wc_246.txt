<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's guilt and self-imposed exile are powerfully embodied through his interaction with the dried pen and his physical unbending. The internal contradiction between his desire to fix and need to accept creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "threshing meaning" motivation that edges toward therapeutic language in places.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kaelen's unbending represents acceptance with visible cost—the permanent loss of those lives he cannot save. The temporal anomaly discovery escalates meaningfully through testing edits that reveal cascading disasters. Minor deduction for the orientation taking slightly long to establish the gravitational anomaly's specific nature.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly functions as both setting and constraint, its time-folding property enabling the central conflict. The station's weighted silence and warping pressure create atmospheric specificity. The dried pen serves as micro-setting that constrains choice—its uselessness forcing acceptance rather than action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through Kaelen's discovery he can edit history, testing changes that reveal worse disasters, culminating in his choice to add a footnote rather than change the past. The cost is palpable—accepting thousands of deaths rather than creating new catastrophes. One meaningful deepening that forecloses the path of revision with clear price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of accepting irreversible mistakes emerges organically through Kaelen's journey from frantic editing to deliberate unbending. The dried pen transforms from "useless monument" to "testament," earning its symbolic weight through concrete action. Final image resonantly answers whether to correct or understand the past.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice with technical precision befitting a signal interpreter, modulating from clinical distance to desperate hope to final acceptance. Some filter verb clusters ("he felt," "he stared") slightly dull immediacy in middle sections. POV remains stable and the perceptual signature of someone attuned to signals and patterns is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some abstract phrasing ("thresh meaning from that catastrophic experience") and occasional redundancy ("profound stillness settled"). Information density is high in action beats. Minor template cadence in "He..." openings mid-story reduces variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The time-folding anomaly allowing live viewing of the past offers a fresh angle on the time-travel correction trope. The specific twist that every edit creates worse disasters transforms familiar material. The emotional specificity of professional guilt and the concrete detail of the meteoritic pen elevate beyond template.</comment>
