I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens - the story builds through pattern-making with light/shadow, culminating in a resonant exchange rather than causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation as "canal guardian" who teaches "darkness the value of stars" is consistent and embodied through deliberate craft. The character's "spiralingly calm" nature manifests in methodical shutter manipulation, though internal conflict could deepen. The final exchange shows earned understanding between guardian and presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, the piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the darkness acknowledges the light with "soft luminescence" - a genuine exchange with felt cost (loneliness eased). The pattern-teaching through shutter manipulation coheres well. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Cobalt dock gleaming like wet ink" and "water-logged pilings" create vivid specificity. The shutters function as active setting that constrains choice - Kaelen must work with their angles to create the light pattern. The canal's "dark throat" and final "permanent crack" of light charge the closure image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on teaching "darkness the value of stars" - established early and maintained. Escalation occurs through the pattern-weaving sequence building to the dental mirror's "single brilliant mote" penetrating the depths. The soft luminescence response creates meaningful exchange with emotional cost (loneliness acknowledged).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of creating light patterns to communicate with darkness. The final "permanent crack through which a single line of light could always touch the water" offers resonant answer without moralizing - connection requires persistent openings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm: "movements economical and fluid," "spiralingly calm." The perceptual signature focuses on light/shadow gradations fitting the guardian role. Some elevated diction ("mute despair," "resonated") fits the contemplative tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The pattern was not of aggression, but of welcome, a map of gentle inquiry." Some elevated register ("profound sorrow," "absolute resolve") occasionally strains but doesn't obscure. Information flows cleanly through the weaving sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of canal guardian as light-weaver who communicates through shutter patterns. The dental mirror as instrument for directing light into darkness shows ingenuity. The concept of teaching darkness rather than banishing it offers non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
