<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's methodical curiosity and "shielded openness" drive concrete choices throughout—from archival research to frame-by-frame comparison—with her final annotation crystallizing a shift from repair to acknowledgment. The internal tension between preserving and revealing knowledge earns the closure, though some interiority relies on abstractions ("empathetic rush") rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds through layered discovery: tear → archive → footage comparison → lichen disruption → threshold annotation, with each beat narrowing Elara's understanding. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as she shifts from framing known worlds to acknowledging the unknown, with cost visible in the deliberate choice not to repair. Who/where/when anchored early through workshop setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The workshop's "quiet hum of dehumidifiers" and "scent of archival glue" establish professional atmosphere, while the henge's "rain-scoured fresco vault" and lichen patterns constrain discovery method. The films' contrasting atmospheres (1950s sun vs 1990s mist) shape perception, though some descriptions remain functional rather than charging the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional curiosity through the tear's mystery to the revelation of deliberate concealment, with each discovery narrowing options—the lichen disruption forces recognition of human intervention. The final choice between repair and acknowledgment carries professional and ethical weight, though the external pressure remains primarily intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The threshold metaphor elegantly unifies physical tear, stone doorway, and conceptual boundary between known/unknown, with the final annotation reweighting the entire premise. Theme emerges through concrete discovery rather than statement, though the "empathetic rush" paragraph edges toward explicit articulation before recovering through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with distinctive perceptual signature—Elara notices "spider-scratch of ink" and "choreography of light and shadow." Voice modulates effectively from professional precision to breathless discovery ("The silence of the films screamed at her"), maintaining character-specific diction throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clean, purposeful prose with strong information density—most sentences advance discovery or deepen atmosphere. Some figurative language clusters in emotional peaks ("tremor of connection, an empathetic rush that breached her careful shields") without full integration, and occasional abstract phrasing ("resonant silence") could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival detective work with cartographic mystery, using silent film comparison as an unexpected investigative method. The concept of maps as "windows into moments" and tears as deliberate omissions transforms familiar material, though the emotional revelation follows somewhat predictable beats.</comment>
