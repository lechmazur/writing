I'll evaluate this story systematically under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as the piece builds through layered metaphors and pattern recognition toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through the platinum labyrinth manipulation as active thought-process. The internal conflict between pride and duty manifests concretely in his analysis of the chess game. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract resolution moment lacking fuller embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where solving the labyrinth releases the spell, with visible cost in "not the hollow triumph of victory, but the quiet, aching relief of a truce." The accumulative pattern of thread-decoding builds effectively to this crystallized moment. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen village setting directly constrains choice—Elias seeks this timeless space specifically for his confrontation with memory. The tapestry's frayed threads function as micro-setting that enables the solution. Sensory detail selective but vivid: "petrified stone lip," "deafening clang."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative deepening as Elias decodes each thread, with the labyrinth's clicks marking progression. The dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens as he isolates "threads of pride from threads of duty." Cost becomes legible in accepting the "simple, defensive move" over brilliance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the chess metaphor: "Forgiveness... was not the erasure of a bad move, but the wisdom to begin the next game." The labyrinth-as-thought-process avoids heavy symbolism while the tapestry's "peaceful lie" mirrors Elias's false calm. Final image resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm that modulates during the decoding sequence. POV discipline strong—everything filtered through Elias's chess-tutor perception. Slight elevation in diction ("woven hush," "fierce repose") fits the fairy-tale register without breaking character lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose generally clean with purposeful rhythm variation, though some elevated constructions edge toward overwriting ("physical weight," "gut-shaking peal"). Information density high in the decoding sequence. Minor template cadence in "He had to... He began to..." construction but doesn't pervade.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The chess-as-life metaphor gets fresh treatment through the specific detail of choosing brilliance over safety. The spell-frozen village as contemplation space offers an interesting angle. The tapestry cipher adds originality though the self-forgiveness arc follows familiar patterns.</comment>
