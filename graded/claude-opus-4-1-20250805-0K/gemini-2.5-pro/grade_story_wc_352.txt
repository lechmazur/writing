I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story operates through clear because/therefore linkages as Kael's perception of the doodle leads to entering the grotto, which enables finding the combination, forcing his escape before gravity rights itself.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's prism-mind ability creates genuine specificity and his internal drive is well-embodied through concrete actions. The contradiction between preserving dangerous knowledge and protecting humanity adds depth. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract notion of "intellectual plague" that lacks immediate embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from doodle perception through grotto navigation to memorizing the equation creates clear closure with visible cost (physical danger, burden of knowledge). The Earned Stasis of accepting responsibility lands with weight. Orientation anchors early and the because/therefore linkages hold throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The inverted grotto with its stalactites-as-pillars and upward-falling water creates vivid, functional setting that directly constrains movement and creates danger. The obsidian wall as focal point pays off beautifully. Environment actively shapes every choice Kael makes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The gravity inversion creates genuine time pressure and physical stakes that escalate naturally. The cost is visible in Kael's scrambling escape and the "deadly rain" of stones. Stakes tighten effectively from contemplation to action to urgent escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of dangerous knowledge and intellectual vigilance emerges organically through action rather than statement. The final image of Kael as guardian of "internal fire" resonates without moralizing. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract "intellectual plague" concept that could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with elevated diction fitting an archivist's perspective ("prism-minded," "clandestinely luminous"). POV remains stable and the perceptual signature of seeing hidden patterns is consistent. Minor repetition in descriptive patterns ("quiet humming," "quiet guide") creates slight monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure. Some overwriting appears ("breathtaking, lethal inversion," "cold and sharp" panic) and occasional template constructions ("He had to," "He was here because"). Information density is good but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of gravity inversion as portal to hidden knowledge offers freshness, though "chosen one finds ancient wisdom" is familiar territory. The specific execution through the doodle-as-perspective-key and the obsidian wall reflection shows genuine ingenuity. The intellectual plague concept needs more specificity.</comment>
