I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern accumulation (the tickets), cadence shifts, and symbolic density toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between yearning for transparency and inability to find "honest words" drives the piece. The final choice to reveal his watching/collecting is earned through established patterns. Minor deduction for some emotional summarization ("shared and silent sorrow") rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the lens exchange - a crystallized moment where understanding replaces mistrust with visible cost (tears, vulnerability). The accumulative pattern of tickets-to-understanding holds throughout. Slight deduction for the explanatory line about "confessions of a grief" which tells rather than trusts the image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The projector lens constrains choice (becomes his tool for understanding) and the wet cityscape mirrors emotional states effectively. The cenotaph setting enables the revelation. Doesn't quite reach higher bands as some descriptions remain ornamental ("crystal whispering") without driving action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure - each ticket deepens the mystery until Elias must act (leaving his post for the first time in a decade). The cost is visible in his vulnerability and her tear. Pattern-breaking (speaking vs silence) creates the turn effectively under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cryptic drawings perfectly embody unspoken grief - "a key with wings of bone" resonates as both lock and wound. The final lens exchange offers a non-literal answer to their communication crisis. Theme emerges entirely through image and gesture without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elias's careful attention to texture and weight. Effective psychic distance shifts. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("crystal whispering expanse") that slightly exceeds the registrar's natural voice and for some filter-heavy passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. However, several overwrought phrases ("crystal whispering expanse," "dense, ringing silence") and some paraphrase loops ("shared and silent sorrow" restating what's shown). The "confessions of a grief so profound" line explains rather than trusts dramatization.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cryptic ticket drawings are genuinely fresh - using concert memorabilia as a grief language. The specific images (ship on clock faces, spiderweb light) avoid cliché. The lens as confession tool shows originality, though the mistrust-to-understanding arc is somewhat familiar.</comment>
