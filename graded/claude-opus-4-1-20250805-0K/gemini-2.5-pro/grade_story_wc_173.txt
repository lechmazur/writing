I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where Elara's gathering of emotional echoes builds density toward a final release that reweights the city's consciousness.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—harvesting emotional echoes to seed change through returned truths. Her internal state remains controlled throughout, though we lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to release the echoes is earned through her decade-long preparation, with visible cost in the "immense burden she had carried."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively—the prism's release transforms the city's masters by returning their hidden truths. Cost is visible in Elara's "deep, resonant sigh" releasing her burden. The accumulative lens holds as echoes gather toward the climactic release, though the transformation's immediate effects feel slightly too neat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The silver courtyard and prism sanctuary create atmospheric pressure, with snow and starlight reinforcing the piece's ethereal tone. The prism functions as both setting and constraint, requiring specific echoes to complete. However, the courtyard remains somewhat static beyond its visual poetry—it doesn't actively constrain choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear: Elara must complete her decade-long work by adding the judge's echo. The ritual's complexity creates tension through "impossible delicacy" and the risk inherent in "unwinding spiritual afflictions." However, no real opposition threatens the ritual's success—the escalation is more accumulation than contested pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between conformity's "suffocating tune" and Elara's subversive use of intimacy without touch. The final image of "a rebellion in the hearts of her keepers" resonantly answers the central question about change from within. The "revolution of whispers" avoids didactic moralizing while maintaining thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains elegant control with phrases like "ghost in white silk" and "spectral residue of emotions." The POV remains stable, filtering perception through Elara's poetic sensibility. Slight elevation in diction ("psychic weight," "spiritual afflictions") fits the mystical context without breaking character voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves lyrical density with lines like "Each step was a silent verse, her posture a stanza of perfect control." Some overwriting appears ("profound and alarming serenity," "silent, overwhelming wave of pure, colorless light") but doesn't obscure meaning. Information density is high, though occasional redundancy exists ("silent verse"/"stanza of perfect control").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a courtesan who harvests emotional echoes without physical contact offers genuine freshness. The prism sanctuary as a repository for psychic residue feels original. However, the resolution—enlightening oppressors through returned truths—follows a somewhat predictable arc of gentle subversion.</comment>
