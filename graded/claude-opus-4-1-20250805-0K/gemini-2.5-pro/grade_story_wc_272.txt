<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's fragmentation is embodied through concrete physical details (salt-dust on tongue, walls pressing shoulders) and his artistic breakdown manifests in specific visual distortions. The transformation from "crestfallen artist" to "cartographer of the fractured soul" is earned through dramatized action rather than declaration, with visible cost in his blackened fingers and years of struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the lighthouse's circular compression and culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias transforms breakdown into method. The closure lands with felt cost ("years" of quiet, the "luminescent ache" transformed but not erased) and the final image of climbing "back up into the light" reweights his descent as necessary navigation rather than collapse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse's circular room functions as both physical constraint and psychological pressure, with walls that "press" even from the center. Sensory details (salt-dust taste, groaning floorboards, sweeping light-beam metronome) are selective and purposeful, though the library-lighthouse fusion could be more clearly anchored spatially.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres through the lighthouse's suffocating compression that drives Elias to "descend into necessary darkness," with the broken tarot box catalyzing his shift from passive suffering to active redesign. The transformation from crushing walls to "silent witnesses" demonstrates earned agency, though the middle section could tighten the pressure-to-action causality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of navigating fragments rather than repairing wholeness, with the broken tarot box embodying the futility of imposing old systems on chaos. The questioning of platitudes ("what if the current was flowing over a waterfall?") resists easy wisdom, and the final image of mapping pieces rather than fixing them offers a resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinct literary register with controlled metaphorical density ("constellation of disconnected features," "dusty carousel of forgotten knowledge") that reflects Elias's artistic perception. POV remains stable and close-third throughout, with perceptual signature evident in how he sees faces as fragments and reads the lighthouse beam as metronome.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts, particularly in the working sequence where short declaratives mirror methodical action. Some metaphorical density in early paragraphs ("stone cylinder," "dusty carousel," "spiral of his own mind") risks overwriting, and occasional abstract phrasing ("profound relationship," "quiet, resilient sense") could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story transforms the familiar artist-in-crisis narrative through the specific synthesis of cartography and fragmentation—not fixing but mapping the broken. The lighthouse-as-library setting and the broken tarot box as catalyst for redesign rather than repair show genuine freshness, though the descent-and-return arc follows recognizable patterns.</comment>
