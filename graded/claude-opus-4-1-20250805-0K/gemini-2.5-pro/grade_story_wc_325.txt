I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is a **Causal** story - each beat follows because/therefore logic as Elias progresses through the facility to complete his grandmother's work.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's claustrophobia creates genuine internal conflict against his duty-driven mission, with embodied panic ("cold sweat," "tightness gripped") and the phase-transition sequence showing cost through "nauseating, colorless vibration." The grandmother connection motivates credibly but "my grandmother included" POV slip and the somewhat abstract resolution of "peaceful second" before ghosts "winked out" lack the visceral specificity needed for 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from tidal window through obstacle to phase-transition solution to completion, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure ("He was alone, but he was no longer haunted"). The POV slip "my grandmother included" breaks focalization briefly. Cost is present but somewhat abstract - the ghosts' release lacks the visceral weight that would elevate to 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Excellent sensory specificity ("salt and forgotten time," "drip-drip-drip," "heat-shimmer distortions") and the facility constrains choices effectively through the collapse and tidal deadline. The phase-transition passage delivers strong embodied detail. Missing deeper integration of how the specific undersea cable architecture shapes the resolution mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tidal deadline creates urgency, the collapse forces the phase-transition choice, and completing the circuit releases the ghosts - clear escalation under causal lens. However, the resolution feels somewhat mechanical; the ghosts' release lacks struggle or meaningful resistance that would deepen the cost beyond "peaceful" acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of duty to the forgotten emerges through action, with the gold fleck serving as both tool and memorial connection. The ending reweights the "crashing hush" into "true, clean emptiness" effectively. However, the resolution's ease ("peaceful second") undercuts complexity - more ambiguity about whether release equals peace would strengthen thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with Elias's unique ghost-sensing ability and consistent technical vocabulary around the facility. The POV slip "my grandmother included" disrupts otherwise clean focalization. Prose modulates well between technical description and emotional peaks, though some phrases edge toward purple ("fossilized leviathans").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("concrete wound in the cliffside," "crashing hush where the roar of the surf outside met the dead silence within"). Some overwriting in metaphors ("fossilized leviathans," "tombstone for a project") and the abstract "fractured consciousnesses" description. The phase-transition sequence maintains clarity despite complexity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ghost-perception ability and phase-transition solution offer fresh angles on the haunted facility trope. The codex margin gold fleck as both key and memorial object shows ingenuity. However, the peaceful ghost release feels somewhat safe - a more ambiguous or costly resolution would enhance originality.</comment>
