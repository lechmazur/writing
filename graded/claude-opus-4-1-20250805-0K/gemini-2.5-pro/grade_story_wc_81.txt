I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This story operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens - the blackout creates stillness that enables discovery, with density increasing through layered revelations about the stamp, the mark, and the stolen origins, culminating in Elias's quiet commitment to correction.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's methodical perception and quiet moral clarity drive consistent choices throughout. His decision to work alone on "re-indexing the Athenaeum's stolen heart" shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for slightly abstract emotional states ("profound sense of peace") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise - Elias's final commitment to "re-indexing" crystallizes options with clear cost (solitary work against institutional lies). The accumulative revelation (mark→stamp→theft→correction) builds effectively under the textural lens. Slight dock for cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sunken city setting brilliantly constrains and enables - the blackout creates necessary conditions for discovery, phosphorescent moss provides crucial light, crystallized salt preserves evidence. "The slow drip of condensation" and biolamps casting "wavering shadows" create lived-in specificity that shapes Elias's investigation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative deepening - from sensing dissonance to finding the stamp to confirming the match to understanding theft. The blackout as inciting pressure enables rather than forces action. Cost is clear but intellectual rather than visceral ("strange, clarifying calm" rather than felt struggle).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete discovery of "honest origins" versus "sanitized narratives." The coral stamp as maker's mark resonates beyond plot mechanics. Final image of "meticulous, solitary reclamation" offers non-literal answer to the truth/lies question without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled formality matching Elias's indexer precision - "saline-treated paper and pressed kelp-vellum" shows perceptual signature. Syntax maintains scholarly rhythm even under discovery's pressure. Minor dock for occasional elevation that slightly exceeds character lexicon ("profound and sudden quiet").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive prose with strong information density - most sentences advance discovery or atmosphere. Good syntactic variety and specific detail ("crystallized salt," "petrified coral"). Some mild overwriting in emotional passages ("profound sense of peace washed over") and one instance of telling what's shown ("being tranquilly perceptive").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underwater civilization with archival detective work creates unique angle. The "conquest and erasure" revelation transforms familiar lost-civilization tropes through specific detail (coral stamp, kelp-vellum). Risk-taking in the quiet, contemplative approach to revelation pays off.</comment>
