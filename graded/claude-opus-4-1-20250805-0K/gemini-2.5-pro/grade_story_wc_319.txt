<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyel's dimensional homesickness and guardian identity create genuine internal contradiction between duty and desire, culminating in his choice to pour his longing into the pendant rather than escape. The "feral thing of sharp senses and forgotten softness" establishes compelling duality, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("deep, resonant ache"). His final shift from waiting for home to "waiting to see what the morning would bring" demonstrates earned character change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Earned Stasis through Lyel's refusal to use the portal, foreclosing his path home with clear emotional cost ("The ache in his chest remained"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the piece builds through layered imagery of frost/mist/waiting toward the crystallizing choice. The pendant serves as effective causal pressure, though the cultists' motivations remain somewhat opaque.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frozen garden with skeletal roses and weeping statues creates vivid atmosphere that mirrors Lyel's internal state. The setting constrains choice when the portal opens "in the heart of the garden," forcing Lyel to choose between his duty to this place and escape. However, the library remains more backdrop than active space, and some descriptions lean abstract ("boundaries of light were a frayed and uncertain suggestion").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pendant's temptation escalates from "cold weight" to "humming temptation" to the portal's violent opening, effectively tightening pressure. Lyel's agency drives the resolution when he actively pours his longing into the pendant to close the portal. The cost is legible in his acceptance of continued exile, though the stakes could be sharpened by showing what specifically the library protects.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of making peace with uncertainty emerges organically through Lyel's journey from passive waiting to active acceptance. The pendant as "a key to a door he desperately wanted to open, but he knew with primal certainty that the door itself was a lie" effectively develops the uncertainty motif. The final image of waiting transformed from longing to openness ("to see what the morning would bring") resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent lyrical distance with effective free indirect style ("So he would wait"). Perceptual signature shows in how Lyel experiences the garden as internalized ("the garden's frost was the ice in his own veins"). Some passages drift toward elevated register that slightly strains the feral guardian's voice ("dimensionally homesick"), and dialogue absence means we can't evaluate that aspect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the portal scene. However, abstract phrases like "interiorizing exteriors" and "boundaries of light" occasionally obscure clarity. The phrase "deep, resonant ache of being dimensionally homesick" pushes toward overwriting, and some repetition of mist/fog imagery becomes slightly redundant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of a feral library guardian torn between dimensional homesickness and duty offers fresh specificity. The twist that Lyel uses the cultists' own tool against them by flooding it with his patient longing rather than breaking it shows genuine ingenuity. The transformation of waiting from passive endurance to active openness provides non-obvious emotional complexity.</comment>
