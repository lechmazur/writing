<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "transpose life into a new key" drives consistent choices through orchestrating the exchange and ultimately leaving his post, with internal complexity shown through his "curse" of accidental prophecy. The final renunciation of his role carries visible cost through abandoning his established life and tools. Minor deduction for some abstraction in describing his "unusual occupation" without more embodied emotional stakes during the operation itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with fortune cookies accumulating toward the exchange and Elias's departure as Resonant Reconfiguration—his leaving reweights his entire orchestration role with felt cost of abandoning his life's work. The microdot specs cleverly embedded in cookie glaze provides strong causality. Slight deduction for the exchange scene being observed at distance rather than dramatized with full immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting constrains Elias's remote orchestration methods and the lantern room provides his surveillance perch for the exchange. Sensory details like "tinny echo across water" and "ghostly metronome slicing through gloom" support atmosphere. The lighthouse-as-isolation doesn't fully constrain choices beyond providing distance, missing opportunity for the setting to more actively shape tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from receiving the microdot request through orchestrating the exchange to Elias choosing to leave, with each fortune cookie narrowing the path toward the meeting. The "discordant music" needing retuning provides clear pressure. Cost becomes visible when Elias abandons his typewriter and role, though the middle orchestration lacks a complicating reversal that would heighten tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of control-from-distance versus direct participation emerges organically through Elias's orchestration methods and crystallizes when he chooses to "listen to a different song." The fortune "The keeper's watch ends when the song changes tune" resonantly reweights his entire practice. Slight deduction for the "conductor/traveler" metaphor being somewhat explicit in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through fortune-cookie aphorisms and lighthouse keeper's measured observation, with controlled psychic distance that pulls back during the exchange observation. The perceptual signature of seeing life as patterns to orchestrate is consistent. Minor filter-verb clustering ("he felt," "he saw") in middle sections dulls immediacy slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the fortune cookie lines. Information density is good with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("cryptic fortune cookie writer, a strange cottage industry") and some template phrasing in transitions ("He saw," "He felt," "He turned").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of using fortune cookies for spycraft offers a fresh angle on intelligence work, and Elias's "accidentally prophetic" gift adds originality. The microdot hidden in sugar glaze is inventive. However, the lighthouse keeper as isolated orchestrator follows somewhat familiar patterns, and the resolution of leaving for a "different song" trends toward expected transformation.</comment>
