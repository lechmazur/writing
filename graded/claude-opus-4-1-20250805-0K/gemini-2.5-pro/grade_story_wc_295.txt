<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is crystal clear—decoding the temple inscriptions as a generational burden—and his internal conflict between resignation and hope drives authentic choices. The moment of understanding ("The sorrow is not yours alone") transforms from curse to shared burden with earned emotional progression. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of "healing fractured narratives" which borders on therapy-speak, though it's grounded in his specific gift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elian transforms the burden from personal curse to shared cosmic sorrow, with visible emotional cost ("frantic energy...subsided"). The stellar dream sequence effectively bridges temple glyphs to cosmic message, and the final reweighting of the telegram from "curse" to "promise" lands with earned resonance. Minor deduction for slightly abstract handling of the "healing" mechanism.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting and stellar observation directly constrain Elian's method—he must use the grand refractor and variable stars to decode the glyphs. Vivid sensory detail ("cold copper of the eyepiece," "scent of dust and dried petals") grounds the piece. The variable stars as "glowing ideograms" effectively merge setting with solution, though the dream-space could use more concrete spatial anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear dominant stake—decoding the inscriptions to resolve generational burden—with meaningful deepening when Elian discovers the glyphs are "a lament" rather than historical record. The cost is legible in his transformation from "frantic energy" to "profound and enveloping calm" as he accepts the burden's true nature. The escalation through stellar observation to dream-state revelation coheres well under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of shared sorrow emerges organically through the telegram's phrase becoming cosmic truth—"The sorrow is not yours alone" transforms from cryptic message to universal principle. The final image of the daylily telegram shifting from "curse" to "promise" offers resonant closure without stating a moral. Strong integration of witness/chronicler role with thematic question of how we carry collective grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with distinctive perceptual signature—Elian notices through astronomical and scholarly lens ("cold copper," "grand refractor," "glowing ideograms"). Some elevated diction ("profound and enveloping calm," "fractured narratives") occasionally drifts from character voice. The dream sequence maintains coherent focalization despite the shift in consciousness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Deductions for register drift into elevated/abstract diction ("fractured narratives of his own mind," "profound and enveloping calm") and some template phrasing ("He had tried every conventional method"). The stellar description sequences achieve strong momentum, but several passages rely on abstract telling rather than concrete showing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomical observation with archaeological decryption—using variable star patterns as linguistic key is inventive. The transformation of burden from personal to cosmic through stellar "message in a bottle" offers genuine originality. The lucid dream chronicler role feels somewhat formulaic, but the specific execution through witnessing rather than guiding dreams adds distinction.</comment>
