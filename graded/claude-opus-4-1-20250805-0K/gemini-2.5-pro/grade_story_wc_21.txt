<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and grounded in his role as civil-rights archivist, with the retrocognition creating genuine internal conflict between professional duty and psychological toll. The silent negotiation through arranged debris reveals character through constrained action, and his shift from asking about conflict to asking about aftermath shows meaningful tactical evolution. Minor deduction for the antagonist figure remaining too abstract to generate full relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the debris arrangements building to the coordinate revelation as Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost is visible in Kaelen's "trembling fingers" and weeks of entrapment, with the coordinate serving as both breakthrough and commitment to deeper investigation. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon functions as more than setting—its mirror surface and light-swallowing depths constrain the parley to non-verbal communication and create psychological pressure. The beach debris becomes micro-setting that enables the central action. Deduction for the Aethelgard remaining largely ornamental beyond establishing isolation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation occurs through Kaelen's tactical shift from interrogating the past (timeline, protest) to exploring consequence (legacy, peace), which finally provokes the antagonist's first response. The cost accumulates through "searing reverie," physical toll, and weeks of isolation. Stakes could be more visceral—the "truth" remains somewhat abstract despite the coordinate payoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between preserving truth and the cost of accessing it, with the debris arrangements literalizing how we negotiate with memory and trauma. The shift from conflict-focused questions to aftermath/legacy reweights the entire investigation. The coordinate revelation offers a non-literal answer about how truth reveals itself through changed approach rather than force.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled register shifts between the brass-and-porthole formality of the Aethelgard and the visceral beach memory. The psychic landscape descriptions ("heat-haze and memory-scuff") create appropriate disorientation. Minor repetition in transition phrases ("slowly, carefully," "slow, deliberate") creates slight cadence monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("fever dream rendered in ink," "monument to defiance"). Some filter-verb clustering ("Kaelen felt," "he felt," "Kaelen opened") and mild redundancy in describing the arrangements. The coordinate revelation lands with appropriate syntactic simplicity against the earlier complexity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of negotiating with memory through physical objects in psychic space offers fresh angle on the encrypted diary trope. The silent parley using beach debris as language shows genuine ingenuity. The retrocognition-as-trap rather than gift adds complexity, though the resolution feels slightly convenient.</comment>
