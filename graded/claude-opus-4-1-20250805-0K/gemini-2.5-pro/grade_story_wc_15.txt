<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent throughout, with his "hauntingly optimistic spirit" driving concrete actions from discovering the plate through the storm crisis. His internal state remains somewhat abstract ("quiet, fervent prayer") rather than viscerally embodied, and the secondary sleepwalkers lack distinct presence despite their thematic importance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure—the labyrinth transforms from "tomb" to "cradle" through collective unconscious weaving made permanent by Kaelen's conscious intervention. The cost is visible (bleeding hands, risk of erasure) but the causality between sleepwalking discovery and conscious action could be tighter. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting actively constrains and enables choices—the canyon walls become the canvas, the dust storm threatens the work, and the "bone-white" wharfs evoke the lost maritime past. The transformation of space from "Labyrinth of Sighs" to musical, light-filled guide demonstrates setting as active participant in the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal artistic expression to communal transformation, with the dust storm providing genuine threat that forces conscious action. The cost is legible (physical bleeding, risk of total erasure) though the middle section's accumulation of threads lacks the urgency that the storm crisis delivers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of transformation through collective unconscious effort emerges organically through the sleepwalking metaphor and culminates in the resonant final line about sewing "a new shoreline from the threads of memory and hope." The reversal from tomb to cradle reweights all prior desolation imagery without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Kaelen's artistic sensibility, with controlled metaphorical language ("bone-white memories," "Labyrinth of Sighs"). Some passages drift into elevated diction that strains the POV ("profound desolation," "fervent prayer"), and dialogue absence means we miss potential for voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though several instances of overwriting appear ("hauntingly optimistic spirit persisted," "fragile dream of reverence"). The final paragraph contains some scaffold phrasing ("testament that even after") and the metaphor density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies, particularly in abstract passages about beauty and desolation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central conceit of unconscious collective art-making through sleepwalking offers genuine freshness, and the synthesis of maritime/desert imagery creates unexpected resonance. The transformation doesn't fully escape the template of "art heals community trauma" but executes it with enough specific detail (kelp-fiber rope, canyon thistle thread) to feel particular.</comment>
