<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vagrant poet's motivation to "become the translator between generations" drives consistent action through jar-collecting and the music box transformation, with embodied longing ("wistful ache") and specific gestural work. The final act of placing the seashell shows earned renunciation of restoration in favor of translation, though the internal contradiction between loss and creation could be more viscerally fought in-scene rather than philosophically resolved.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the music box receives "not restored, but transfigured" purpose through accumulated shore sounds replacing its lost song. The cost is legible in "the dense, weighted silence of a child's silenced joy" transformed into "fleeting, beautiful resonance," and the poet's "small existence justified" shows earned stasis with visible forfeiture of the original melody.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The driftwood loft and shore environment actively constrain choices—jars must capture specific coastal sounds (foghorn, sandpiper, marram grass) that become the only available materials for the box's new song. The "ribcage of driftwood" and "grime-streaked porthole" create lived-in specificity, while sensory hierarchy follows the poet's collector priorities, noticing sound textures over visual beauty.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from discovering the silent music box to the poet's deliberate choice to create rather than restore, with pressure building through the "heavier than any sound" silence that demands response. The accumulation of captured sounds represents agency through attention and curation, though the conflict remains primarily internal without external complication testing the poet's resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of giving "the lost to the found" via glass-jar translation, avoiding abstract statements about memory or art. The final image of the pearlescent seashell as "final grace note" resonantly answers whether broken things need restoration or transformation, with the "small, daily sin of letting beauty die unheard" providing earned wisdom through specific action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—the poet notices sound before sight ("dawn's earliest whistle"), filters the world through collector's priorities, and maintains lyric compression ("ribcage of driftwood," "grey silk of the morning sea"). The voice modulates from contemplative opening to urgent collection to reverent finale, with controlled rhythm that never breaks character even under the pressure of the box's silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"grey silk of the morning sea" establishes time, texture, and mood simultaneously. Some figurative density in places ("dense, weighted silence" followed by metaphorical weight) but generally strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks that track emotional beats from discovery through transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of capturing sounds in jars to give a broken music box new purpose offers fresh synthesis, with specific shore-sound symphony replacing expected mechanical repair. The "translator between generations" role and "gleaned redemption...for the small, daily sin of letting beauty die unheard" transforms the beachcomber archetype through particular artistic practice.</comment>
