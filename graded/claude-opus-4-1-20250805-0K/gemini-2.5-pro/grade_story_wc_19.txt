I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through density of silence types, sensory accumulation, and a pattern break that reweights Elian's relationship to confinement.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's claustrophobia drives credible, embodied choices with "lungs seized in any room smaller than the sky" and the porcelain doll as tangible anchor. The transformation from panic to carrying "resonant quiet" within shows earned change through specific experience, though the final insight edges toward over-articulation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the doll's repositioning from "trapped in a box" to "standing on a precipice," with felt cost in Elian's "contracted soul." The accumulative lens holds as silence types build toward transformation, though the final paragraph slightly over-explains the earned shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The xenial trellis as "intangibly tangible" crystalline framework creates vivid constraint for Elian's journey, with "solid light" and "mist...possessing emotional weight." Setting directly enables the transformative experience, from bunker suffocation to infinite openness that reshapes perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elian's battle against "contracted muscles and spirit" during ascent, with gravity inversion creating natural time pressure. The trellis silence as "vast, ancient, utterly hospitable" meaningfully deepens his quest, though more visceral cost during descent would strengthen impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars - different silence "flavors" from "gilded hush" to "crisp and clean" expansion. The doll's transformation from "captive" to "pilgrim" resonates without stating moral, though "green and living tendril" metaphor slightly strains against established imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature with "walls breathe in and out with him" and selective sensory focus. Rhythmic control during ascent sequences works well, though phrases like "nascent starlight" occasionally drift toward elevated register beyond Elian's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum with varied syntax and vivid specificity like "gray scar on green earth." However, abstract phrases ("pure potential," "barren soil of his fear") and slight redundancy in describing silence types prevent higher scoring. Opening and closing images effectively frame transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bunker-builder's child developing inverted claustrophobia feels psychologically true and non-obvious. The gravity inversion hour as escape mechanism and "xenial trellis" as welcoming anti-bunker create memorable world logic, though safety-seeking through exposure is somewhat predictable.</comment>
