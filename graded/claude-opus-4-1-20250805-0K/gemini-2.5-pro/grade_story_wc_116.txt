I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered descriptions of weight and silence rather than causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's need for silence against the accumulated weight of stories creates genuine internal tension, with embodied details like "thin and dusted with papyrus decay." The final choice to temporarily suspend duty shows clear motivation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("gravity had begun to unmoor me") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - the narrator accepts the temporary nature of peace while knowing "the peace would crumble again." The origami swan serves as a consistent mechanism for the transition. The cost is felt in the acknowledgment of inevitable return to duty. Slight deduction for the transition sequence being somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory work from "dust of ages" through "moss-cushioned flagstones" to the "liquid starlight" river. The obsidian refuge constrains choice by offering only temporary respite. The setting actively shapes the narrator's psychological state and drives the need for escape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The pressure builds effectively from general weight to the specific breaking point of Aeridor's "symphony of seawater and screams." The escalation from bearing stories to being unmade by them works under the textural lens. The temporary resolution acknowledges its own insufficiency, maintaining tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of witness versus participant emerges organically through the contrast between recording history and needing escape from it. The final image of sitting "at the edge of time" resonantly reweights the opening's burden. Strong thematic coherence without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm - "The dust of ages was the only air fit to breathe" establishes immediate atmosphere. Perceptual signature strong in selective details like "ghosts of long-dead scribes." Syntax appropriately stretches during the transition sequence to mirror the warping reality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clean, purposeful prose with strong information density. Excellent rhythm variation from long, flowing sentences to shorter declaratives like "The peace here, once a comfort, was crumbling." Minor repetition of "crumbling peace" but it serves as intentional echo. No significant loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a keeper who must escape their own archive offers fresh perspective on the burden of knowledge. The origami swan as portal mechanism and the "liquid starlight" river show imaginative specificity. The paradox of seeking silence from stories one must preserve adds conceptual depth.</comment>
