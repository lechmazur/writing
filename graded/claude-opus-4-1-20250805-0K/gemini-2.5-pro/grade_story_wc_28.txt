<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's contradictory impulses—his "warm coldness" and the price of absorbing others' pain—act effectively in scene, particularly in his gentle handling of the Retro while performing an ethically ambiguous "editing" of identity. The final renaming choice carries visible cost through the "hollow ache of a ghost's departure," though the Retro's transformation feels slightly too clean.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Kaelen's systematic erasure and rebuilding of identity, with clear cost in both the Retro's lost memories and Kaelen's accumulated burden. The causal lens holds as each action—finding the tessera, activating the stone, channeling energy, renaming—builds toward the transformation, though the world-building mechanics could be slightly clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ancient plaza with its crystalline-fractured sky and mosaic stepping stone creates a vivid post-apocalyptic setting that directly enables the story's central action through the stone's function as "circuit board." The minaret tessera and its placement constrain and enable Kaelen's choice, though some spatial choreography remains vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from witnessing suffering to active intervention to the moral weight of identity erasure, with clear cost in Kaelen's accumulating psychic burden and the Retro's complete loss of self. The tension between mercy and violation creates genuine pressure, though the resolution lacks resistance from the Retro.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of "aberrant mercy" emerges powerfully through the paradox of healing through erasure, with the lotus metaphor and the final image of Kaelen moving to the next victim creating resonant ambiguity about whether this is salvation or another form of violence. The story resists moral simplicity effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's perceptual signature—seeing suffering as "text" to be edited, feeling others' pain as a "constant, low thrum"—creates a distinct voice that maintains consistency through controlled, clinical diction even in moments of intimacy. Some filter verbs ("Kaelen believed") slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery like "the sky was a web of crystalline fractures," though occasional abstractions ("terrible and gentle gift") and slight redundancy in explaining Kaelen's role reduce density. The "arms of steel" metaphor effectively bookends the piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of memory-editing as mercy in a post-apocalyptic world offers a fresh angle on trauma and identity, with the specific mechanism of the mosaic stone as neural interface and the moral complexity of consensual erasure elevating beyond standard dystopian tropes.</comment>
