<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is consistently rooted in his duty and the weight of past failure (the parachute buckle memory), with internal conflict crystallizing in the trembling hand moment. The muscle memory sequence effectively embodies his stress response and shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor deduction for some diagnostic phrasing ("his attentively inventive nature kicking into gear") that briefly breaks embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear causal drive with the radio static clearing → pattern recognition → threat detection → calibration crisis → muscle memory solution → successful warning. Closure lands with Earned Stasis—Kael preserves trust through successful action, with the cost visible in "hollow ache" and the weight of "consequences just beginning." The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor setting with its "lattice-branch walls" and "bioluminescent mosses" creates a unique environment that constrains the action to Kael's isolated vigil. The parachute buckle functions as micro-setting that directly enables the solution. Spatial choreography is coherent, though the broader world-building remains somewhat abstract beyond the immediate workspace.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from pattern detection to the realization of colony danger to the trembling hand threatening to shatter the crystal dial. The muscle memory solution is earned through prior setup, and agency drives the resolution. Cost is visible in physical tension and the "hollow ache" aftermath, though the immediate external consequences remain implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of vigilance and trust emerges through concrete action rather than statement, with the parachute buckle serving as a physical anchor for past failure and present redemption. The final image of the oblivious sleeping world effectively reweights Kael's invisible burden. Some thematic clarity is lost in technical worldbuilding details that don't fully cohere into resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical precision appropriate to Kael's role, with effective modulation during stress (shorter, more urgent syntax during the calibration crisis). The perceptual signature focuses appropriately on patterns, technical details, and physical sensations. Minor register drift with phrases like "attentively inventive nature" that feel authorial rather than character-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose generally maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and clear action sequences. The muscle memory sequence achieves strong propulsion through concrete physical detail. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("storm of radio static had flooded the sensors, a roaring deafness") and some template phrasing in technical descriptions that could be tightened.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The midnight watcher premise offers a fresh angle through the specific world-building of the arbor observatory and the magnetic lens network. The muscle memory solution feels earned and specific to character. However, the core vigilant-protector archetype and the threat-detection plot remain somewhat familiar without deeper transformation.</comment>
