<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelan's manic laughter and obsessive ritual demonstrate clear motivation rooted in his role as Storm Herald, with his internal state embodied through physical trembling and exhaustion. The final realization that "the dawn was beginning to shape him too" provides earned character development with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("cathedral of light and shadow") and limited internal contradiction shown in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through ritual preparation, storm manipulation, and dawn's arrival to a Conceptual Repricing where Kaelan realizes he's being shaped by his own creation. The cost is legible in his exhaustion and the "unfamiliar quality" that signals unintended consequences. The prophetic patterns he accidentally creates for seers below adds causal complexity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse's crystalline apparatus and glass lantern wick function as micro-setting that directly enables Kaelan's storm-steering through total internal reflection. Setting constrains his choices through the physical properties of light manipulation and charges the final dawn image. Vivid sensory detail ("bruise of violet," "churning silver") filtered through Kaelan's particular perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through the storm's approach, Kaelan's increasingly manic manipulation, and the lighthouse shuddering "from resonance" as pressure peaks. The dominant stake—shaping reality through storm manipulation—tightens as unintended prophetic consequences emerge. Cost is visible in physical exhaustion and the realization of reciprocal transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of creation/destruction and unintended consequences emerges through concrete action rather than statement. The "celestial graffiti" accidentally becoming divine prophecy creates layered meaning. Final image of dawn shaping Kaelan offers non-literal answer to the central question of control versus being controlled by one's creations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled elevated diction ("nascent energy," "resounding purpose") appropriate to the otherworldly setting. Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("symphony of chaos") but maintains consistency. POV stable with clear perceptual signature focused on light, energy, and cosmic patterns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Some overwriting in figurative language ("cathedral of light and shadow," "symphony of chaos") and occasional abstract phrasing. Information density high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor template cadence in middle section's "He [verb]" patterns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper and cosmic storm manipulation creates non-obvious premise. The glass lantern wick's function through total internal reflection shows specific technical imagination. Transformation of keeper role into reality-shaper with unintended prophetic consequences avoids genre clichés.</comment>
