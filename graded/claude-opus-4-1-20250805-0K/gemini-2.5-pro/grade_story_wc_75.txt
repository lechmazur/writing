<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation arc from memory-keeper to active savior is well-earned through concrete details (the emerald lens revealing stress fractures, Elara's bread gift). His internal conflict between preserving memory and ensuring survival creates genuine tension. The final choice to use song rather than force demonstrates character-specific problem-solving rooted in his museum expertise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves clear Decisive Change through the waterfall's restoration, with visible cost in the community's desperate gamble on Alistair's theory. The causal chain from frozen falls → discovered fractures → remembered sonic principle → communal singing is tight. Closure lands with both physical transformation (ice to water) and cultural renewal (lost anthems saving lives).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto setting actively constrains choices through dimming phosphorescent moss and encroaching cold. The frozen waterfall functions as both physical threat and symbolic barrier. Sensory details like "rosewater dread" and the contrast between cold sterility and warm bread effectively mirror internal states without forcing symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from cultural preservation to physical survival as Alistair discovers the ice's stress fractures threaten immediate collapse. The council's resignation forces him to act alone, raising personal risk. The final collective singing represents earned agency where the community's cultural heritage becomes their literal salvation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between preservation and survival, with the bread-baking tradition and lost anthems embodying how culture sustains life. The ending offers a non-literal answer: art doesn't just commemorate the past but actively shapes survival. The emerald lens shifting from museum artifact to diagnostic tool reinforces this reweighting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent historical/curatorial perspective through phrases like "chief guide," "solemn duty," and "historically oriented mind." Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("rosewater dread," "beautiful, fragile existence") fits the cultured narrator but occasionally distances from immediacy. Dialogue, though minimal, effectively contrasts elder resignation with Alistair's urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("The colossal waterfall that shielded their sanctuary, Cataracta, had frozen solid") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("beautiful, fragile existence perpetually on the verge of shattering"). Some scaffolding appears in transitions ("Despair settled on Alistair like fine dust"). Information density is generally high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The sonic resonance solution offers a fresh angle on the ice-threat trope, grounded in Alistair's specific museum knowledge. The synthesis of cultural preservation with physical survival through communal singing feels earned rather than convenient. The bread-shaping tradition as catalyst for the solution adds particularity that resists generic template.</comment>
