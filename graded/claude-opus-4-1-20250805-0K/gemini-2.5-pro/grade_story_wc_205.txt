I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category precisely.

**Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered imagery and reflection toward a resonant reconfiguration where Kaelen's interpretation of the crystal shard reweights his understanding of the First Ones and reignites his revolutionary purpose.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation crystalizes through concrete details—his "aging fingers" on filigree, the shard as both physical object and interpretive battleground. The transformation from "defunct revolutionary" to renewed fighter emerges organically through his interaction with the temporal storm's revelations. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around his "frantic, beautiful attempt" thesis that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from Kaelen's ritual preparation through the storm's revelation to his renewed purpose. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the shard transforms from archaeological artifact to "cornerstone of a lost people's dignity"—lands with emotional cost ("sad, determined smile"). Orientation anchors effectively by line three. The "quiet war of interpretation" reframes his earlier revolutionary failure with clear stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting actively shapes the narrative—mirrors must be covered during temporal storms, creating both ritual action and metaphoric resonance. The temporal squall as "visible time" washing in "pearlescent light" provides unique worldbuilding that enables the story's central revelation. The crystal shard functions as micro-setting, constraining interpretation and enabling vision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute with Valerius establishes clear intellectual stakes that deepen when the shard reveals the First Ones' humanity. The temporal storm creates natural escalation, forcing Kaelen from passive observation to active interpretation. Cost registers in his acceptance of being called a "sentimental projection of a failed idealist"—a price he's willing to pay for truth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between "decadent tyrants" and "poets," exploring how we interpret civilizations through their artifacts. The shard becomes a lens for seeing beauty in apparent excess—"a frantic, beautiful attempt to build a dam of art against the coming tide." The final image of Kaelen holding "not just a piece of a vase, but the cornerstone of a lost people's dignity" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elegance befitting Kaelen's poetic inclination—"a sound of burnished sorrow," "the caesura in a line of forgotten verse." The prose modulates effectively during the storm sequence, shifting from methodical preparation to lyrical vision. Some elevated diction ("atomized," "caesura") fits the academic protagonist but occasionally distances the reader.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, world, or theme simultaneously. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("museum of a world") and one instance of telling that could be shown ("He was a poetically inclined man"). The "old fire, banked but not extinguished" metaphor effectively charges the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The temporal squall concept freshly reimagines time-travel/vision tropes through visible temporal currents unique to this system. The archaeological dispute over interpreting extinct civilizations offers a non-obvious angle on the "lost civilization" template. Kaelen as "defunct revolutionary" turned archaeological interpreter provides memorable specificity. The mirror-covering ritual during temporal storms creates distinctive worldbuilding.</comment>
