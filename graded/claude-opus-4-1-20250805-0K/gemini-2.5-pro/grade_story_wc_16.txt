<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is crystal clear with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (cautious exuberance vs. desperate fear), and his final choice to risk everything through the modified Proto-Aenic form carries visible cost. The "carefully reckless" trait manifests through concrete actions rather than labels. Slight deduction for Elara's limited interiority in her pivotal moment, though her guarded pain and tentative reach work adequately.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the symphony of truth transforms silence into "fragile, resonant chord of hope" with visible cost (blood-ink binding, risk of shattering). The glass ink well's transformation from "cruel joke" to "transparent promise finally fulfilled" charges the ending. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the extinct language's binding properties.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive setting constrains choice effectively—its "ambient magic" and "cathedral-quiet" atmosphere pressure Kaelen's dangerous work. The glass ink well functions as micro-setting that evolves from gift to cruel joke to fulfilled promise. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (dust motes like constellations, silvery light). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through the final entrance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are immediately clear: "restore trust...their last chance, the fragile moment before paths diverge forever." Escalation builds through the dangerous spell-casting where broken vows would "shatter the spell and likely the caster with it." The cost is legible in blood-ink, the risk of destruction, and Elara's guarded arrival ready for goodbye transformed to tentative hope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of language as binding truth—moving from silence/omission to luminous confession. The glass ink well's evolution from transparent beauty to cruel joke to fulfilled promise creates resonant subtext. The final "fragile, resonant chord" offers a non-literal answer about truth's dangerous necessity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent scholarly precision with character-specific perception ("cathedral-quiet," "constellations in moonlight"). Some register elevation in technical passages fits the arcane linguist POV. Minor deduction for slight voice flattening in the final paragraph's emotional beats and occasional filter-verb clustering ("he saw," "she saw").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for filter-verb clustering in paragraph 6 ("She saw...She saw...She saw"), some template cadence in "She saw his recklessness...She saw the glass ink well," and slight overwriting in metaphorical density during the spell sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The Proto-Aenic concept of language as binding reality offers a fresh angle on reconciliation narratives. The specific modification—adding "a personal clause of regret no Proto-Aenic scribe had ever dared attempt"—shows genuine risk-taking. The synthesis of magical linguistics with emotional confession feels earned, though the resolution trends slightly safe.</comment>
