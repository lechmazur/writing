I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This story operates under a **Causal lens** - Elias's method of tracking pulses leads him to Leo, who needs reassurance, resulting in peace. The because/therefore linkage is clear throughout.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment of Leo's emotional state ("throat working as if to swallow a stone"). The closure choice - Elias translating the grandmother's message - is earned through prior causality. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in Elias's characterization ("technician of sorrow") that borders on label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal structure with clear closure - Leo's frantic state transforms to calm through Elias's intervention, with emotional cost visible. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established early. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as Leo achieves "quiet reunion" with his grandmother's peace.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium creates atmosphere and the hearing aid functions as micro-setting that constrains Elias's method. Sensory details are selective ("moth fluttering against a windowpane"). The setting doesn't quite constrain choices enough for higher bands, but supports the hushed, liminal tone effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear escalation from detecting faint pulses to finding Leo to delivering the message. The stake - Leo's despair versus his grandmother's peace - tightens when Elias recognizes the photograph. Cost is visible in Leo's emotional transformation, though the conflict could have more resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of connection across death emerges through concrete action rather than statement. The final image of "quiet reunion" resonates without moralizing. The concept of translating love through technology and heartbeats avoids sentimentality while maintaining emotional truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with Elias, distinctive voice ("cartography of loss"). Some elevated diction occasionally drifts from naturalism ("reeling hush," "incidental heroism"). Dialogue feels natural and advances plot, though limited in quantity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("cathedral of glass and steel where echoes went to die") and occasional elevated register. Information density is good but a few phrases could be tightened ("gone eighty-seven years before she was gone entirely").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh concept of technological ghost-tracking through medical devices. The specific angle of translating heartbeats as emotional messages transforms the familiar séance trope. The combination of mundane object (hearing aid) with supernatural purpose creates memorable originality.</comment>
