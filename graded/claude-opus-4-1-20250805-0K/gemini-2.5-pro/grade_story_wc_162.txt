<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation evolves from simple return to understanding sacred thresholds, with internal conflict between fear and determination embodied through physical actions like tracing wood grain. The final choice to step through the threshold despite its finality shows earned agency with visible cost—permanent separation. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("featherly determined") that briefly disrupts embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition building to Charged Poise closure—Elian choosing the terms of his distance. The wooden grain analysis reveals spatial sheer symbols that predict the threshold's formation, creating causal linkage. Cost is felt through the "fundamental rule" vibration and acceptance of permanent separation. Slight deduction for delayed orientation anchoring of the fractured reality concept.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prism terrace with its "shards of impossible color" and weathered wooden table constrains Elian's choices—he must decode the grain patterns to navigate. The environment transforms from chaotic drift to "calm, silver void," charging the final image of chosen isolation. Strong sensory work with light, texture, and spatial disorientation serving the central conflict.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through pattern recognition: spiral discovery → logbook connection → weather system realization → threshold prediction → crossing decision. The dominant stake (understanding sacred thresholds) tightens as Elian realizes crossing means accepting permanent distance. Agency drives the progression with visible cost in the final acceptance of separation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of "necessary distances" emerges through concrete action—analyzing wood grain to find navigation codes in fractured reality. The ending reweights the opening's "butterfly effect" inheritance, showing Elian choosing his terms of separation rather than being lost. Strong integration of maze metaphor with father's teaching about reading patterns in chaos.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with phrases like "fractured hush" and "cartwheeled through airless space" creating dreamlike perception. Some register elevation ("temporal squall," "causal stability") fits the otherworldly setting but occasionally strains. Strong control of psychic distance, moving from external observation to intimate interior realization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery ("light breaking against crystal"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("featherly determined," "weather system of fractured realities") without full payoff. Minor template cadence in middle section ("He saw...He understood...He placed"). Information density high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of maze navigation with reality fractures, transforming the lost child trope through metaphysical stakes. The pilot logbook as navigation tool for dimensional weather is inventive. Risk-taking in the abstract setting and conceptual closure pays off with coherent internal logic. Bonus +0.3 for unconventional structural choice that heightens meaning.</comment>
