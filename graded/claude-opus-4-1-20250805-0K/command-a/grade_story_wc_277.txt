grade_story_wc_277.txt
I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows because/therefore linkages as Eleanor investigates based on the journalist's tip, discovers surveillance misuse, and takes action to expose it.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear but execution lacks embodied complexity. Her "orbits of regret" remain abstract labels rather than dramatized internal conflict. The shift from "solemn playfulness" to "grim determination" tells emotional states without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The closure fails to deliver on-page cost - Eleanor simply leaves "ready to share her findings" without showing the actual confrontation or its consequences. The story summarizes investigation and discovery rather than dramatizing the decisive moment. The recalibration of the telescope is symbolic gesture without causal weight or visible price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The observatory setting is well-anchored and atmospheric with "echoing halls" and "glass dome capturing faint whispers." However, the environment doesn't meaningfully constrain choices - Eleanor moves freely through corridors without spatial obstacles affecting her investigation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Stakes are declared (exposing surveillance of dissidents) but never tested through concrete opposition. Eleanor investigates without encountering resistance, guards, or systems that would create genuine escalation. The director's "evasive responses" summarize rather than dramatize conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The surveillance-versus-exploration theme emerges clearly but resolves into simple binary without complexity. The final telescope recalibration attempts symbolic resonance but lacks earned weight since we never see the surveillance's actual human cost dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature - Eleanor notices things generically ("strange markings," "cryptic notes") rather than through her specific journalistic lens. No dialogue appears despite the meeting with the director being summarized.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Pervasive summarization ("Eleanor uncovered a web of deceit," "Each discovery deepened her resolve") replaces scene work. Template phrases like "first stirrings of unease" and "grim determination" signal emotional states without specificity. The prose tells about investigation rather than showing it through concrete discovery beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The surveillance-observatory premise offers potential but executes through generic conspiracy beats. Eleanor's investigation follows predictable template without surprising turns or specific journalistic methodology that would distinguish this from any whistleblower narrative.</comment>
