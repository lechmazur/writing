<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her "creeping normality noticer" trait manifests through concrete actions, but internal contradiction remains largely conceptual rather than embodied in scene. The final moment shows earned stasis through continued gardening despite the fragility of her quest, with visible cost in the "tenuous" nature of her peace.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through discovered plaque and pattern of renewal. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elara accepts the ongoing, fragile nature of her work with visible cost: "her work was far from over." The who/where/when anchors clearly by ~60 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard functions as active setting that constrains choices—Elara must clear ivy to plant, uncover hidden plaques. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("damp earth and fading blooms," "warm with the aroma of chamomile"). The discovered plaque directly charges the final image by validating her quest.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding sacred in ordinary through guerrilla gardening—is signaled early and deepens through the discovered plaque that validates her method. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through pattern building, though the tightening remains gentle without forcing hard trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the discovered plaque "The sacred is found in the soil of the ordinary" which reweights all prior gardening actions. The bread serves as concrete symbol of persistence despite loss. The ending resists stated moral, letting the image of continued work amid fragility carry thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception reflecting Elara's gardener's eye ("tangled vines," "patch of wildflowers"). Some filter verb accumulation ("She thought," "She believed," "Elara saw") dulls immediacy in places. POV remains stable throughout with appropriate narrative modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose generally clear but contains paraphrase loops: "guerrilla gardening" concept restated multiple times; "tenuous absolution" repeated without evolution. Some elevated diction drifts from established voice ("heuristically gentle"). Information density adequate but several sentences merely restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The guerrilla gardening in palace ruins offers a specific angle, and the bread from vanished bakery creates intrigue. However, the "finding sacred in ordinary" theme and restoration-through-gardening arc follow familiar templates without significant transformation through lived detail.</comment>
