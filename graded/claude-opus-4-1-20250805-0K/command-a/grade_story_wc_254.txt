<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The poet remains abstract and passive, observing rather than choosing under pressure. No internal contradiction or embodied emotion appears; the character floats through mystical events without specific motivation or cost. The "tremor of certainty" and boundary-crossing desire are declared but never tested through concrete choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a true closure with visible cost—the poet simply walks away enriched. The transformation sequence (ice floating upward, boundaries dissolving) creates atmosphere without consequence. No path forecloses; no price is paid beyond vague "weight of experience."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium and frozen lake create vivid atmosphere, and the humming quartz colonnade becomes quasi-animate. However, the setting never constrains choice—it only provides mystical ambiance. The poet moves through rather than against the environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("transcend the ordinary," "dismantle walls that confined the soul") without concrete opposition or cost. The poem-recitation and ice-transformation lack resistance or trade-off. No meaningful tightening occurs; the poet achieves their goal without sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the boundary-dissolution metaphor and builds toward "the sacred was not in the walls we build, but in the spaces we dare to cross." However, this insight arrives through declaration rather than earned struggle. The thematic statement in paragraph 5 approaches sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with phrases like "lantern-moth hush" and "frost-kissed ground," though it tends toward purple prose. No dialogue appears. The voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond mystical observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors ("cloud-shadow poet," "lantern-moth hush") and elevated diction that obscures rather than clarifies. Template phrases like "felt a tremor of certainty ripple through them" and "the kind that clings to the skin like a second shadow" weaken precision. The prose prioritizes atmosphere over propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The mystical poet encountering a transformative space follows familiar templates without fresh inflection. The boundary-crossing metaphor and artist-as-conduit concept lack specificity. The story could occur with any creative figure in any mystical setting without alteration.</comment>
