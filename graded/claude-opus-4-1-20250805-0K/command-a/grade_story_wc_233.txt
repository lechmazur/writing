I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages as the queen's dreams lead to investigation, which reveals truth, which compels responsibility.

<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The queen's motivation is adequately established through dreams and disenchantment, with her final transformation to purpose earning causality. However, interiority remains abstract ("unease that clawed at her chest") rather than embodied, and the shadow figure's emergence lacks sufficient groundwork. The character reads more as archetype than individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Decisive Change (disenchanted to purposeful) with conceptual cost (responsibility for kingdom's actions), but the revelation feels unearned—the shadow figure appears without prior setup and delivers exposition. The causal chain from dreams to grotto to truth feels mechanically convenient rather than inevitable. Orientation is clear but the closure's weight relies on telling rather than dramatized discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setting provides functional anchoring with some vivid moments ("crystals that shimmered like captured stars"), but remains largely generic fantasy. The grotto's physical properties don't meaningfully constrain choices—the queen simply walks through. "Cobalt grotto" contradicts "ember grotto" without explanation, suggesting revision artifacts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal mystery to world-balance responsibility, but this shift occurs through exposition rather than the queen's agency. The "lacy menace" and shadows pose no concrete obstacles—she encounters no meaningful resistance or choice-points during her climb. The dominant stake (understanding dreams) resolves too easily through the shadow's explanation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of responsibility emerging from personal quest has potential, but arrives through direct statement ("Your kingdom's actions have tipped the scales") rather than earned realization. The bleeding starlight metaphor carries some resonance but the final moral—finding "a cause worth climbing mountains for"—reads as pat resolution rather than complex truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains basic consistency but lacks distinction—the prose could belong to any fantasy story. Phrases like "softly commanding" repeat mechanically without variation. The shadow figure's dialogue ("The truth is a burden") reads as generic wisdom rather than character-specific speech. No compelling perceptual signature emerges.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive structures and abstract descriptors. "Softly commanding" appears three times without purpose; "lacy menace" twice without clarity. Clichéd phrases proliferate: "weight settled upon her," "heart sank," "tremor in her chest." The filter-verb stack in paragraph 3 ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to sigh") dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story follows a well-worn fantasy template (ruler seeks mystical truth in dangerous place, discovers larger responsibility) without meaningful transformation. The bleeding starlight concept has potential but isn't developed beyond surface metaphor. No surprising turns or fresh angles distinguish this from countless similar quest narratives.</comment>
