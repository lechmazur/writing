I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ghost bride's motivation (repaying a debt) is stated rather than dramatized through embodied conflict. Her internal state relies on abstract descriptors ("mournful elation," "lovingly venomous connection") without concrete embodiment. The moment of grappling with the bead shows some interiority but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The ending achieves Charged Poise - the ghost bride stands at a threshold with the bead illuminating her path - but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. The piece establishes its accumulative pattern but the "glimmer of hope" conclusion lacks the visible price or foreclosed option needed for strong closure. The orientation anchors (greenhouse, ghost bride, bead) arrive clearly by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting provides vivid sensory detail ("air hung heavy with the scent of petrified blossoms") and creates effective contrast with the frozen world outside. The ancient tree serves as both anchor and constraint. However, the setting doesn't actively constrain choices at the closure moment - it transforms from prison to threshold conceptually but doesn't shape the final tactical decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (freedom vs. debt) is signaled early but escalation under the accumulative lens is limited - the bead glows stronger and other spirits appear, but these developments don't meaningfully tighten pressure or force trade-offs. The ghost bride's agency remains passive observation rather than decisive action that forecloses options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The debt/freedom theme emerges through the greenhouse-as-prison metaphor and collective suffering of spirits, avoiding direct moralizing. However, the thematic resolution ("glimmer of hope") arrives without earned transformation - the protagonist hasn't confronted the betrayal or made a choice that reweights the debt's meaning. The "lovingly venomous" paradox gestures toward complexity but isn't developed through concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The voice maintains gothic atmosphere through elevated diction appropriate to the ghost bride narrator, with consistent POV distance. However, several phrases feel template-like ("whisper of light," "stark contrast," "deep breath") and the perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness - any gothic narrator might notice these same details. The prose doesn't modulate with emotional intensity during the supposed awakening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "bound by a debt"/"debt she owed"/"to repay what was owed" cycle the same concept. Template phrases like "for the first time in lifetimes" and "far from over" read as scaffolding. The "lovingly venomous" and "mournful elation" oxymora feel forced rather than earned through the prose rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The ghost bride bound to a greenhouse offers a moderately fresh angle on haunting stories, and the collective debt concept adds some originality. However, the betrayal-at-the-altar backstory and the awakening-through-magical-object resolution follow familiar patterns without significant transformation. The specific detail of "petrified blossoms" shows promise but isn't developed.</comment>
