I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and pattern (moonlight, water, light/dark, the tooth object) toward a resonant moment of connection.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent ("reflect light into dark corners"), with concrete embodiment through gardening actions. The lockmaster shows credible weariness and searching. However, the instant connection lacks sufficient friction or cost, and both characters speak in overly articulate, similar registers during their meeting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the mutual recognition scene, with the tooth serving as catalyst. However, the cost remains largely abstract ("protected vulnerability") rather than concrete. The accumulative texture builds adequately but the final "kindred spirit" resolution feels unearned given the brief interaction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric opening with the luminous harbor and fire escape garden creates vivid setting. The lockmaster's tooth as micro-setting object works well. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, though the setting doesn't significantly constrain choices at the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding connection/meaning) is signaled early but remains static. No meaningful escalation occurs - the meeting unfolds without resistance or complication. The "quivering hush" atmosphere doesn't translate into actual pressure that forces difficult choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The light/dark metaphor coheres throughout, and the tooth object carries symbolic weight. However, the theme resolves too neatly into "kindred spirits finding each other" without complexity. The final paragraph states rather than embodies the thematic resolution ("had not only reflected light...").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with some evocative phrasing ("wistfully pragmatic"). However, both characters speak in identical registers - overly articulate and metaphorical. The dialogue lacks naturalistic subtext, operating instead through direct symbolic declaration ("You've found a piece of me").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clean prose with good rhythm variation and selective detail. Some effective imagery ("luminous harbor by moonlight shimmered like a mirror"). Minor issues with repetitive phrasing around "quivering hush" and occasional overwriting in dialogue, but generally strong line-level craft.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The fire escape gardener and lockmaster meeting offers a fresh angle, and the tooth as connecting object shows originality. However, the resolution into mutual understanding feels templated. The story doesn't fully commit to its lyrical mode, hedging with explicit explanation.</comment>
