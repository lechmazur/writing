<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias shows internal pull and longing throughout, but his characterization relies heavily on abstract yearning ("a longing he couldn't name") rather than embodied contradiction. The vow at closure feels more declared than earned through prior struggle—he discovers his quest rather than fighting for it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (discovering his purpose through the luminous vows) but lacks visible cost—Elias gains understanding without sacrificing anything concrete. The phrase "meteor hush" appears twice without clear meaning, creating orientation debt. Causality weakens when the hatch opens "with surprising ease" and the underwater library is inexplicably dry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sunken ship library constrains the discovery and charges the final realization effectively. Sensory details like "water pressed against the windows, but inside, it was dry" create atmospheric tension that serves the otherworldly discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (discovering purpose/meaning) emerges late and faces no real opposition—Elias simply follows lights and reads books. No meaningful tightening occurs; the skeleton key's glow and the book's revelation arrive without struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of seeking transcendent meaning through "luminous vows" emerges organically from the discovered library and connects to the sky lanterns. However, the insight arrives through passive discovery rather than earned struggle, and "the color of sound" remains an abstract concept without grounded meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance. However, elevated diction like "ethereal light" and "meteor hush" creates register drift from a lamplighter's expected lexicon, and the phrase "wandered purposefully" contradicts itself without acknowledging the paradox.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "a longing he couldn't name" echoes the earlier "couldn't quite place but felt deeply connected to." The phrase "meteor hush" appears twice without definition. Template cadence emerges in "Elias watched...Elias wandered...Elias realized...Elias left."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The underwater library discovery follows familiar portal-fantasy templates without transformation. The quest for "the color of sound" gestures at synesthetic originality but remains abstract rather than grounded in specific sensory experience.</comment>
