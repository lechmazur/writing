I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This reads as **Accumulative/Textural** - the story builds through pattern and imagery (falling stars, stillness, the lantern's glow) toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lira internalizes the lantern's purpose.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's spiritual curiosity manifests through concrete actions with the lantern, and her transformation from maintenance to "nurturing space for stillness" shows earned change. However, the internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously - her journey feels too smooth, missing the credible irrationality and struggle that would elevate characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - Lira places the lantern for the next seeker, having internalized its lesson about "flourishing stillness." The accumulative lens holds through imagery patterns. However, the cost feels more conceptual than visceral - we understand but don't feel the price of her transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The station setting constrains through its isolation and purpose (tracking falling stars), and the lantern functions as micro-setting that enables Lira's journey. Sensory detail is selective ("skeletal frame etched against the infinite void"). The space setting could pressure choices more directly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake - understanding the lantern's purpose and one's role in cosmic stillness - develops through Lira following coordinates and meditating on falling stars. However, escalation feels gentle rather than pressured; the journey lacks a meaningful tightening that would force harder choices or visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "flourishing stillness" paradox emerges organically through Lira's realization that "life thrived not in constant motion, but in moments of quiet surrender." The falling stars as sacrificing souls creates thematic resonance. The ending reweights her janitorial work as sacred without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature - Lira's observations feel generic rather than filtered through her specific consciousness. Phrases like "primal elegance" and "cosmic janitor" establish tone but the prose doesn't modulate with emotional intensity or pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prose suffers from abstract elevation ("eternal canvas," "paradoxical truth") and template phrasing ("She began to see," "She realized"). The line "flourishing stillness crystallized in her thoughts" exemplifies the tendency toward abstract summary over concrete embodiment. Information density is moderate; some passages do multiple jobs but others merely describe.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The concept of a cosmic janitor finding spiritual meaning through station maintenance offers a fresh angle. The lantern as inherited wisdom waiting for the next seeker provides modest transformation of the mentor-object trope. However, execution relies on familiar spiritual awakening beats without surprising inflection.</comment>
