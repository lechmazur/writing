<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prove "scars can sing" drives concrete action through the grafting ritual, with internal complexity shown through her burden as the arsonist's daughter becoming a firefighter. The transformation lacks full embodiment during the act itself—her emotional state shifts to "hope" and "peace" without sufficient physical manifestation of the struggle between redemption-seeking and acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's shift from seeking atonement to accepting transformation's possibility, with the grafting act serving as the decisive moment. However, the cost remains largely conceptual—while we understand she risks failure and continued rejection, the immediate stakes of this specific attempt lack concrete consequence that would elevate the closure's impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and black sand create a vivid, constraining environment that mirrors Elara's burden and shapes her grafting choice—the sterile sand becomes the very medium she must transform. The volcanic beach setting effectively functions as both obstacle and opportunity, though some descriptive passages ("kelp drifting in the lagoon's depths") serve atmosphere without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving transformation is possible despite inherited shame—remains consistent, with the grafting attempt providing one meaningful deepening as Elara shifts from fighting fires to creating life. The escalation stays primarily internal; external pressure from the villagers is referenced but not dramatized in scene, limiting the tension's visceral impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of transformation through acceptance rather than atonement emerges organically through the grafting metaphor and Elara's realization that "scars can sing." The final image of buried seeds bound by red thread resonates without explicit moralizing, though the "redemption" naming in the last line edges toward thematic declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Elara's contemplative state, with controlled rhythm in passages like "her movements as fluid as the kelp drifting in the lagoon's depths." However, some filter constructions ("she knew," "she felt") and abstract emotional declarations ("heart alight with hope") diminish immediacy during crucial beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative imagery like "migration of clouds" and "kelp-drift peace," but several instances of emotional telling ("heart hardened," "spark of unyielding compassion") and redundant constructions weaken line-level impact. The phrase "scars can sing" appears both as internal thought and narrative description, creating unnecessary repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The grafting-as-redemption metaphor offers a fresh angle on inherited guilt, with the specific detail of planting seeds in sterile volcanic sand providing concrete originality. The transformation from firefighter (destroying flames) to creator (planting life) shows thoughtful inversion, though the resolution tends toward the safely optimistic.</comment>
