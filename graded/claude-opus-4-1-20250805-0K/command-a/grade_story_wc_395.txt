<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her "brightly attentive" trait manifests in pattern recognition, but the character lacks internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. The final decision to expose the truth arrives without dramatized cost or genuine struggle—she simply decides to act without visible stakes or trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages (patch leads to numbers, numbers lead to coordinates, coordinates reveal truth), but closure lacks visible cost—Elara steps out "ready to face whatever came next" without any on-page consequence or price. The investigation progresses logically but the ending offers only declared intention rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The digital archive setting provides functional workspace and the patch serves as a concrete object, but neither constrains Elara's choices or charges the final image. Setting details like "vast digital expanse" and "old terminal" remain generic workspace descriptions without affecting tactics or creating pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract—finding truth about a decades-old disappearance—without immediate pressure on Elara beyond curiosity. The system lockout creates momentary obstacle but she bypasses it easily; no meaningful tightening occurs and the discovery of coordinates doesn't force a costly choice or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme of hidden truth and corporate cover-ups emerges through events, and the recurring numbers create pattern, but the ending resolves into simple moral clarity without complexity. Elara's decision to expose truth "no matter the cost" declares theme rather than embodying it through specific dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable and the technical investigation voice is consistent, but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices what any investigator would notice. The narrative voice maintains competent clarity but doesn't modulate with emotional intensity or reflect character-specific bias in what's perceived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Prose is functional with clear sequencing but suffers from generic phrasing ("vast digital expanse," "heart raced," "mind racing") and repetitive structures. The paraphrase loop "Elara's heart raced. The numbers weren't just a pattern; they were a message" restates without adding pressure, and filter verbs ("she knew," "she realized") distance key revelations.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The corporate archivist investigating space mission cover-up combines familiar elements without transformation—the execution reads as competent assembly of mystery tropes. The recurring numbers and hidden coordinates don't offer fresh angle on either corporate conspiracy or missing persons narratives.</comment>
