<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to "photosynthesize pain into beauty" is clear and consistent, but interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("shyly unstoppable," "centuries of longing") rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The final transformation lacks earned causality—we see her complete her work but never witness the specific struggle or cost that would justify such monumental change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the poet's gradual transformation through creation, but closure lacks visible cost—she simply "smiled, her heart full" without showing what was sacrificed or foreclosed. The "blossom armistice" concept remains abstract metaphor rather than dramatized change. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell functions as both setting and co-character, its "whispering chambers" and "ancient walls" actively responding to the poet's work. Sensory detail focuses primarily on sound and touch, appropriately filtered through an insomniac's perception. The shell constrains choice by providing sanctuary but never presents obstacles or resources that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming pain into beauty—is signaled early but never faces concrete opposition or test. No meaningful tightening occurs; the poet simply continues her work across time without obstacles, reversals, or trade-offs. The "shift" when the shell hums in response lacks causal trigger or cost—it's assertion without earned escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "blossom armistice" theme of reconciling pain and beauty emerges through the poet's creative process, but resolution arrives through declaration ("she understood the true meaning") rather than dramatized discovery. The final image of stepping out with stars winking gestures toward resonance but doesn't reweight prior material with specificity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with lyrical, contemplative tone appropriate to an insomniac poet, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("gargantuan," "photosynthesize") without clear POV justification. The "half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" method is voice-appropriate but mechanically vague. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prose suffers from abstract declaration loops ("centuries of longing" appears twice verbatim) and reliance on telling over concrete action. Multiple passages restate the same concept without advancement: "transform pain into beauty" cycles through various phrasings. The template progression "Hours turned into days, and days into weeks" followed by "As the weeks turned into months" creates mechanical time passage without specific incident.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept of an artist transforming pain through creation inside a shell sanctuary offers a poetic premise, but execution relies on familiar artistic-transformation templates without specific innovation. The "galaxy postcard" as talisman and the shell as responsive architecture provide some texture, but the emotional arc follows predictable stations without surprising inflection.</comment>
