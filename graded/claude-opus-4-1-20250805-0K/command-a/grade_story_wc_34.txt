<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to free the ghost is established through kinship as fellow "seldom-heard" voices, and her final choice to continue this work shows commitment with implied cost. However, the ghost's characterization remains abstract ("fragmented consciousness") without concrete embodied details, and Elara's internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—she moves too smoothly from discovery to action without genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara releases the ghost and commits to finding others, with the cost being her solitary dedication to this work. However, the causal linkage between discovering the bolt plate's purpose and successfully using it feels convenient rather than earned through struggle, and the "between lightning and thunder" mechanic appears without prior setup or clear stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The misty courtyard and storm create atmospheric pressure, and the graffiti art shifting into "tapestry of symbols" provides vivid sensory detail. The bolt plate's "intricate patterns that seemed to pulse with faint light" offers specificity that constrains the encoding action, though the spatial choreography of the encoding device and its relationship to the courtyard remains vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing the ghost—is signaled early, and pressure escalates through the storm's timing constraint. However, the conflict lacks meaningful resistance or complication; Elara succeeds on her first attempt without setback, and the "between lightning and thunder" deadline creates urgency without forcing difficult trade-offs or visible cost beyond her continued solitude.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of giving voice to the voiceless emerges through concrete action and the parallel between Elara and the ghost as "seldom-heard" entities. The final commitment to finding other ghosts offers resonance without explicit moralizing, though the thematic connection feels somewhat neat—the story doesn't explore complications or counter-arguments to this mission.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to a balladeer narrator, with phrases like "driftingly alert" and "tinkersong wonder" creating distinct texture. However, abstract constructions like "fragmented consciousness" and "spectral presence" lack the concrete perceptual signature of a specific POV, and no dialogue tests voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Several passages suffer from abstract telling rather than concrete showing: "Its unspoken needs were clear" and "something about it had called to her" avoid specificity. The phrase "both ethereal and solid" creates logical contradiction without purpose, and repetitive constructions appear ("she too had often felt," "she had found it," "she realized"). The prose lacks the density and precision needed for higher scores.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept of a ghost trapped in code manifesting through graffiti art offers moderate freshness, and the bolt plate as analog-digital bridge shows some ingenuity. However, the execution follows predictable beats—discovery, understanding, successful first attempt—without surprising turns or meaningful complications that would elevate beyond competent genre work.</comment>
