<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clara's motivation to resurrect stories is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like "quill hovering" and "heart quickening." The final choice to pursue the mysterious broadcast shows agency, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral. Internal contradiction appears briefly when excitement battles caution, but could deepen further.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the radio's intensifying glow and the emergence of the pirate broadcast. Closure achieves Charged Poise as Clara stands with "quiet determination," having received the fragment that will guide her work—though the cost (abandoning her copying work) could be more explicit. Who/where/when anchors clearly by paragraph two.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "ember alcove in mist" creates atmospheric pressure through sensory detail ("scent of aged paper and damp wood," "mist clung to the windows like a veil"). The radio's spreading luminescence constrains Clara's choice by drawing her from her work. Setting actively participates in the transformation as "the room, once dim and still, now felt alive."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resurrecting lost stories—intensifies when the pirate broadcast offers a concrete path forward, forcing Clara to choose between her methodical copying and this mysterious opportunity. The radio's increasing glow and the song's responsive tempo create escalating pressure. Cost appears as Clara abandons her original work, though this trade-off could carry more weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete image of teaching "dust to tell stories" and the radio as conduit for lost narratives. The final image of the threshold room offers resonant answer to the story famine without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the song's elusive nature and Clara's physical response to the radio's warmth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with selective perception ("fleeting shadows," "static hiss") that reflects Clara's scholarly focus. The prose modulates effectively from methodical precision to quickened excitement as the broadcast emerges. No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice remains coherent throughout with purposeful rhythm shifts under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The radio, an old relic with a secretly luminous face, had been her companion since the story famine"). Some elevated diction in peak moments ("tantalize the mind") slightly strains the register. Minor repetition of "lost" and "stories" but generally clean with varied sentence structures. The template phrase "Clara felt a surge of excitement" drops immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of a "story famine" and teaching "dust to tell stories" offers fresh angle on creative resurrection. The pirate broadcast as mysterious story-source transforms the expected mentor-student dynamic. Specific details like "orchestra copyist" and "shortwave radio" ground the fantastical premise in concrete particulars.</comment>
