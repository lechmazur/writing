<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation shifts from survival to discovery, but the transformation lacks embodied conflict—her fear dissolves too easily when she touches the vial. The "lonesome splendor" of solitude reads as told rather than felt through specific physical or emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (Maya's shift from survival to discovery) but lacks visible cost—she simply "feels peace" without dramatized trade-offs. The cave-in setup promises physical stakes that evaporate mid-story without causal resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The underwater temple setting effectively constrains initial choices through the cave-in and limited oxygen. The crystal chamber and shifting walls create atmospheric pressure, though the magical resolution undermines the physical constraints established early.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (survival via limited oxygen) is abandoned halfway through without resolution, replaced by discovery stakes that never face concrete opposition. The vial solves problems without creating new complications or forcing meaningful trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of preserving ephemeral moments emerges through the crystal chamber imagery but relies heavily on abstract statements ("harness the ephemeral," "fleeting moments that made life precious"). The final paragraph explicitly moralizes about "beauty that lay just beyond the edge of everyday life" rather than letting the image resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Maya notices everything with equal clarity despite supposed oxygen deprivation. Prose defaults to telling ("Maya felt," "Maya realized") rather than filtering through her marine biologist expertise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades ("Maya reached," "Maya realized," "Maya discovered," "Maya felt"), creating mechanical rhythm. Abstract phrases like "lonesome splendor," "gathered hush," and "harness the ephemeral" repeat without gaining specificity or embodied meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The underwater temple discovery follows familiar archaeological adventure templates without transformation through specific detail. The vial-as-key-to-ancient-secrets and the marine biologist protagonist are stock elements executed without fresh inflection.</comment>
