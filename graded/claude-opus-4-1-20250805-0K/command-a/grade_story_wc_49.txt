<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore sacred practices is clear and consistent, driving her actions throughout. However, the transformation from searching to success lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle—she succeeds through determination alone without meaningful cost or sacrifice visible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with golden light and song fragments building toward restoration. The closure shows Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara gains the orbs/stories, but the cost remains abstract—"work far from over" doesn't demonstrate visible price for what she's gained.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The verdant arbor and glowing workshop create vivid atmosphere, with the vine tendril serving as micro-setting that constrains choice and enables the final transformation. Sensory details of golden light, rustling leaves, and sparkling dew effectively mirror the magical awakening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established—restore practices to heal village—but escalation is minimal. The songs simply arrive when Elara hums at the right moment without meaningful resistance or complication; success feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of reconnecting with lost wisdom emerges through concrete images of golden threads and glowing orbs rather than statement. The final image of Elara as guide with "golden light" resonates, though the resolution feels too neat without acknowledging what maintaining these practices will cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical quality with controlled rhythm and selective perception focused on light and organic imagery. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("verdant arbor," "gathering hush") but generally serve the whimsical tone without overwhelming clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structure, though several phrases feel overwrought ("the soft glow of the harvest moon still lingering"). Minor redundancy in describing the golden light's effects across multiple paragraphs without advancing meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept of songs restoring sacred practices offers a competent fantasy framework but relies on familiar tropes without transformation. The resolution—magical object responds to protagonist's determination—follows predictable patterns without surprising inflection or genuine risk.</comment>
