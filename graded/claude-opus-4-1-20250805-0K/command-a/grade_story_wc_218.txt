<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear (leaving a legacy before death) but his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "brazen calm" reads as a static trait rather than tension between competing desires. His final renunciation/acceptance carries some cost but feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward Elias's peaceful death, but the closure lacks visible cost—he simply "closed his eyes" without dramatized price for his transformation work. The orientation is clear early but the ending reads as Earned Stasis without the required "foreclosed path" being made legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The temple orchard with living stone pillars creates atmosphere and the copper wire constrains Elias's method of reshaping branches. However, the setting doesn't meaningfully pressure his choices—he works undisturbed for months without environmental obstacles affecting his mission.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The six-month terminal diagnosis establishes stakes but never tightens—Elias proceeds systematically without setbacks, urgency shifts, or moments where his limited time forces trade-offs. No meaningful reversal or deepening occurs; the orchard simply transforms as planned without cost or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The interspecies respect theme emerges through Elias's work but remains abstract—"unity" and "harmony" are asserted rather than dramatized through specific conflicts. The final entry moralizes directly ("May it remind them of the respect we owe") rather than letting the image carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some distinct touches like "the wire seemed to hum with energy." However, the narrative voice tends toward explanatory summary ("The orchard was their masterpiece") rather than staying grounded in Elias's immediate perceptions under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "determined to foster interspecies respect"/"to foster respect between humans and the natural world"/"interspecies respect he sought to foster." Template phrasing like "Days turned into weeks" and abstract declarations ("The orchard was alive, not just in its leaves and roots, but in its spirit") replace specific imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dying caretaker discovering architectural secrets follows a familiar template without transformation. The "living stone pillars" and botanical diary feel ornamental rather than essential to the story's logic. No surprising turn or fresh angle emerges from the premise.</comment>
