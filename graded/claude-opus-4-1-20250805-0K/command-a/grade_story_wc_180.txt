<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to mend "fractures in people's lives" while carrying her own cracks establishes clear internal contradiction, but the transformation from despair to hope lacks embodied struggle—she simply "realizes" and "whispers" her way to renewal. The daughter's departure and breach remain abstract backstory without dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the ribbon's transformation into the glowing tree, but causality weakens when forgotten objects conveniently solve problems (key unlocks scroll, petals cause bloom) without established logic. The breach of contract backstory consumes ~25% without anchoring present choices beyond metaphorical reflection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard fusion creates vivid atmosphere ("sunlight filtered through shattered stained glass," "branches heavy with fruit"), and spatial movement tracks clearly from stairs to rafters to altar. However, the setting enables discovery (hidden compartment) rather than constraining choices—Elara could perform her realizations anywhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of "bridging generational wisdom" remains abstract throughout, with no concrete opposition or tightening pressure—Elara faces only her own thoughts. The "breach of contract" exists purely as backstory without present-scene consequence or cost that would force trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The deciduous vow metaphor of renewal through "necessary shedding" emerges organically from the orchard setting and Elara's realization about letting go. However, the thematic resolution arrives through explicit reflection ("Perhaps the breach wasn't a failure but a necessary shedding") rather than dramatized discovery, and the final wisdom feels unearned by scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency with phrases like "quartz in her irises catching the light" and selective details like "rusted key" and "dried petals." However, interiority relies on abstract summary ("questioning her methods and motives") rather than concrete perception, and no dialogue tests voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of clarity ("branches swaying in encouragement") but suffers from paraphrase loops ("mending wasn't about restoring what was lost but about creating something new from the pieces" restates the deciduous metaphor). Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("for the first time in months, she felt hope") and abstract summaries dominate over concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The quartz-eye mender concept offers initial intrigue, but execution defaults to generic healing-through-acceptance arc without exploiting the specific properties of quartz vision. The cathedral-orchard setting provides atmosphere but doesn't generate unique story logic—this tale of renewal through loss could occur anywhere.</comment>
