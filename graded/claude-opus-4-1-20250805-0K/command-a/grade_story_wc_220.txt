<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his past as a bloodhound, with the transition from dormant curiosity to "embers catching flame" effectively showing internal change. The final choice to translate the riddle's meaning into connection shows earned wisdom, though the emotional cost could be more visceral. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("testament to his desire for solitude") that tells rather than embodies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the leaf's transformation and Elias's understanding that "the wasteland wasn't just a place of loss; it was a place of connection." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and the phonograph's revelations build toward this reweighting. Cost is primarily conceptual rather than visceral, visible in the shift from isolation to connection. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established clearly within the first paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The scrapyard setting actively constrains choices—Elias's cabin location reflects his desire for solitude, the phonograph factory provides the crucial device, and the "wild hush" atmosphere charges the revelation scene. Sensory details like "metallic tang of corrosion" and "acrid scent of burning wire" are POV-filtered through Elias's bloodhound past. The transformed leaf's glow casting "long shadows across the cracked wasteland" effectively uses setting to charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the riddle's meaning—escalates from curiosity to active investigation to transformative understanding. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as details accumulate (leaf's warmth, shifting symbols, resonant hum) toward the revelation. The tightening occurs when "distance being translated into closeness" becomes the key insight, though the cost remains more conceptual than dramatically felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "translating distance into closeness" without explicit moralizing. The leaf's transformation from preserved relic to glowing beacon effectively reweights its meaning. The final image of walking together with the leaf's glow "casting long shadows" offers a non-literal answer to isolation versus connection, though the thematic resonance could deepen with more embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent post-apocalyptic register with effective modulation ("bled into the horizon," "skeletal ruin"). Elias's perceptual signature as former bloodhound shapes what he notices (scents, patterns, secrets). Dialogue feels natural with appropriate subtext—Lira's nervousness and deference, Elias's gruff curiosity. Minor deduction for occasional elevation that strains POV lexicon ("intuitively descriptive").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose generally clear with good momentum, though some sentences carry abstract scaffolding ("testament to his desire for solitude"). Information density varies—strong in sensory passages, thinner in transitional moments. The phonograph sequence effectively varies rhythm to match discovery. Deduction for filter-heavy construction in places ("Elias realized," "he understood") and occasional overwriting ("amber and ash").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The phonograph-as-decoder concept offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic discovery narratives. The preserved leaf in wax as a key is specific and memorable. However, the resolution's abstraction ("translate distance into closeness") and the relatively safe thematic landing prevent higher scoring. The transformation could push further into unexpected territory.</comment>
