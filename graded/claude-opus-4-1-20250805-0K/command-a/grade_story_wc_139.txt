<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is clear and her honesty-as-burden trait drives meaningful choices, particularly in confronting her father about asylum. The father remains somewhat stock as "notorious con artist" without deeper specificity. The final choice to seek honest solutions shows earned change with visible relational cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the ink pot's mysterious energy accumulates toward Clara's crystallized stance against running. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Clara articulates a new path forward with her father's tentative agreement marking relational cost. The "mathematics of a fair trade" resolves conceptually as balance between honesty and survival, though the mechanism for "staying honestly" remains vague.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room creates appropriate uncanny atmosphere with formaldehyde, cold marble, and flickering lights. The ink pot functions as micro-setting that enables Clara's mental shift. However, the setting doesn't constrain choices beyond mood—the conversation could occur anywhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding honest survival vs. continuing schemes) develops through Clara's growing resistance, culminating in her confrontation. The ink pot moment provides textural deepening but lacks clear causal pressure. Cost appears as the father's "controlled frustration" melting to acceptance, though the practical implications remain abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ink pot's "liquefying rigid thinking" as both literal and metaphoric—breaking down the father's schemes and Clara's passive acceptance. The "mathematics of fair trade" reframes from external balance to internal integrity. The ending resonates without moralizing, though "balance, honesty, and courage" edges toward explicit summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close-third POV through Clara with appropriate child perspective ("a flaw in an otherwise perfect scheme"). Some register elevation occurs ("deathly vitality," "fragile equation") that stretches beyond a child's likely articulation. Dialogue differentiates father's sharp calculation from Clara's trembling firmness effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose flows clearly with varied sentence structures and selective detail. Several abstraction loops weaken momentum: "It was unsettling but not unwelcome" followed by the simile restates rather than advances; "the mathematics of a fair trade" appears three times without evolution. The ending accumulates abstract nouns ("balance, honesty, and the courage") that dilute the concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The funeral home setting for a con artist's deal offers mild freshness, and the ink pot as catalyst for mental transformation provides modest originality. However, the father-daughter dynamic and "con artist seeks redemption through child's honesty" follows familiar templates. The resolution toward vague "honest" solutions lacks specific innovation.</comment>
