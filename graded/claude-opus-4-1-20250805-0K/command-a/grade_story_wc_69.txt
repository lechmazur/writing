<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but relies on abstract declarations ("to braid diverse voices into harmony") rather than embodied contradiction. The phrase "expectantly resigned" appears as a label without constraining action. Her final understanding arrives through summary rather than earned struggle, though the rosette provides some concrete anchor for her attachment to vanishing arts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through repeated choir sessions, but closure lacks visible cost—applause arrives without showing what was sacrificed or transformed. The shift from "mausoleum of silence" to "living cathedral" reads as assertion rather than earned change. Orientation is clear but the stakes remain abstract ("unlearning hatred") without concrete dramatization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The velvet library with autumn light and stained glass creates atmosphere, but setting doesn't constrain choices—the library could be any quiet space. The rosette's "intricate carvings catching the light" provides visual detail without function. Spatial choreography during the performance remains vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on preserving vanishing arts but never face concrete opposition—the "encroaching noise of indifference" remains abstract. The choir grows "not in numbers, but in depth" without showing what this costs or how it changes tactics. No meaningful tightening occurs; success arrives through unexplained audience conversion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of harmony-through-subtraction emerges but resolution feels unearned—"the true victory lay not in the applause, but in the silence they had replaced" tells rather than demonstrates. The rosette transforms from "symbol of loss" to "beacon of hope" through declaration. Final paragraph explicitly states the moral rather than letting it emerge from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent distance and the prose has moments of texture ("traveled stillness," "velvet library"). However, abstract phrasing dominates ("sanctuary of knowledge," "hollow silence of unlearning hatred") and Elara's interiority relies on conceptual summary rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prose suffers from abstract inflation ("mausoleum of silence," "living cathedral of sound") and paraphrase loops—"vanishing arts" concept repeats without evolution. Template phrasing appears ("As they sang, Elara noticed," "Weeks passed, and," "One evening, as"). Some effective rhythm in quieter moments but peak beats rely on assertion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The concept of preserving arts through subtraction rather than addition offers a fresh angle, but execution remains generic—any endangered tradition could substitute. The rosette as separated instrument part has specificity but doesn't generate unique story logic. Risk-averse middle ground avoids both failure and triumph.</comment>
