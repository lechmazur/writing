<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to redeem his family name drives consistent choices through discovery and renunciation. Internal conflict between chasing silence versus truth crystallizes believably, though the epiphany ("he wanted to be heard") arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient embodied struggle. The final choice to pursue truth over hush shows earned cost through his father's cautionary journal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens coheres through lighthouse imagery and the lattice's recurring presence, building to Elias's stance crystallization. The journal discovery provides causal linkage between father's legacy and son's choice. However, the closure's cost remains more declared than felt—"knowing he was no longer the son of the boy who cried wolf" tells rather than shows transformation's price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison's physical details—weathered stone, narrow door's scuffs, copperlight chamber—effectively constrain movement and discovery. The lattice functions as micro-setting that grounds Elias during descent and charges the final hovering image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through the spiral descent and return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal redemption to understanding the guards' disappearance as "offerings" to the lighthouse's power. The journal revelation narrows Elias's options between repeating his father's path or forging new ground. Yet the final hovering and decision to tell truth lacks immediate dramatic pressure—the urgency of "before they found the bodies" dissipates without consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus silence emerges through the lighthouse's hush power and Elias's inherited burden. The lattice motif accumulates meaning from confessional relic to sustaining impossibilities to final defiance tool. However, the ending's explicit declaration "he was Elias, the boy who chased truth" provides too neat a moral rather than letting the image resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled diction ("copperlight repose," "lattice sustained impossibilities"). Perceptual signature shows in how Elias notices architectural details and interprets the lighthouse as resisting. Some elevated phrasing ("thread this labyrinth with his own story") occasionally drifts from embodied perception into writerly abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("The air grew colder, heavier, as if the lighthouse itself resisted his descent") but suffers from repetitive abstract declarations. Template phrasing appears in emotional summaries: "he wanted to be heard, to tell his story without fear of disbelief." The final paragraph contains multiple telling statements that should be dramatized: "in that truth, he found his freedom."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of inheriting the "boy who cried wolf" legacy offers fresh angle on truth-telling consequences across generations. The lighthouse as repository of silencing power provides original world-building. The hovering ability and lattice's impossibility-sustaining properties feel somewhat ornamental rather than essential to the core conflict.</comment>
