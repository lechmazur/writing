<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora's telepathic gift creates genuine tension through the choice to intervene, though the motivation feels somewhat abstract. Elara's desperation is stated but not fully embodied through concrete sensory detail. The earned change—Liora finding purpose through connection—lands but lacks the visceral cost needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Liora's shift from passive observer to active guardian, with clear causal linkage between warning and outcome. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The accumulative lens holds but the stakes feel distant through summary ("Weeks later") rather than immediate dramatization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The underwater garden setting provides atmospheric grounding and the ampoule's fragility creates a concrete constraint. However, spatial choreography remains vague—we don't feel water pressure, murk density, or Elara's physical navigation. The setting exists more as backdrop than active pressure on choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—saving the village—escalates through Liora's intervention creating doubt in Elara's certainty. The structural weakness of the ampoule provides concrete pressure. Yet the resolution occurs off-page through summary, diluting the cost that should charge the closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of "nuance versus certainty" emerges organically through Liora's intervention and Elara's forced reconsideration. The foxglove's dual nature reinforces this complexity. However, the final paragraph veers toward explicit moralizing ("a quiet reminder that even the most unyielding truths...") rather than trusting the dramatized events.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistency but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Liora's telepathic perspective could be more alien and specific. Elara's single line of dialogue feels functional rather than revealing character. The narrative voice tends toward elevated abstraction ("tapestry of whispers") without grounding in the POV's unique way of noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "forgotten underwater city"/"forgotten city remained forgotten," "living statue"/"statue was no ordinary monument." Template cadence appears in "Liora sensed...Liora learned...Liora's words." The prose reaches for poetry but creates density issues with abstract figurative language that doesn't advance pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The telepathic statue concept offers modest freshness, and the foxglove's medicinal duality provides thematic resonance. However, the execution relies on familiar beats—mysterious artifact, village in peril, wisdom figure intervention—without sufficient transformation through specific lived detail.</comment>
