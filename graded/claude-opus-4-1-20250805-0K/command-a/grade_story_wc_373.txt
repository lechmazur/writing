<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and rooted in family loyalty, with concrete embodied details like clutching the watch fob. The confrontation scene shows her using wit over violence, revealing character under pressure. However, internal conflict remains largely abstract ("comforting unease") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the resolution lacks a visible personal cost beyond maintaining the status quo.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain (theft → investigation → confrontation) with Lila as active agent. Closure lands as Earned Stasis - she maintains the "truce of hush" through words rather than violence. However, the cost remains conceptual ("trust, once broken, could never be fully repaired") without visible price on the page, and the fortune-teller beat creates false momentum without payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pirate market setting is vivid with sensory details ("salt and decay," "labyrinth of shadows") that establish atmosphere. The pier location and dawn timing anchor the scene. However, the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain choices - Lila could have this same confrontation anywhere - limiting its integration with plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (exposing betrayal/maintaining truce) is signaled early and tested through confrontation. Lila's verbal maneuvering shows agency, and tension builds adequately. However, escalation lacks meaningful tightening - the thieves simply back down without forcing a trade-off, and no visible price is paid for maintaining the fragile peace.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of trust and silence emerges organically through the "truce of hush" concept and Lila's navigation of betrayal. The watch fob carries symbolic weight as both taunt and weapon. The ending offers resonance about trust's fragility, though it edges toward explicit statement ("The sound of trust breaking was a quiet one") rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with noir-inflected prose appropriate to the underworld setting. Lila's perceptual signature shows through selective attention to silence and lies. However, dialogue lacks distinctness between characters, and the narrative occasionally drifts into explanatory mode ("It was no longer just a family heirloom; it was a weapon").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and atmospheric description. Some effective moments like "learning to read the silences between words." However, several instances of telling over showing ("her focus unyielding"), abstract descriptors ("comforting unease"), and the final paragraph's explicit thematic summary reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The moonshine runner's daughter navigating criminal underworld offers genre competence with some fresh angles (sound of trust breaking). The resolution through words over violence provides a non-obvious approach. However, the confrontation resolves too easily without genuine struggle, and familiar noir elements aren't sufficiently transformed.</comment>
