<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, but the internal shift from despair to hope lacks sufficient dramatized struggle. The "confidently uncertain" trait gets label treatment rather than embodied contradiction. The final realization ("purpose wasn't something to be discovered in facts") arrives through summary rather than earned through specific on-page choices that cost him something tangible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's shift from insulating with facts to embracing hope, but the cost remains abstract ("the echo valley longing in his heart would always be there"). The accumulative/textural lens holds but lacks a decisive tightening—Elias's transformation occurs through internal declaration rather than a dramatized choice with visible stakes. No concrete action or renunciation makes the before/after legible with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The quarry setting mirrors Elias's internal void effectively ("stretched like a scar on the earth"), and sensory details like "dust and diesel" ground the scene. The speaker grille scrap functions as micro-setting that bridges past and future. However, the environment doesn't constrain choices—Elias could have this realization anywhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding purpose after loss) is clear but remains static throughout. No meaningful escalation occurs—Elias moves from feeling empty to deciding to fill that emptiness, but without any tightening pressure or narrowing options. The internal shift happens through reflection rather than through choices that test his commitment or force trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of purpose after loss emerges through the speaker grille scrap and quarry imagery, avoiding direct moralizing until the final paragraph. The "echo valley longing" and "applause" motifs create resonance. However, the ending's explicit articulation ("purpose wasn't something to be discovered in facts") explains rather than embodies the theme through image or action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on tactile details ("fingers tracing the frayed edges"). POV remains stable in third-limited. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("bridge the gap between who he was and who he wanted to be") that feels more authorial than character-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing about purpose and meaning ("What was his purpose now?" "Wrest meaning from the chaos, purpose from the silence"). Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum, particularly in the middle section. The final paragraph contains explicit theme statements that replace scene pressure. Some strong sensory moments ("smoke-filled venues," "dust and diesel") can't offset the overall abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ex-roadie turned appraiser premise offers specificity, but execution relies on familiar templates of loss and rediscovery. The quarry office trailer setting provides some freshness. However, the transformation from facts to hope follows predictable beats without surprising turns or non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
