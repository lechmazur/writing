<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to save her dying language is clear and drives her actions, but internal conflict remains largely abstract ("trembling hands") rather than embodied contradiction. The curse's physical cost on her copper veins provides some embodied stakes, yet her emotional progression feels too smooth—she moves from uncertainty to accomplishment without genuine ambiguity or irrationality under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Causal lens with Lira entering the tunnel, deciphering echoes, and shattering the diamond to save her language—a Decisive Change with visible cost (her drained strength, faded veins). However, the resolution feels mechanically convenient: she hears the pattern, sings, the diamond responds, and succeeds despite the curse, without meaningful complication or tactical adjustment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bone towers and echo canyon create vivid atmosphere with luminescent moss and pulsing tunnel walls that effectively mirror the story's themes. The flawed diamond's interaction with the environment (drawing energy from the tunnel) demonstrates setting-as-constraint. Yet spatial choreography within the tunnel remains vague—we lose specific positioning during the crucial singing sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (saving the dying language) is established early, and the curse creates nominal cost through physical drainage. However, escalation is minimal—Lira faces no meaningful reversal or tactical adjustment, simply progressing from entering to hearing to singing to succeeding. The flock of birds feels ornamental rather than complicating her choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of preserving cultural heritage through sacrifice emerges through events, with the diamond's curse literalizing the cost of preservation. However, the story resolves too tidily—Lira succeeds completely, the language is "safe now," without ambiguity or lingering questions. The final image of her as "guardian, keeper of echoes" states rather than resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some effective moments ("copper veins...glinting like polished metal"). However, voice lacks distinctiveness—Lira's perceptual signature doesn't emerge beyond generic storyteller observations. The narration occasionally drifts into explanatory mode ("She was no longer just a storyteller; she was a conduit") rather than maintaining experiential immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive constructions ("She was no longer just a storyteller" appears twice verbatim) and abstract telling ("filled with a sense of accomplishment"). The template progression (setup-challenge-triumph) creates predictable rhythm. Several metaphors feel forced ("towers of bone that rose like jagged teeth") without earning their figurative weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the copper-veined storyteller and texture-to-sound translation offer some originality, the core arc (hero enters dangerous place, faces mystical challenge, sacrifices to save culture) follows fantasy template without meaningful transformation. The curse functions generically—it drains energy but doesn't complicate her methods or force unexpected choices.</comment>
