<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Characters remain archetypal rather than individuated, with Elara functioning more as plot device than character. The collective effort mechanics work but lack internal contradiction or genuine struggle. Kael's transition from restlessness to action feels automatic rather than conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with the nebula's return and Elara's fade-out, achieving basic Decisive Change with visible transformation. However, the causal chain feels predetermined—discovery of message leads directly to restoration without meaningful complication. Cost remains abstract (Elara's fade feels ceremonial rather than sacrificial).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating arches creates vivid atmosphere, and the butterfly garden setting constrains action effectively. Details like "bronze masterpiece shaped like a butterfly in flight" and the nebula's "waterfall of stars" provide specificity. However, the setting doesn't actively pressure choices—it's more backdrop than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (restore the nebula) but escalation is minimal—the team encounters no significant obstacles between deciding to act and succeeding. The bell restoration proceeds smoothly through each character's convenient specialty. No reversal or tightening narrows options; success feels guaranteed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of collective healing emerges cleanly but lacks complexity—strangers become family and work together to restore hope. The butterfly metamorphosis symbolism is overly neat. Final paragraph states theme explicitly ("strangers who had become family stood united"), violating the show-don't-tell principle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Omniscient narration maintains distance without distinctive texture, reading like consensus prose rather than a singular perspective. Dialogue is absent despite multiple characters interacting. POV lacks perceptual signature—descriptions could belong to any observer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Prose relies heavily on stock fantasy imagery ("ancient guardians," "fragile blossom," "tapestry") and purple constructions ("brambled hope," "nebula of respite"). Template cadence appears in character introductions. The writing is competent but lacks propulsion, with several passages that could be cut without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The setup combines familiar fantasy elements (ghost messenger, magical bell, collective quest) without transformation. The resolution follows expected patterns—each character contributes their exact needed skill. "Brambled hope" as metaphor feels forced rather than organic to this world.</comment>
