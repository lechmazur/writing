I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This reads as Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered exploration and discovery, with Eli's transformation of the terminal serving as a density increase that reweights the space from desolation to possibility.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by his desire to "puzzle out new equations for hope." His functionally creative approach manifests through concrete actions - manipulating vents, mirrors, and speakers. However, the internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; his progression feels too smooth without genuine struggle or meaningful mistakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as Eli's explorations build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the terminal transforms from "desolation to something resembling vitality." The closure lands with conceptual cost - the terminal "would never see passengers again" - creating a bittersweet achievement. The sextant piece effectively guides the accumulation pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal functions as more than setting - it becomes Eli's canvas for transformation. Strong sensory details like "dim light filtering through broken windows" and "cracked tiles" establish atmosphere. The terminal's "maze of intentions frozen in time" constrains and enables Eli's choices, with its remnant systems becoming tools for resurrection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake - finding hope in ruins - is signaled early and deepens as Eli discovers the terminal's latent potential. The escalation from passive observation to active manipulation ("opened vents...propped up mirrors...rigged old speakers") shows agency. However, the lack of meaningful opposition or complications prevents higher scoring; his experiments succeed too easily.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of resurrection and reinvention emerges organically through Eli's actions rather than declaration. The sextant as "a key to something larger" and the terminal as "a story, a testament to human ambition" create resonance without moralizing. The final image of Eli carrying forward "the maze of intentions...within him" offers a non-literal answer to finding hope.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited with appropriate psychic distance. Phrases like "functionally creative mind began to turn" and "stoic wonder" establish Eli's engineering perspective. However, some passages drift toward elevated register ("ghosts of travelers past," "labyrinth...frozen in time") that slightly exceeds the intern character's natural lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose shows competent clarity but suffers from occasional overwriting. Mixed metaphors appear ("maze of intentions," "flows of air, light, and even memory"). Template phrasing emerges in "That's when the idea struck him" and "By the time dawn broke." The final paragraph's abstract assertions about "equations for hope" and "maze of intentions...within him" lack concrete grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The concept of resurrecting an abandoned space through engineering creativity offers a fresh angle. The synthesis of explorer's navigation tool with modern engineering creates an interesting temporal bridge. However, the transformation feels somewhat predictable - the lonely creative finding meaning in ruins follows familiar patterns without surprising inflection.</comment>
