I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor for a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density builds through layered imagery (butterflies, greenhouse, ribbon, stone) toward Elara's conceptual repricing of grief as migration rather than static monument.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal journey from seeking to "carve grief's essence into stone" to understanding it as "migration through time and memory" shows genuine evolution with embodied craft details. The spectral mentorship works as internal pressure, though some passages drift toward therapeutic insight ("collective grief was not something to be solved but something to be carried") rather than lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Conceptual Repricing closure lands cleanly—grief transforms from static shape to migration, with the ribbon pattern etched into marble as concrete manifestation. The accumulative structure coheres through butterfly/ribbon/migration imagery building toward this realization, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse with its "glass panes humming with centuries" creates atmospheric pressure, and the butterfly migration provides visual rhythm. The ribbon's frayed threads and marble's texture ground the abstract meditation on grief, though the setting could constrain choices more actively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The central tension—how to capture loss in finite marble—develops through accumulative pressure rather than causal escalation. The resolution emerges from pattern recognition (ribbon resembling butterfly flight) leading to conceptual shift, appropriate for the textural lens but lacking a moment where options genuinely narrow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme emerges elegantly through the central metaphor of grief as migration versus monument, with the ribbon pattern becoming the bridge between concepts. Tomas's quoted wisdom about grief as "space to be honored" pays off in the final carving, though "collective grief" edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The meditative voice suits the gravestone carver's contemplative work, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "thundering calm" and "fleeting symphony." However, register occasionally elevates beyond the character's established voice ("spectral mentorship," "interconnectedness") and the POV modesty wavers when asserting Tomas's presence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of resonance ("thundering calm," "glass panes humming") but suffers from abstract scaffolding ("collective grief that had shaped," "profound impact," "renewed purpose"). Several paraphrase loops appear (grief passages repeat similar insights), and filter constructions ("she felt," "she realized") accumulate in the resolution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse-as-meditation-space and spectral mentorship offer modest freshness, but the core insight about grief relies on familiar metaphors (journey, interconnected threads). The butterfly migration as visual counterpoint to stone carving provides the story's most original synthesis.</comment>
