<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to ground spirits is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied actions (fingers tracing, pressing needle into knots). The connection to her broken mask/family loss provides adequate internal stakes. However, the emotional progression feels too smooth—she moves from "heart heavy but at ease" without sufficient internal contradiction or struggle in the pivotal unraveling moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through whispers building to "flood of whispers" at the climax. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara finds peace through honoring spirits' stories, with visible cost in her trembling hands and heavy heart. The orientation is clear (sanctuary, before dawn, mask restorer), and the accumulation of silence/whispers creates coherent pressure toward the ending realization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary with shifting starlight and stained glass creates atmospheric pressure that mirrors internal states. The net functions as micro-setting, its physical resistance ("as if the net itself were alive") constraining Elara's choices. The sanctuary's transformation from "accumulated silence" to "lighter" after the spirits' release charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on grounding spirits while confronting personal loss. The net's increasing resistance ("particularly stubborn knot refused to yield") provides one meaningful tightening that forces Elara's plea for strength. However, the resolution comes too easily after this moment—the flood of whispers and subsequent peace lack sufficient struggle or visible trade-off beyond trembling hands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the parallel between mending objects and mending self, with the net's unraveling revealing interconnected stories of loss. The final realization about "honoring their stories" reweights prior restoration work without explicit moralizing. However, the insight "in mending the broken, she was also mending herself" edges toward stated theme rather than purely emergent meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with selective perception (focusing on tactile details of nets, light through glass). The prose rhythm effectively slows during contemplative moments and quickens at the whisper flood. Some filter-verb clusters ("She felt their sorrow," "she understood") slightly dull immediacy during the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves atmospheric density with varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm shifts. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "accumulated silence"/"silence accumulate" repetition, and the final paragraph's "mending the broken/mending herself" restatement. The "heart heavy but at ease" oxymoron works, but "lucid unrest" feels forced as descriptor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mask restorer working on fishermen's nets offers a fresh angle on the restoration trope, with the spirit-communication element adding originality. However, the healing-through-helping-others arc follows familiar patterns without sufficient transformation. The specific detail of knots-as-stories provides some distinction, but the emotional trajectory remains safely conventional.</comment>
