I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This story operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens. The narrative builds through layered discoveries (boot print, journal, memories) that accumulate meaning rather than following strict causal chains. The closure arrives through Elias accepting the stranger's borrowed memories—a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the opening's significance.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias demonstrates clear motivation through "softly persistent habits" and his methodical investigation, with embodied details like fingers trembling when discovering the journal. The character's acceptance of borrowed memories at closure shows earned transformation, though internal contradictions could be sharper during the discovery sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias accepts the stranger's memories as his own responsibility, with felt cost ("strange sense of peace"). The accumulative structure coheres through the journal discovery and memory fragments, though the cost could be more visceral at the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The opal dock and mist create atmospheric pressure that shapes Elias's investigation, with sensory details like "mist clung to him like a second skin." The lighthouse beam's sweep provides spatial coherence and symbolic weight that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulative discoveries—boot print, journal, memories—that reweight Elias's understanding. The pressure coheres under the textural lens as density increases, though the tightening could more forcefully narrow options at the climactic realization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of "borrowed memories" and isolation, with the boutonnière serving as a concrete bridge between past and present. The final image of carrying another's story forward offers resonant answer to questions of memory and connection without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with selective perception ("weathered planks glistening faintly") and character-specific observation patterns. Some filter phrases ("Elias felt," "he thought he saw") could be trimmed for immediacy, but rhythmic control supports the contemplative tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and atmospheric density, though occasional redundancies appear ("mist seemed thicker, the silence heavier"). The phrase "softly persistent" effectively recurs without feeling forced, and sentence variety maintains momentum through the investigation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of inherited memories that aren't one's own offers fresh angle on memory and identity. The specific synthesis of lighthouse keeper, borrowed memories, and the Edelweiss token creates memorable particularity that resists generic treatment.</comment>
