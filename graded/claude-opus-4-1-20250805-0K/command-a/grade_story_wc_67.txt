<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her ritual action carries weight, but internal contradiction remains mostly told rather than embodied. The piece establishes her weariness and reverence but doesn't show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her final reflection on impermanence feels earned through the specific act of ash-scattering, though the emotional progression relies more on assertion than embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's completed ritual, with the ash-scattering crystallizing grief into acceptance. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through layered imagery (mask, chair, ash). Cost is visible in "the weight of her task pressed heavily" and the final acknowledgment of universal impermanence, though the emotional price could be more viscerally felt rather than philosophically stated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The gallery setting with its "high ceilings and walls adorned with fleeting shadows" creates atmosphere, and the porcelain mask serves as a constraining object that mirrors theme. However, spatial choreography remains vague—Elara's movements from entrance to mask to "center of the gallery" lack concrete anchoring. The rocking chair and mask function more as symbolic stations than lived-in environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring the dead through ritual completion—is signaled early and maintains coherence. Escalation occurs through accumulative pressure as Elara moves from observation to action, with the chair's slowing creating temporal urgency. The cost manifests in accepting impermanence, though the conflict lacks a decisive tightening moment that would foreclose options or force trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the porcelain mask metaphor and ash-scattering ritual, avoiding explicit moralizing until the final paragraph. The mask's "jagged edges catching the light in a way that felt both beautiful and painful" effectively embodies the fragility theme. The ending's meditation on impermanence resonates, though phrases like "mirage of safety" and "somber marvel" feel prompted rather than discovered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency with elevated, contemplative diction appropriate to Elara's role. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—descriptions feel literary-generic rather than filtered through Elara's specific consciousness. No dialogue appears, and while the meditative register suits the ritual nature, it creates syntactic monotony with similar sentence structures throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from overwriting in figurative density—nearly every sentence contains metaphorical language without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She had always been one to weave truth carefully," "She had always been drawn to things that were broken"). The final two paragraphs contain significant paraphrase loops, restating the impermanence theme without added pressure or detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The ash-scattering ritual offers a specific angle on grief work, and the porcelain mask metaphor provides fresh imagery for fragility. However, the meditation on impermanence follows familiar philosophical territory without transformation. The piece commits to its contemplative mode but doesn't risk bold structural or perspectival choices that would distinguish it from other literary grief narratives.</comment>
