I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered discoveries and symbolic resonance rather than strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—understanding the physics of letting go—with concrete embodiment through her methodical exploration and physical handling of artifacts. The internal arc from hollow discovery-seeker to someone who practices release is earned through accumulated particulars. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("sophisticated melancholy") and the slightly convenient epiphany timing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's final act of placing the globe down demonstrates learned release with visible cost (leaving behind the object she's been studying). The accumulative structure coheres well through the snow globe's evolving meaning from mystery to memento to practice object. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay regarding the underwater setting's mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sunken library setting effectively constrains choices (waterlogged materials, limited access paths) and the snow globe's intact state amid decay creates meaningful contrast. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from cross-legged position through deeper exploration. Deduction for underutilized underwater physics that could have added more pressure to movement and time constraints.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding letting go—deepens through the layered discoveries (journal, map, letter) that reweight the snow globe's significance. The final choice to leave the globe demonstrates agency with clear cost. Limited deduction for relatively low external pressure; the conflict remains primarily internal/philosophical without urgent physical stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the accumulation of unfinished narratives and the snow globe's transformation from preserved object to symbol of release. The final insight about "letting the snow fall where it may" resonates without moralizing. The sophistication lies in how impermanence is explored through both decay and preservation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with distinctive perceptual signature (archaeological attention to detail, analytical processing). Strong voice modulation in contemplative passages. Deduction for occasional register elevation ("labyrinth of unfinished narratives") that slightly exceeds the established voice and some filter verb accumulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structuring. Information density is solid with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("sophisticated melancholy," "quietly analytic"), some elevated diction in peak moments, and minor redundancy in thematic statements about letting go.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of death personification with marine archaeology creates an original frame. The snow globe as a teaching object for release rather than preservation subverts expectations. The connection between Earhart's "hollow" discovery and this deeper exploration shows thoughtful layering.</comment>
