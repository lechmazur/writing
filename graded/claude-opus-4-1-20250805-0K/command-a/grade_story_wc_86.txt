<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Characters operate with clear professional motivations and the negotiation tension is palpable, but internal complexity remains thin—Elara's empathy reads as stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The drawer pull gesture provides grounding but doesn't reveal character-specific blind spots or flaws that complicate the resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece reaches Earned Stasis as Kael agrees to "begin anew" while withholding full forgiveness, creating a crystallized moment of provisional agreement with visible diplomatic cost. However, the accumulative lens lacks density increase—the negotiation proceeds through linear dialogue without pattern breaks or cadence shifts that would reweight the stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The storm-worn parapet in mist creates atmospheric pressure and the drawer pull functions as micro-setting that grounds Elara's philosophy. Setting subtly guides the negotiation's tone but doesn't constrain choices or provide resources that alter tactics—the environment remains backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (untethering nations from mistrust) and Kael's resistance provides tension, but escalation remains flat—the negotiation doesn't tighten or deepen beyond Elara's initial proposal. The resolution arrives through philosophical persuasion rather than pressure that narrows options or forces trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The recycling mistakes theme emerges organically through the drawer pull's history and Elara's negotiation philosophy, avoiding explicit moralizing. The ending's "first step" on a path to forgiveness offers resonance, though the thematic work relies heavily on dialogue articulation rather than embodied scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prose maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—both Elara and Kael speak in similar registers of articulate formality. The narrative voice tends toward elevated diction ("furrowed hush," "fractured kingdoms") that creates atmosphere but doesn't reflect a specific focalizer's biased way of noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Opening establishes strong atmosphere but prose tends toward overwriting—"furrowed hush of a storm-worn windblown parapet" stacks modifiers, and metaphorical language appears dense without pattern-teaching ("chains of mistrust," "neutral territory"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("begin anew" concept restated multiple times) but don't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The moon-phase negotiation method and drawer pull metaphor offer modest freshness, but the core diplomatic scenario follows familiar patterns. The transformation of breakdown into wisdom through neutral ground doesn't substantially transform the negotiation trope through specific lived detail.</comment>
