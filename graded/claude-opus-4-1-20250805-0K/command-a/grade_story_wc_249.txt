<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied details (drumming fingers, perching on stone) and contradictory impulses between escape and connection. The final choice to become "a weaver of dreams" feels earned through her lagoon revelation, though the epiphany arrives somewhat quickly. Internal conflict between isolation and connection plays out concretely through her interaction with the water.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the lagoon revelation serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration that reframes the entangled memories from curse to bridge. Cost appears in "auroral sorrow" and the acceptance of shared grief, though it could be more visceral. The orientation anchors (garden, Elara, experimental treatment) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and auric lagoon create a vivid sensory environment that constrains choice—Elara must approach the water to understand her memories. The lagoon's responsive humming that matches her drumming rhythm effectively makes the setting active in the transformation. Specific details like "liquid memory" and leaves that "whispered secrets" establish atmosphere without overwhelming the narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding and accepting the entangled memories—deepens when the lagoon reveals their true nature as connection rather than confusion. The shift from seeing memories as "labyrinth" to "bridge" represents meaningful escalation under the textural lens. Cost appears in accepting "collective grief," though the transformation happens quickly without sustained resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of isolation versus connection emerges through concrete images—the lagoon as bridge, memories as "threads in a frayed tapestry." The final reframing from "guinea pig" to "weaver of dreams" offers resonant closure without stating a moral. The shared dream concept evolves from erasure to creation, though some philosophical passages ("The shared dream wasn't about erasing pain") edge toward direct statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent lyrical distance with controlled rhythm, particularly in passages like "the hush of the universe inhaling." Some register elevation appears in peak moments ("auroral sorrow that clung to her") but stays within bounds. The perceptual signature—focusing on vibration, resonance, harmony—suits the sound garden setting and Elara's musical sensibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variety and selective imagery, though some passages lean purple ("otherworldly hue," "liquid memory"). The recurring musical/sonic metaphors cohere well. Minor redundancy appears in the memory descriptions (labyrinth/entangled/threads), and some abstract phrasing ("breathing life into a shared dream") could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of memory manipulation with harmonic resonance offers a fresh angle on the experimental subject trope. The specific detail of drumming as grounding mechanism and the lagoon responding to rhythm shows originality. The transformation from victim to creator provides a non-obvious resolution, though the memory-sharing concept itself is somewhat familiar.</comment>
