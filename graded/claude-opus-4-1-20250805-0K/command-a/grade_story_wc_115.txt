<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her need to resolve her father's disappearance, with some embodied tension ("heart quickened"), but internal conflict remains largely abstract rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The shift from skepticism to belief happens too smoothly without genuine struggle—she simply "couldn't shake the feeling" rather than wrestling with opposing forces. The final choice to turn the valve lacks visible cost beyond generic screams and shadows.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain (discovery leads to valve, valve releases souls) with a Decisive Change closure, but the cost remains generic—"screams turned to sighs" without specific price paid by Mara. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established early and the drive lens reads as Causal throughout. However, the resolution feels mechanically convenient: insert valve, turn wheel, problem solved without meaningful sacrifice or foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tunnel setting provides vivid sensory detail ("damp earth and rusted metal," "cold stone walls") and the valve wheel serves as a concrete constraint on the final choice. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from entrance to central chamber. However, the factory machinery description remains generic ("gears hung mid-turn, belts draped like cobwebs") without specific details that make this particular ghost shift unique.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding truth about father/ghost shift) is signaled early and escalates from exploration to confrontation, but the tightening lacks genuine cost—shadows that "lunged" create momentary tension without lasting consequence. The resolution through turning the valve feels too easy; no trade-off or sacrifice required beyond brief hesitation. Agency exists but the opposition dissolves without extracting meaningful price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of confronting dismissed truths emerges through events rather than statement, and the father's "swallowed truth" metaphor carries through to closure. However, the resolution is too tidy—skepticism simply gives way to belief without exploring the complexity of that transformation. The ending offers surface resonance but lacks the non-literal depth that would reweight prior material; the ghost shift is exactly what father claimed, validated without complication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and some distinct texture ("drowsy alertness that had settled over her sharpened"). Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful. However, the prose occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("spectral figures," "haunting reality") that doesn't fully match Mara's practical explorer characterization, and dialogue is absent where it might have added texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and good momentum through action beats. Information density is adequate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. Minor overwriting appears in metaphorical density ("weight of a swallowed truth" mixed with ghost imagery) and some template phrasing ("She stood, the valve wheel clutched in her hand, and followed the noise"). The final paragraph contains slight redundancy between "weight lift" and "sense of peace."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The ghost shift factory concept offers a workable premise but executes it through familiar beats—skeptic validates supernatural parent, industrial ghosts need release via mechanical solution. The story doesn't transform these tropes through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The valve-as-key resolution feels mechanically convenient rather than earned through character-specific insight or cost.</comment>
