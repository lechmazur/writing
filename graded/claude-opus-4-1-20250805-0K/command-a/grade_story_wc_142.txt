<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and her role as "culture shock absorber" drives consistent action, but internal complexity remains surface-level with stock phrases like "pride and exhaustion." The foundation stone discovery creates a motivated turn, yet emotional states read as declared rather than embodied—"hopeful desperation" is named but not felt through concrete perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with graffiti discoveries building toward communal resistance, but closure lacks visible cost—the festival succeeds without sacrifice or trade-off. The final paragraph declares victory through abstract promises ("beacon of possibility") rather than dramatizing a decisive change with felt consequences on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The raft city setting is vivid in patches ("patchwork of barges," "amber and gold") and the foundation stone chip functions as micro-setting, but spatial choreography remains vague—we never understand the city's layout or how Lira navigates between discoveries. The perpetual carnival atmosphere is declared but not lived through sensory detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on privatization threatening community identity, signaled early through gentrification warnings, but escalation plateaus—Vorin's opposition amounts to dismissive words without concrete obstruction. The festival resolution arrives without meaningful cost; community unity manifests without anyone sacrificing or choosing between competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Theme of community versus commodification emerges through the graffiti trail and dual allegiance concept, but resolution defaults to simplistic binary—collective good triumphs without examining what individuals sacrifice. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes about "reclaiming narrative" rather than letting the festival image carry thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance, but voice lacks distinction—Lira's perceptual signature could belong to any protagonist. Vorin's single line of dialogue ("Progress is coming...") reads as villain stock rather than revealing character through subtext or specific diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from abstraction loops and template phrasing: "whispered in promises," "pull of something hidden, something vital," "beacon of possibility." High-pressure beats summarize rather than dramatize—the entire festival climax compresses into telling ("grand display," "rallying cry") without scene-level specificity or embodied action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The gentrification-threatens-community premise follows predictable beats without transformation—evil developer, plucky resistance, triumphant festival. Graffiti as encoded history offers slight freshness but execution remains generic; the story could transpose to any threatened community with minimal changes.</comment>
