<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's guilt and internal conflict are well-established through concrete details like her misinterpretation tragedy, though the emotional progression toward resolution feels somewhat accelerated. The choice to write as the lost child shows genuine agency with visible cost, earning the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the letters leading to emotional release. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when silence replaces dissonance, with cost visible in Elara's years of suffering, though the final transformation could use sharper dramatization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The laboratory setting with glass chambers and humming machines creates atmosphere, and the amber insect provides a constraining metaphor for Elara's trapped state. However, the setting could more actively pressure choices rather than serving primarily as backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of silencing guilt escalates through discovery of the letters, which forces Elara to confront her past directly. The cost is legible in her years of torment, though the resolution through letter-writing feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the amber insect metaphor and the concept of translation/mistranslation, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of "meteor hush" replacing dissonance offers resonant closure without stating the lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with lyrical descriptions like "constellation tattooist" and "laboratory of lost sounds," though some passages drift toward abstract poeticism. The perceptual signature of someone haunted by sound is distinctive but occasionally overwrought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose shows moments of beauty ("time folds in on itself") but suffers from abstract phrasing ("the dissonance of old guilt") and some repetitive constructions around the firmware's whispers. Several sentences could be tightened without loss of meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of constellation tattooing with translating cries creates an original premise, and the laboratory of lost sounds offers a fresh setting. The resolution through writing as the dead child shows creative risk-taking, though some elements feel slightly forced together.</comment>
