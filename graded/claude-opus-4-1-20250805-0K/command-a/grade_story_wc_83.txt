<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Zara's trauma motivation is clear and her attraction to the crystals feels genuine, but her internal transformation relies heavily on abstract realizations ("unfiltered awakening," "hunter of light") rather than embodied struggle. The final shift from survivor to seeker occurs through exposition rather than a dramatized choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Zara's gradual awakening through crystal study, but the closure lacks visible cost—her transformation is declared ("she was no longer just a survivor—she was a seeker") without showing what she sacrifices or risks. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established adequately by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting with its electromagnetic fields and geode crystals creates a distinctive atmosphere that mirrors Zara's internal state. The crystals effectively function as micro-setting, constraining her choices and charging the final image when she holds one "up to the light."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While the story establishes Zara's stake (finding meaning after trauma), there's no meaningful escalation or tightening—she studies crystals, has an insight, and feels purposeful without facing opposition or making a choice that forecloses options. The perturbation theory concept remains abstract rather than generating concrete pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The crystal-as-resilience metaphor and the observatory suspended between destruction/creation work thematically, but the ending delivers its wisdom through direct statement ("she was no longer just a survivor—she was a seeker") rather than earned resonance. The theme of transformation under pressure is present but relies on telling rather than dramatized particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent close-third POV with some evocative phrases ("air thick with the scent of ash and char"), but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Zara notices things generically rather than through a trauma-survivor's specific lens. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("hunt for patterns, the meaning" / "hunt was not just for answers"), and abstract phrases like "intangibly tangible energy" and "unfiltered awakening" lack concrete grounding. The final paragraph contains explicit theme statements that replace scene pressure, though some vivid images ("dress...hung in tatters") land effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The drone strike wedding survivor studying crystals in an observatory offers an unusual combination, but the execution relies on familiar trauma-to-enlightenment templates without sufficient transformation through specific detail. The perturbation theory angle remains underdeveloped as metaphor rather than dramatized method.</comment>
