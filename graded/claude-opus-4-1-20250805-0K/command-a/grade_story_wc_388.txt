<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a truth-seeker is consistent and drives her choices, particularly in the climactic sealing sequence where she chooses containment over destruction at personal cost. However, the emotional embodiment remains somewhat abstract ("exhausted," "deep breath") and the internal conflict between preserving life and containing danger could be more viscerally felt through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously rather than sequential reasoning.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves closure through Elara's decisive action to reinforce the seal, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where the orchard's survival comes at the cost of constant vigilance and the return of dust storms. The causal chain from investigation to discovery to containment holds, though the sudden appearance of the shadow-mass entity feels slightly underestablished given its centrality to the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The wasteland-orchard contrast is vivid and the stillpoint's bubble effect creates genuine atmosphere, with the diamond's warmth and the ground's trembling providing tactile grounding. The setting constrains choice when Elara must decide between destroying or containing the stillpoint, though more specific sensory details during the confrontation sequence would strengthen the visceral reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving life while containing danger—escalates from investigation through discovery to the physical confrontation with the shadow mass, with Elara's chant-scream showing genuine pressure. The cost is visible in the return of dust storms and the shift from comfortable lies to "fragile balance," though the shadow entity's emergence could use more grounded build-up.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of excavating truth versus comfortable lies emerges through action, particularly in the revelation that the life-giving stillpoint is also a prison, avoiding direct moralizing. The final image of Elara with the now-inert diamond effectively reweights the opening's promise of answers, though the "comfortable lies" concept could be more specifically dramatized rather than stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency with selective details like "boots sinking into ashen soil" and technical observations fitting a debunker's perspective. However, register occasionally drifts toward elevated literary phrasing ("testament to human ingenuity and desperation") that doesn't fully align with Elara's practical mindset, and some filter constructions ("she realized," "told her") dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Several template constructions weaken momentum: "Elara's investigation led her," "As she approached," "That night, Elara camped" create predictable rhythms. The climactic sequence suffers from abstract phrasing ("formless mass," "final surge of will") where specific imagery would heighten tension, and multiple instances of telling rather than showing ("Her sharply observant mind," "Exhausted") reduce visceral impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The stillpoint-as-prison twist offers a fresh angle on the post-apocalyptic sanctuary trope, and the flawed diamond as both key and seal provides specificity. However, the execution relies on familiar wasteland imagery and the shadow-entity confrontation feels generic, missing opportunities for more distinctive world-building details that would elevate beyond competent genre work.</comment>
