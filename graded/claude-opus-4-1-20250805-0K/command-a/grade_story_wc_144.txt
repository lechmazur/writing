<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's blindness creates genuine constraint that shapes her methods, and her motivation to restore trust reads clear. However, the internal experience lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she operates with steady calm throughout without visible internal friction. The traveler exists only as a frantic/relieved pair of reactions, missing opportunity for relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with sensory details building toward the drone's restoration, but lacks a true closure with visible cost—the repair succeeds without sacrifice or trade-off. The final meditation on "every broken thing held the promise of renewal" reads as thematic summary rather than earned reconfiguration. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The water features that cast light patterns Elara uses to navigate create a unique sensory architecture that directly enables her repair method. The depot atmosphere with mist, oil, iron effectively grounds the industrial setting. The environment actively constrains and enables her choices through the interplay of sound, light refraction, and tactile navigation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the drone to rebuild trust—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or complication. The repair proceeds methodically without setback, reversal, or meaningful choice between competing goods. The ship's anchor lifting provides atmospheric parallel but doesn't create pressure on Elara's task.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme of healing broken things through patience emerges from the repair process and Elara's methods, though the final paragraph's explicit statements ("every broken thing held the promise of renewal") undercut subtlety. The blindness-as-different-sight motif works but lacks complexity—no counter-reading challenges the simple equation of disability with special insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent close-third POV with controlled psychic distance and no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature—experiencing the world through sound, vibration, and refracted light—is distinctive. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("chains groaning under the weight of destiny") beyond what the focalization supports.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("She + verb" dominates) and unnecessary abstraction ("negotiation between her and the machine, a silent dialogue"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "her blind eyes, clouded yet keen" followed by redundant explanation of her non-visual methods. The "anchor" metaphor in the final paragraph strains when applied to Elara's shop as both sanctuary and force.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The blind artisan who "sees" through water and light refraction offers a fresh sensory approach to the repair narrative. However, the execution relies on familiar disability-as-superpower tropes without complicating them. The parallel between ship's maiden voyage and drone restoration provides structural interest but doesn't transform the expected arc.</comment>
