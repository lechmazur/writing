<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eluan's motivation as a lost soul collector is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like tears of uncertain origin and the "modestly fearless" trait manifesting in his gentle approach to spirits. The internal conflict between forcing laughter versus finding genuine joy creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("luminous ache still glowing") in the final beat that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the gorge transforms from "a place of endings" to one "humming with beginnings" with visible cost (Eluan's tears, the empty vial). The harp's transformation from warped to tuned crystallizes the change. Slight deduction for the cost being more implied than viscerally felt in the final moments.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Echo Gorge functions as more than backdrop—its walls reverberate with both cries and laughter, the scree constrains movement, and the canyon's narrowing mouth shapes Eluan's path forward. The warped harp as micro-setting directly enables the spirit collection. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors ("pallid rose," "tender glow") that could be more specific to this particular gorge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation as more spirits join the lattice of light, building from single confessions to "hundreds passing through." The dominant stake—healing lost souls through genuine laughter—faces meaningful pressure when the crocodile tooth "rattled, reminding Eluan of the price of half-measures." Cost is visible in Eluan's tears and the transformation of both harp and gorge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between forced and genuine laughter, with the harp's distortion serving as metaphor for how healing requires accepting imperfection. The ending reweights the opening's "pallid rose" dawn into "real sun" without stating a moral. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract "luminous ache" that verges on telling rather than showing the thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with selective perception focused on sound and light ("sideways" chord, "frost flowers" of whispers). The prose modulates effectively between description and action. Deduction for occasional register elevation that strays from Eluan's perspective ("spectral confessions," "diaphragm of light") and some filter-verb clustering in the middle section.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the harp both reveals spirits and serves as instrument of healing). Good syntactic variety and rhythm control. Deductions for figurative density that occasionally obscures clarity ("cramped prism," "mud-dreams") and some abstract phrasing ("luminous ache") that could be more concrete, particularly near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of healing through laughter rather than force offers a fresh angle on ghost stories, with specific details like the unfinished comedian's punchline creating memorable moments. The warped harp as conduit transforms a standard supernatural tool. Minor deduction for some familiar elements (crystal vial, mystical tooth) that aren't fully transformed beyond their archetypal uses.</comment>
