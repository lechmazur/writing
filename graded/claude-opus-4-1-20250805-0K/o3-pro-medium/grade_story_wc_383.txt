I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor for a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's characterization as a "charmed skeptic" who must "tear open and name the gears inside" drives authentic internal conflict through embodied details like "pulse vibrated with ghostly resolve" and the "chill in her chest." Her choice to accept her brother's memory rather than leave it quarantined demonstrates earned change with visible emotional cost. The contradiction between her archival instinct and "unexamined yearning" creates genuine tension resolved through specific action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's transformation from isolating grief to carrying memory forward, with clear cost in accepting "every syllable of her brother's farewell." The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the closure where "Independence...was not the absence of voices but the freedom to choose how their chorus shapes the march ahead." The brother's sacrifice provides causal backbone while the garden's mystical logic remains internally consistent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The velvet garden's sensory specificity—"petals drank indigo dusk as if savoring forbidden wine"—creates atmosphere while the setting actively constrains choice through "hedges that glimmered like constellations" sealing behind Mara. The marble pedestal becomes a focal point for action, and environmental details like "soft lights that circled her ankles like guardian comets" participate in the resolution. Some descriptions edge toward purple prose but remain purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Mara's personal quest to the revelation of her brother's sacrifice, with the shell's restoration serving as tangible proof of transformation. The choice between leaving memory quarantined or carrying it forward creates genuine tension with clear trade-offs. Cost manifests in accepting painful truth: "Sorrow surged, but her motivation burned brighter."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of isolation versus independence, culminating in the insight that independence means "freedom to choose how their chorus shapes the march ahead." The garden as archive metaphor enriches without overwhelming, and the brother's sacrifice adds moral complexity. The final image of "resonance structure still writing its score" offers non-literal resolution to the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, though occasionally strains toward elevated diction ("tragically radiant against the creeping gloom"). POV remains stable with appropriate narrative modesty—Mara discovers rather than knows. Some filter constructions ("She realized," "She felt") could be stronger, but perceptual signature stays distinct through selective attention to mystical details.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong imagery and varied syntax but suffers from occasional overwriting—"velvet garden," "velvet-lined pocket" creates unintentional echo. Some metaphors strain ("resonance structures, vibrating between the shell, the marble, and her marrow"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, though abstract constructions like "isolation...was merely raw ore" slow momentum in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a garden that quarantines memories offers fresh angle on grief narrative, with specific execution through the brother's sacrifice adding originality. The shell as conduit and the garden's archival nature avoid cliché. While memory-exploration is familiar territory, the specific framing of isolation versus independence with the archivist metaphor provides distinctive perspective.</comment>
