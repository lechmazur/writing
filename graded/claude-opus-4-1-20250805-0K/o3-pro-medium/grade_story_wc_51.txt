I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Olivine's motivation to collect and weave burdens is clear and consistent, with her final self-recognition creating genuine cost ("the cost of weaving others while leaving her patterns empty"). The internal contradiction between her role as weaver and her own unwoven state drives the closure effectively, though some interior passages drift toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Olivine measuring her own burden at twelve drams and integrating it into her work, creating clear before/after stakes. The accumulative structure coheres around the burden-collection pattern, though the orientation anchors (who/where/when) could be cleaner in the opening beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bronze grotto functions as both setting and participant, actively responding to Olivine's work ("Bronze plates on the floor separated, revealing a small pit"). The kerosene lamp's manipulation directly controls what burdens manifest, making the environment essential to every choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating burden-weights (three, seven, five, nine drams) until Olivine confronts her own at twelve drams—the heaviest. The "boundary-lessly trapped" sensation intensifies from welcome tool to paralyzing threat before resolution, with clear cost in her inability to be woven by another.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of bearing others' burdens while neglecting one's own emerges organically through the weaving metaphor and crystallizes in "the cost of weaving others while leaving her patterns empty." The final image of snowmelt whispering about burden and weaver agreeing on weight resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistency with inventive compounds ("boundary-lessly trapped") and sustained metaphorical texture. Some passages lean toward elevated register ("whalebone reverie," "fractal weaver") that occasionally distances from immediate sensation, though the voice coheres around its mystical tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("Bronze plates on the floor separated, revealing a small pit lined with mirrored ore"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("shingled hush, layer upon layer of silenced waves") risks opacity, and occasional abstract phrasing ("meaning resurfaced in living color") could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of physically weighing and weaving intangible burdens offers fresh specificity, particularly the precise dram measurements for different griefs. The "orienting properly" method of rotating flame to reveal hidden burdens creates an original magical system that feels earned rather than arbitrary.</comment>
