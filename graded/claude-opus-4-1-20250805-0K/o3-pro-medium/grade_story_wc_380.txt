I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, assessing its publishability in elite venues.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece with hybrid elements. The story builds through layered imagery (whale, salt crystals, gravity pockets) toward a resonant reconfiguration where Kerrin recovers her core memory and understands Tideford's collective amnesia.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kerrin's motivation to recover lost memories drives consistent action, from defying harbor darkness to reading coffee grounds to descending the salt crater. The discovery of her infant self creates genuine internal contradiction—recognizing yet not recognizing herself—with embodied cost ("Tears blurred the crater"). Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution where memories cascade back instantly upon touching the child.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from whale's beaching through coffee-ground divination to salt-crystal revelation, achieving Resonant Reconfiguration when Kerrin recovers her core self and understands the memory-harvesting mechanism. The cost is visceral—years of half-life, forgotten mother and laughter—though the resolution edges toward convenience when the infant simply "merged into Kerrin's chest like smoke."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of setting as active agent: gravity pockets that "tug," salt crystals that "chime like tiny bells," the whale's maw as divination chamber. The salt crystal growing chamber constrains choice (memories trapped, requiring exhumation before dawn) and charges the final image. Minor moments like "Wind rattled fish scales on drying racks" anchor the harbor atmosphere perfectly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal memory loss to town-wide amnesia, with tangible pressure (dawn deadline, gravity pockets pulling her down). The dominant stake—recovering deleted memories—tightens when Kerrin discovers her own infant self is the key. Cost is clear: years of foggy half-life, though the final resolution of "steady hands and steady past" arrives somewhat easily.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the salt-crystal preservation system—memories preserved but erased from minds, suggesting the price of stability. The final image of lanterns mirroring salt crystals' glow resonates without stating a moral. "Even silence can gleam with promise" reweights the opening's "gleaming silence" beautifully, though some thematic threads (gravity/memory connection) remain slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "memories vanished from Tideford minds like gulls blown beyond the headland." POV remains steady through Kerrin's perception, with apt psychic distance shifts during the vision sequence. The prose rhythm accelerates during discovery ("She drew a wick-knife, pried at the lid") though occasionally tips toward elevated register ("sourceless moonlight," "dissolving sodium stars").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied sentence structures. Excellent momentum through the crater descent sequence. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("gleaming silence of dissolving sodium stars"), slight register drift in peak moments, and one instance of abstract phrasing ("gravity balanced"). The "merged into Kerrin's chest like smoke" metaphor strains physical logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-physical-object with the salt crystallization system and gravity pockets creates an original world logic. The coffee-ground divination in "places where time tilted" offers genuine surprise. The concept of one's earliest self-memory being physically separated to maintain cosmic balance is inventive, though the resolution mechanism (touching releases all) is somewhat conventional.</comment>
