I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The balladeer's motivation to "give resonance" to unspoken needs is consistent and drives his encoding actions. His "driftingly alert" state manifests in concrete perception shifts between physical and digital realms. The choice to encode rather than directly express shows character-specific logic, though internal conflict could deepen.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens dominates, with density increasing through color-coding system (violet=sorrow, gold=yearning, teal=hope) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the encoded wall becomes "a memory palace for every orphaned feeling." Cost is visible in the ephemeral nature—only accessible "between lightning and thunder." The closure lands with the balladeer's acceptance of hidden impact over recognition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The courtyard "above the clouds" that exists "only between lightning and thunder" creates temporal constraint that shapes the encoding window. Sensory detail is selective—"hummed like a silver bowl," "wet marble tiles"—and the storm's rhythm drives pacing. The setting actively constrains choice through its fleeting availability.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—articulating unspoken digital needs before "servers rotted"—escalates through the ghost's revelation of "unsent apologies that still pulsed like open circuits." Pressure coheres as storm timing creates urgency. The trade-off is clear: anonymous service over recognition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of "building a mouth for silence" without stating morals. The final image of graffiti as hidden prayers "glowing above morning traffic" reweights the opening's ethereal setting into urban reality. The ghost-in-code concept avoids abstraction through specific digital artifacts—"user logs," "saved drafts."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "driftingly alert" consciousness that perceives both physical and digital simultaneously. Prose rhythm accelerates during the encoding sequence. No dialogue present (not penalized). The lyric compression serves the liminal setting effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong syntactic variety and information density, particularly in the encoding sequence where "Color and sound interlaced until the courtyard became an enormous oscilloscope." Some elevated diction ("balustrades," "oscilloscope") fits the mythic register. Minor repetition of "driftingly alert" serves pattern but could vary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of street art, digital ghosts, and musical encoding creates non-obvious premise. The specific color-emotion coding system and "flower press bolt plate" as rotating stencil pivot show inventive detail. Risk-taking in the liminal setting and ghost-as-aggregated-longing heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
