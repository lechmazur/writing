<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Calder's internal contradiction between wanting admiration and facing shame drives authentic micro-choices throughout, particularly in his ritualistic dismantling of false identity. The cost of exile and self-confrontation is embodied through physical actions (trembling fingers, cutting away fabric). However, the transformation feels slightly rushed for the scope, and some emotional transitions lack the messiness of genuine crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with ritualistic shedding that builds to Earned Stasis—Calder accepts his fraudulent past and commits to truth-telling despite uncertain reception. The closure lands with visible cost (exile, destroyed materials, uncertain future). The con's revelation provides clear causality, though the workshop scene could anchor its temporal relation to the banishment more precisely.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The misty workshop atmosphere and tactile details (silver thread, bone knife, brazier) create a liminal space that mirrors Calder's transition. The chameleon's tail tip functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Some sensory opportunities are missed during the ritual sequences where touch and smell could deepen immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconstructing self-respect versus maintaining deception—escalates through physical acts of destruction and reconstruction. The ritual deepens from cutting words to burning fabric to rewriting truth. However, the conflict lacks external pressure during the workshop scene; all resistance is internal, missing opportunity for complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The chameleon metaphor of adaptation through shedding layers elegantly unifies action and theme without explicit statement. The final image of smoke as "benediction rather than condemnation" reweights the entire ritual. Theme emerges through concrete particulars rather than abstraction, though the "fragile convictions" prompt language occasionally surfaces too directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with controlled psychic distance and purposeful formality that suits the ritualistic tone. Strong perceptual signature in how Calder notices textures and transformations. However, some sentences drift into overly writerly constructions ("diluted wine through the mist") that slightly distance from character voice during emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and strong verb choices. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. However, several instances of elevated diction clash with established register ("velvet field of stars," "patient snakes"), and some metaphors strain clarity. The opening contains minor redundancy in scene-setting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The ritual of literal and metaphorical reconstruction offers a fresh angle on redemption narrative. The specific detail of the chameleon handler using his creature's adaptation as wisdom feels authentic. The story commits to its premise of transformation through deliberate dismantling, though some symbolic conveniences (smoke as benediction) edge toward the expected.</comment>
