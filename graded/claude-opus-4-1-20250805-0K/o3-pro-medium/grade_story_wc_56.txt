I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows a clear because/therefore chain from discovery to moral reckoning to decisive action.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is clear and deepens causally from curiosity to moral obligation as discoveries compound. The internal conflict between vanishing safely versus bearing witness crystallizes in concrete action. Minor deduction for the station man encounter feeling slightly convenient, though it tests the protagonist's resolve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal closure with the narrator becoming "part of the legend" and choosing to expose the truth despite risk - a Decisive Change with visible cost. The because/therefore linkage from discovery to moral choice to action is clean. The sundial's evolution from timepiece to moral compass provides persistent constraint. Slight deduction for the station man's arrival timing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The canal setting actively constrains choices through its narrow passages, hidden strongbox, and watching windows. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("limestone walls sweated cold tears"). The lock gate's final groan charges the ending image. Some spatial choreography could be clearer during the underwater retrieval.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to moral imperative as the ledgers reveal human trafficking. The protagonist's choice to document rather than flee demonstrates clear agency with visible risk ("watchers behind shuttered windows"). The cost is legible in choosing exposure over safety.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the "architecture of lies" being literal ledgers hiding atrocities. The sundial reading "intentions" not hours becomes a resonant metaphor for moral navigation. The final image of the closing lock gate accepting "its unmasking" offers a non-literal answer to the central question about truth versus silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled literary register and selective perception ("Mist lay in bands over the water, cool and luminous as breath made visible"). The perceptual signature holds under pressure. Minor deduction for slight elevation during the station man dialogue that doesn't quite match prior diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied syntax. However, some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("serene upheaval of minute ripples that parted like curtains"). A few instances of register drift ("hindsight clarity pour through me") slightly muddy immediacy without harming closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The sundial as moral compass rather than timepiece offers fresh transformation of the treasure-hunt trope. The specific historical crime (human trafficking via canal barges) grounds the mystery in particulars. The protagonist's evolution from "errant legend seeker" to active witness shows genuine transformation.</comment>
