<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orielle's motivation to preserve memories drives consistent action throughout, with her foxglove regret transforming into purpose when she discovers the stairwell. The internal shift from routine caretaker to active restorer is earned through specific discovery and choice, though the emotional complexity could deepen further under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through sensory layering (mist, glass orchids, sound) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the library transforms from archive to living garden. The closure lands with visible cost—"countless names still slept in dust"—and Orielle's commitment to ongoing work, satisfying the lens requirements.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The opal library setting constrains and enables every choice, from the glass orchids that hold memories to the stairwell mirrors that bloom with recovered names. Sensory detail is exceptional—"silence tasted sweet," "dust into constellations"—with the environment actively shaping Orielle's discovery and the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from routine inspection to chime repair to stairwell discovery to name restoration, each beat deepening the stakes. The cost registers in Orielle's ongoing commitment and the weight of unfinished work, though the pressure could tighten more sharply in the middle section.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete work of preservation—the glass orchids, extinct languages, and restored names create a meditation on memory and cultural loss without stating it. The final image of the library as "both archive and garden" offers a resonant answer to the question of how we honor what's been lost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and inventive imagery ("moon forgot its face," "cloudbone gramophone"). The perceptual signature remains consistent—Orielle notices through sound and light—and the prose modulates effectively from contemplative opening to active discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose maintains high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"Light sifted through the opalescent glass and scattered prisms across her gloves" advances action while revealing character and world. Some mild repetition around "deserted marvels" and occasional abstract phrasing ("museum of extinct feelings") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of library-as-living-archive with glass orchids holding memories and a sonic restoration system feels fresh and inevitable. The specific detail of names regaining mouths when touched by sound transforms familiar preservation themes through unique worldbuilding.</comment>
