grade_story_wc_331.txt
I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric rigorously.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than causal plot mechanics, with density increase toward the discovery of the unwritten corridor.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Hollis's motivation as a quester for pre-story spaces is clear and embodied through concrete actions (chalk diagram, scarf placement). His "sanely eccentric" nature manifests in specific behaviors rather than labels. The final renunciation ("We will come when you learn to shelve silence") earns closure through his acceptance, though internal contradiction could be more visceral during the quest itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Hollis accepts he must "arrange the quiet that invites them" rather than seize stories - a clear before/after with felt cost of continued waiting. The accumulative lens holds as hyperbolic geometry, analog memories, and silence patterns build toward the corridor's revelation. Orientation anchors (librarian, 2am, scientific poetry library) establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The library setting actively constrains choices (patron interruption forcing invisibility while working). Micro-settings like the chalk Poincaré disk and scarf as "compass rose" function as environmental pressure points. The bioluminescent footnotes and "translucent paragraphs" in the unwritten corridor create a vivid alternate space that charges the final image of stories "breathing" behind him.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding where stories live before embodiment) signals early and tightens when the unwritten corridor opens but denies immediate fulfillment. The patron interruption creates genuine obstacle to his work. Cost becomes legible when stories refuse to come until he learns to "shelve silence" - foreclosing immediate success while opening future possibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "observed solitude" as creation's natural climate, never stated but embodied in Hollis's night work and the lonely corridor. The final image of unwritten stories "breathing...knowing now precisely where they might someday live" offers resonant non-literal answer to the quest. Analog memories as palimpsest of library history adds textural depth without forcing symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Hollis notices "quarks with couplets" and "fluorescent half-light." Voice modulates effectively from contemplative observation to wonder in the corridor ("air itself was narrative potential"). No dialogue present to evaluate. The prose maintains consistent scholarly-poetic register appropriate to the character without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("sanely eccentric mind began its nightly routine" characterizes while advancing). Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, particularly in the corridor sequence. Minor figurative density in places ("moths around an idea") but serves the accumulative pattern. No loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of a library corridor where unwritten stories exist as "translucent paragraphs" offers fresh angle on creation mythology. Hyperbolic geometry as method for finding narrative space transforms mathematical concept into literary device. The synthesis feels earned through specific details though the core "stories waiting to be written" concept has precedents.</comment>
