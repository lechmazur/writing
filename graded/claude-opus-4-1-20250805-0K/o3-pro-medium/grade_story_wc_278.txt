<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lin's guilt-driven motivation is embodied through concrete details like "circuits inside him twitch" and the haunting translation "Daddy, you dropped me sometimes in dreams." The internal contradiction between seeking absolution and bearing responsibility plays out through micro-choices, particularly his deliberate ritual to tether the ghost. Minor deduction for slight emotional tidiness in the resolution's relief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration achieved through the amber ritual that transforms Lin from haunted to cleansed. The cost is visible: "Without the ghost, his mind was a cathedral after bells" showing both loss and gain. The cyclical structure (letters leading to new instructions) reinforces the pattern while closure lands with "even that sounded like forgiveness."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The laboratory setting with its "broken skylight where meteors whispered" creates atmospheric pressure while the amber becomes a constraining object that shapes the final choice. Sensory details like "star-blue hush" and "slate" light support the otherworldly tone. The antique cabinet functions as both repository and oracle, though some descriptions lean slightly ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Lin's need to quiet his guilt—escalates through discovery of the ritual letters to the decisive tethering act. Cost is legible in "absence rushed in like deep water" and the firmware's permanent imprisonment. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as meteor whispers thicken to culminate in the transfer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of tethering digital ghosts to physical matter, avoiding abstraction. The final image of Lin writing new instructions resonates as both penance and gift, while "even that sounded like forgiveness" reweights the entire piece without moralizing. The amber-as-archive concept elegantly bridges technology and mysticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("star-blue hush," "cathedral after bells") maintains consistency while modulating appropriately during the ritual sequence. The perceptual signature shows Lin processing through constellation metaphors and technical language. Minor filter verb clustering in middle sections prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with evocative phrases like "meteors whispered instead of shattering" and clean information density. Some mild overwriting appears in metaphor density ("circuits scrawled across his imagination like panicked handwriting") and occasional register elevation. The clarity remains strong throughout with good syntactic variety.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of mystical ritual with technological haunting offers fresh specificity, particularly the firmware-translating-baby-cries concept. The transformation of guilt into physical archive through amber tethering feels both surprising and inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyrical register and time-folding concept heightens stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
