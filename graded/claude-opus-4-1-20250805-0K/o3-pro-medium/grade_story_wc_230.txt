<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ilya's rational methodology contrasted with involuntary truth-telling creates genuine internal conflict, and his abandonment confession carries embodied cost ("tasting rust and orchard mold"). The collaboration with Mara shows meaningful change through community-building rather than isolation, though some emotional transitions could be more contradictory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and metaphors build toward Ilya's shift from solitude to community collaboration. The closure lands with visible cost (confession about abandoning his sister) and reconfigures his approach from seeking individual cure to spreading collective healing. Causality occasionally softens but the pattern accumulation drives the ending effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hanging orchard with fruit "like lanterns in distress" and cables as "handrails in farewell" creates vivid, POV-filtered setting that constrains movement and discovery. The ravine's physical challenge and storm-battered atmosphere mirror Ilya's psychological state. Setting actively shapes the relic's discovery location and the precarious path back.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal survival through empathy overload to communal healing strategy, with the glass eye discovery creating genuine risk (council persecution). The tightening occurs when Ilya must speak his feared memory as payment, though middle pressure could intensify further. Cost is visible in the sister confession and risk of discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the glass eye doesn't "occlude empathy entirely" but "filters despair so care could pass unharmed." The shift from seeking anesthetic to finding scaffolding resonates without moralizing. The final image of hearts "agreeing on a safer rhythm" reweights the empathy virus from curse to manageable condition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("Rain threaded silver needles") and character-specific perception (rational methodology, deliberate logic). Some register elevation in peak moments ("fractured grace of surviving society") slightly exceeds Ilya's established lexicon. Dialogue between Ilya and Mara carries authentic subtext about risk and secrecy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong sensory specificity ("tasting rust and orchard mold," "knobs smelling of wet parchment") with good information density. Minor template cadence in middle sections ("He gathered...He realized...") and occasional abstract phrasing ("psychological safety") that could be more embodied. Prose generally propels forward with varied rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The empathy virus forcing involuntary truth combines freshly with the smuggled cure concept, avoiding typical pandemic tropes. The glass eye's specific payment mechanism (speaking feared memory) and partial filtering effect show genuine originality. The fungus-spore knowledge distribution method offers an inventive resistance strategy.</comment>
