I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, identifying the inferred drive lens and assessing each category accordingly.

**Inferred Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mareth's insomnia transforms into peaceful sleep through the garden's alchemical process.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mareth's motivation is clear and embodied through the shell's echoing torment and her determination to "photosynthesize pain into beauty." The internal conflict between exhaustion and creative drive manifests concretely through her journey to the garden. The transformation from insomnia to sleep feels earned through the blossom armistice ritual, though the elder-self device strains psychological realism slightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from isolation through journey to transformation, with the garden scene providing a Resonant Reconfiguration where insomnia becomes generative rather than destructive. The postcard serves as an effective catalyst, and the cost is visible in Mareth's trembling hands and the "war inside her" that must cease. The elder-self meeting pushes credibility but doesn't break the accumulative logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The shell's spiral architecture constrains and shapes Mareth's experience throughout, from amplifying her insomnia to providing the labyrinthine path outward. Rich sensory detail ("cathedral echoes," "pearly dust," "calcium moonscape") creates a vivid underwater dreamscape. The garden where "wounds sprouted petals" provides the crucial setting that enables transformation, directly constraining the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming pain into beauty versus remaining trapped in torment—intensifies through the journey from shell to garden. The blossom armistice represents a meaningful deepening where internal war must cease, with visible cost in releasing control ("poems would now dream on their own"). Escalation follows the accumulative pattern effectively, though lacks the sharp reversal a causal story might offer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of photosynthesis—converting darkness to light, pain to beauty. The garden where "wounds sprouted petals" embodies this without stating it explicitly. The final image of the shell no longer echoing "only brine but the gentle breathing of a poet finally asleep" provides resonant closure that reweights all prior suffering.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive lyrical voice maintains consistency through elaborate metaphors ("time stretched across centuries of longing like salted taffy"). The perceptual signature—seeing cosmic patterns in shells, experiencing time as elastic—remains character-specific throughout. Occasional overwriting ("shyly unstoppable shimmer") doesn't significantly mar the controlled poetic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though density of figurative language occasionally overwhelms ("reef-shadow joy," "contraband comfort" in close succession). Some paraphrase loops appear ("declared a blossom armistice" repeats the concept without advancement). Information density is high and momentum generally sustained, but metaphor-heavy passages sometimes sacrifice clarity for poetry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of meeting one's future self to heal present wounds offers a fresh angle on the healing journey trope. The specific synthesis of marine biology imagery with cosmic elements ("galaxy postcard," "nebula mirroring the shell") creates memorable texture. The transformation of insomnia into a generative force rather than simple cure shows originality.</comment>
