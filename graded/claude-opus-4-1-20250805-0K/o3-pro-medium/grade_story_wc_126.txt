<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Selene's motivation to find music in the silence is embodied through concrete actions—wading through water, using her bowl to catch bubbles, cutting nets with violin strings. Her acoustic perception shapes every choice, though the internal contradiction between loss and hope could be more viscerally conflicted. The final choice to leave the bowl for others shows earned generosity with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Selene unbinds both tree and silence, creating new music from wreckage. The cost is visible in her sacrificed strings and the physical labor of freeing the sapling. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse functions as more than setting—it constrains movement through waist-deep water and provides the acoustic architecture that shapes Selene's choices. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "rusted ribs of hulls like broken harps," "dead apple branches that thrust upward like question marks." The environment directly enables the final discovery and transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding/creating music in a silenced world—deepens through acoustic mapping, the discovery of the trapped sapling, and the sacrifice of violin strings. The escalation from listening to cutting to playing shows clear progression with visible cost. The final note from the sapling that "promised more" crystallizes the earned change.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: beauty lives in incompletion, shown through the unfinished composer's chord, the trapped sapling, and Selene's willingness to leave imperfections standing. The family tradition of praising "half-built boats or songs missing verses" anchors this philosophy in lived experience. The ending reweights the chronic hush as fertile ground rather than mere absence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric precision with controlled rhythm that modulates with discovery: short, declarative sentences for movement, longer flowing lines for revelation. Selene's acoustic perception colors every observation—she "maps space the way bats once did." No dialogue appears, maintaining the story's commitment to silence and sound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Air bubbles escaped the bark and blossomed into faint, glassy whistles" combines action, transformation, and acoustic detail. Some figurative density in descriptive passages ("magnificent simplicity," "chronic hush") but these establish pattern early. Strong syntactic variety maintains momentum through the water-slowed action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of acoustic perception in a post-apocalyptic silence offers fresh specificity—not just any musician but one who can decode reflected sound. The trapped sapling releasing a dead composer's music transforms the familiar "nature reclaims ruins" trope. The family tradition of finding beauty in incompletion provides unique philosophical grounding.</comment>
