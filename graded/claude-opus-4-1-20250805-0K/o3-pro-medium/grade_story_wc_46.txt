I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - The story builds through layered imagery and sensory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Liora transforms sea glass into luminescent water lilies, creating "light without fire."

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to "share light without using fire" drives consistent action through concrete gestures (polishing glass, releasing the pearl). Her internal experience layers effectively through embodied details like "hand trembled" and the tear creating the pearl's nucleus. The final choice to release rather than keep the stillness shows earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear accumulative structure builds from entering the grotto through polishing ritual to releasing light into the pool. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the pearl transforms the pool into floating lilies of light, fulfilling Liora's vow with felt cost ("empty satchel and a lighter heartbeat"). Who/where/when anchored early through "dawn," "grotto," and "Liora."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto functions as active setting - its "smooth granite table" enables the polishing ritual, the underground pool receives the transformation. Sensory details like "briny hush" and "wet stone" create atmosphere while the petroglyphs add layered history. The turquoise glass and pool directly constrain and enable the central transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on creating "light without fire" - pressure builds through the polishing ritual's accumulation toward the pearl's emergence. The decisive moment when "tear met shard" creates the nucleus shows agency driving transformation. Cost appears in releasing the pearl rather than keeping it ("must be offered, not kept"), though escalation could intensify further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of light without destruction. The "zephyr bloom" tone (half breeze, half blossom) manifests literally in the light petals. The final image of villagers navigating "without torches" while Liora carries only emptiness resonates without stating a moral - sharing requires release.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through lyrical compression ("earthbound star watcher") and consistent elevated register fitting the mythic tone. POV remains stable in close third. Some filter phrases ("She felt," "She recognized") could strengthen through direct perception, but perceptual signature shows in how Liora reads the grotto through astronomical metaphors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves lyrical density with phrases like "memories resurface, delicate bubbles rising through dark water." Some repetitive structures appear ("She [verb]" opens multiple sentences in succession). Information density generally high, though occasional abstraction ("patient brilliance") could ground further in concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of star-watching with underwater transformation creates non-obvious angle. The concept of "pearl of stillness" as radiating moment rather than object shows originality. Risk-taking appears in the lyrical accumulative structure and the choice to make light through tears and polishing rather than conventional magic.</comment>
