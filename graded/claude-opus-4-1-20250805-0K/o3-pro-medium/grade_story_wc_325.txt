<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's claustrophobia creates genuine internal tension against her spelunking profession, with embodied stress ("chest fluttered," "tight-throat panic") and contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to track the vapor-souls carries visible cost through her physical discomfort, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("crowding comfort of shared purpose").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where invisible souls gain vapor-bodies and Lira commits to future tracking. The phase gate activation creates decisive change with clear cost (risking drowning, enduring claustrophobia), and the final image of salt footprints crystallizes her ongoing commitment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The decaying pier and flooded facility constrain action through tidal timing and create visceral pressure ("walls sweating brine," "moonlit water pulse above like a breathing ceiling"). The phase gate and undersea cables function as setting elements that enable the central transformation, directly shaping Lira's choices and the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating sensory pressure and narrowing time constraints as Lira descends, activates the gate despite alarms, then races the returning tide. The cost is legible in her physical struggle and the risk of drowning, though the vapor-souls' appearance could create stronger immediate opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of remembering the forgotten emerges organically through concrete action (descending to abandoned facility, activating phase gate for ghostly archives). The final image of invisible footprints drying into salt offers a resonant non-literal answer about memory's persistence without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature filters everything through Lira's spelunker-awareness and synesthetic tracking ability ("glints," "invisible footprints"). Prose rhythm accelerates during the escape sequence, and specialized vocabulary ("phase transitions," "desalination rates") remains consistent with the research facility setting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("Salt wind sighed," "crashing hush") but occasional overwrought metaphors ("whispers rubbing copper jackets raw against barnacles") and some abstract phrasing ("crowding comfort of shared purpose"). Information density is high and momentum sustained, though a few lines edge toward purple prose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of tracking invisible things through phase transitions offers a fresh angle on ghost stories and memory preservation. The specific synthesis of underwater research facility, tidal constraints, and vapor-soul archives feels original, though some elements (forgotten facility, ghostly technicians) draw on familiar tropes.</comment>
