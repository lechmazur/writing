I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kilor's motivation to "sandpaper rough memories" drives consistent action through taste-as-medium, and Sel's guilt over Ravin's Well creates genuine internal conflict. The final choice of self-sacrifice emerges from established character logic. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of memory manipulation reducing embodied emotion in places.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—Kilor's self-imprisonment creates Charged Poise where cost is felt through "taste of iron remains." The coral pavilion's growing agency and the contagion mechanism create coherent escalation. Slight weakness in the speed of Kilor's shift from professional to sacrificial motivation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The coral pavilion functions as micro-setting that constrains choice through its demand for "a living echo to buffer its ancient grief." Sensory detail like "melt-drop rang like a pinched bell" and "limestone dust, panicked sweat" grounds the abstract concept. The fortress environment actively shapes the ending through rain/desert tension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional commission to existential threat as the pavilion "would unfreeze completely and drown the fortress." The contagion mechanism creates genuine cost when "sorrow ricocheted back." The dominant stake of removing vs redistributing remorse tightens effectively, though the pavilion's sudden ultimatum feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the impossibility of erasing guilt—"remorse could not be removed, only redistributed." The final image of Sel breathing "without armor" resonates without stating a moral. The coral as repository for ancient grief creates layered meaning about collective memory and personal responsibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with phrases like "sturdy brittle" and "sandpaper rough memories" creating textural coherence. POV control remains tight to Kilor with selective perception of taste/memory. The prose rhythm accelerates during the contagion sequence and settles into lyric resolution. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong syntactic variety and information density—"fortress loomed in jagged ochre relief" does triple work. Some elevated diction ("prehuman tides," "fossilized ripple") occasionally strains but serves the mythic tone. Clean prose with purposeful compression, though "sandpaper rough memories" appears three times.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of a chef who tastes memories and must absorb them himself is genuinely fresh. The coral pavilion as ancient grief repository transforms the expected haunted-object trope. Risk-taking in the abstract premise pays off through concrete sensory grounding and the ironic reversal of healer becoming vessel.</comment>
