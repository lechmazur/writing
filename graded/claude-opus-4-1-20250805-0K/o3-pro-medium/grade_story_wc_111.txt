<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orlan's motivation to escape his father's legacy of "mended deception" drives concrete choices through polishing the marble and engaging with the garden's consciousness. The internal contradiction between despising deception yet carrying the marbles creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract resolution of "faith had finally answered" which edges toward thematic echo rather than embodied completion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural design where polishing the marble triggers the garden's recognition, redistributing hoarded luck through the "Gardener" register. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost: "spine still curved yet lighter" shows transformation with retained burden. The maze's rearrangement and new mysteries signal ongoing exchange rather than tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The garden maze constrains and enables choices throughout - from withered roses "blooming while withering simultaneously" to roots gripping the luck machinery. The environment actively participates through hedge rearrangement and root-pulse synchronization with the polished marble. Setting becomes co-agent rather than backdrop, directly shaping the closure's "Gardener" designation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal inheritance burden to systemic redistribution of luck through the garden's agency. The pressure builds through texture accumulation: polishing intensifies to maze transformation to sundial recalibration. Cost is visible in the crowd's gauges "dimming, then glowing" as Orlan's hoarded luck redistributes, though the personal price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "blooming withering" - simultaneous creation and decay as truth. The polishing transforms "mended deception into transparency," suggesting authentic engagement over false repair. The garden's measurement of faith versus luck offers resonant complexity without moralizing, though "faith had finally answered" edges toward explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "Mist hugged the garden maze at dawn, weaving through hedges like breath from something sleeping and old." POV maintains consistent limited perspective with selective perception fitting a gardener's expertise. Deduction for occasional register elevation that strains credibility ("calibrating invisible scales," "subterranean conversation").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong imagery and rhythm in key passages, particularly the opening and transformation sequence. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("commemorating small victories elaborately," "hitherto uncharted register") and slight overwriting in metaphorical density during the climax that obscures immediate clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of luck-as-measurable-commodity with garden consciousness creates non-obvious premise. The "Gardener" register as alternative to fortune metrics offers genuine originality. The simultaneous blooming-withering roses embody paradox throughout rather than resolving to safety. Slight deduction for the familiar father's-shadow setup.</comment>
