<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The backwards-aging conceit drives Mira's characterization effectively, with her wisdom-youth paradox creating genuine tension. Rowan's transformation from impatience to dissolution shows clear internal conflict acting in scene, particularly in his pacing the chalk circle until "exhaustion cooled his thirst." The final vanishing represents earned change through embodied struggle, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("perfect arrival where nothing extraneous remained").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds well with density increasing toward Rowan's dissolution. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Rowan vanishes yet remains "nearer than breath," with cost visible in the "faint imprint of warmth" and Mira's conscious withholding. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3, and the single-scene structure maintains coherent pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto's iron dust that "sang faintly" and affects "compass needles and memories alike" creates a vivid micro-setting that directly enables the vanishing. The floating platform and silver pond work as active elements, particularly the backwards ripples that become Rowan's teaching medium. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("smelling salts moonlight").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake of learning to vanish progresses through clear escalation: stone-throwing lesson, chalk circle paradox, then dissolution. Rowan's agency drives the transformation when he steps into the circle "without desire," triggering the grotto's response. Cost appears in his terror and the permanent change implied by Mira not calling him back, though the stakes could sharpen further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The vanishing-to-appear paradox emerges organically through action rather than statement. The backwards ripples converging to show Rowan "himself absent" creates powerful dramatic irony. Theme develops through the concrete image of the "silhouette of possibility" and Mira's restraint as "final kindness," avoiding explicit moralizing while exploring presence/absence with genuine complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains clean focalization, shifting smoothly between Mira's and Rowan's perspectives at natural breaks. The prose has distinct texture with phrases like "night breathed through the sycamores" and controlled psychic distance modulation. Some diction elevates beyond natural voice ("untouchable secrecy"), but rhythm effectively varies with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in setting-character integration. However, register drift appears in peak moments ("perfect arrival where nothing extraneous remained," "widening dawn") that clash with established voice. Some metaphors strain clarity ("smelling salts moonlight"), and occasional template cadence emerges in the descriptive passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The backwards-aging researcher concept offers fresh perspective on mentorship, with time flowing opposite to wisdom accumulation. The vanishing-as-arrival paradox transforms expected dissolution tropes. While the meditation-platform-mystical-teaching setup has familiar elements, the specific execution through pond ripples and magnetic grotto creates memorable particularity.</comment>
