<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eira's motivation to prove that empty spaces remember is consistently embodied through concrete actions—categorizing clouds by emotion, releasing ballast to create measurable absence, transmitting her findings, then stepping into the void herself. Her internal contradictions (scientific rigor vs. grandmother's folk wisdom) create authentic tension, and her final choice to let go carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through pattern accretion (emotional cloud taxonomy, spooled wholeness, memory compression) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Eira's fall becomes proof of her hypothesis. The closure lands with clear cost—her physical sacrifice validates that "empty spaces remember who trusted them." Minor deduction for slightly abstract conceptual framework that occasionally drifts from concrete scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The gondola functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (broken string, falling screw, limited time aloft) and charges the final image when it "drifts lighter without her." Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (dusty starlight, ozone-scented ink), though some descriptions edge toward ornamental ("fragrant air").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation follows accumulative logic as Eira moves from observation to experimentation to embodied proof, with each action raising stakes—releasing ballast creates "audible hush," transmitting data as tonal pips, finally stepping into absence herself. The cost is unmistakable in her fall, though middle pressure could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the taxonomy of emotional clouds, the falling screw memorialized, sand creating recordable absence—all building toward the resonant final image where the sky itself acknowledges the transaction. The ending reweights all prior observation as preparation for this ultimate proof, avoiding explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through Eira's scientific-poetic lens ("hope ascending, sorrow condensate"), with consistent elevated register appropriate to her character. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("dusty starlight prickles," "quietly explosive revelation") but rhythm modulates effectively with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs, but several instances of ornamental language slow momentum ("crib abandoned in high wind," "centuries of whispered secrets"). Template constructions appear ("She has come to prove," "She senses," "She suddenly understands") and some metaphors strain clarity ("spooled wholeness now humming").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of categorizing clouds by emotion as scientific method offers genuine freshness, synthesizing meteorology with folk wisdom in non-obvious ways. The specific synthesis feels earned through Eira's particular backstory and the story commits fully to its conceptual logic, though some elements (brass telescope humming) edge toward convenience.</comment>
