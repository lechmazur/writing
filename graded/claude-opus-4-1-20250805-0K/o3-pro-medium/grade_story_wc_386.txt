I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece. The story builds through layered imagery (glacier/wreck/glass/memory), pattern accumulation (windows of connection, frozen/melted states), and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration where the glacier transforms from tomb to hymn-space through truth's exposure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as ghost whisperer is grounded in specific expertise ("weave truth carefully from rusted lies"), and her final choice to expose uncomfortable truth carries visible cost in the monks' resistance. The lighthouse keeper's characterization through dream-cameos and his need "to salvage something pure" creates genuine pathos. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional beats ("space instead of absence").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the glacier transforms from "tomb wearing a halo" to crying/glittering simultaneity, with visible cost in the monks' discomfort and the keeper's release. The accumulative lens holds consistently through imagery layering and pattern breaks. Orientation anchors clearly (wreck-diver, glacier, monks, shrine). Minor deduction for slightly abstract cost articulation in the final lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glacier-as-setting brilliantly constrains and enables: it entombs the keeper, houses the shrine, and ultimately transforms into "windows of connection." Vivid sensory work ("breath shimmering like borrowed starlight," "resinous smoke"). The melted snow globe functions as crucial micro-setting that bridges wreck and glacier. Setting actively shapes the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from monks' silence through dream-navigation to confronting denial, with Mara's exposure of truth as the decisive act. The glacier's tremor and subsequent transformation show clear cost and consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara recognizes they're inside the snow globe's perspective. Slightly abstract in places but pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the central metaphor of "windows of connection" becoming "mirrors of loneliness" through denial, then transforming to true connection through truth. The ending's "space instead of absence" and pilgrims seeing themselves in glitter offers resonant non-literal answer. Minor deduction for one instance of slight abstraction ("birth hymns if truth were given room").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("wreck-diver ghost whisperer," "candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice"). Perceptual signature clear in how Mara reads haunting through objects and dreams. Psychic distance modulates effectively from external observation to dream-immersion. Some elevated diction occasionally strains POV credibility ("constellation," "desecration").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and good momentum. Information density high in most beats. However, several instances of elevated register drift ("trembling constellation," "unfinnished memory"), some abstract phrasing ("space instead of absence"), and occasional redundancy (explaining what's shown). No major loops but clarity occasionally sacrificed for lyricism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story, dream-navigation, and glacier-as-tomb creates memorable premise. The snow globe as window between wreck and glacier is ingenious. Mara's method of tracking hauntings through dream cameos feels original. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure pays off with coherent closure. Transforms familiar ghost-whisperer trope through specific maritime and glacial details.</comment>
