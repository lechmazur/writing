grade_story_wc_233.txt
I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows a clear because/therefore chain from the queen's dreams to her journey to the grotto, discovery of truth, and decision to abdicate.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sereya's internal conflict between sovereignty and conscience drives credible choices, with the revelation about her sister creating genuine moral weight. The transformation from ruler to "pilgrim" is earned through concrete discovery, though Riall remains underdeveloped as mere loyal support.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal linkage from dreams to journey to revelation to abdication, with the orb's bleeding starlight serving as both literal discovery and metaphorical truth. The closure lands with visible cost ("unseat her," "toppled palaces"), though the sister revelation feels slightly convenient despite its thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto functions as transformative setting that constrains choice through its revelatory orb. Vivid sensory details ("stalactites hung like organ pipes," "each drop that fell rang a note only nerves could hear") create atmosphere while the grotto's properties directly enable the story's closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal nightmares to sovereignty to moral reckoning, with the orb revelation forcing a clear trade-off between power and integrity. The cost is legible ("shredded her name from history"), though the middle section could tighten the pressure between discovery and decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The bleeding starlight metaphor elegantly connects personal guilt to cosmic wound, with the theme of power's moral cost emerging through concrete action rather than statement. The final image of "slow mending of the wounded stars" resonates without moralizing, though the sister revelation borders on convenient moral clarity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with distinctive voice ("lacquered with applause," "lacy menace"). Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("memories ossified," "scripture she had never learned") but rhythm generally supports the mythic tone without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("luminescence seeping through invisible wounds to pool on the stone in quivering runes"). Some repetitive constructions ("Sereya felt," "Sereya knelt," "Sereya rose") could vary, but momentum remains steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The bleeding starlight concept offers fresh angle on power's corruption, with the physical manifestation of conscience as cosmic wound avoiding abstraction. The grotto-as-confessional and fireflies-as-restored-stars show imaginative synthesis, though the sister usurpation is familiar territory.</comment>
