<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to find the sacred in ordinary vanishings drives credible choices throughout, with embodied details like "testing soil with fingertips" revealing character under quiet pressure. The transformation from cataloguer to active insurgent lands with earned cost—accepting that "noticing is only half the task." Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("latent gratitude begins to sprout") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from seedball planting through tea ceremony to Elias's final vow, with Resonant Reconfiguration landing in "sacredness is merely the ordinary relieved of its disguise." Cost is legible in his acceptance of complicity ("watched without intervening") and commitment to ongoing work. The piece teaches its pattern of quiet accumulation early and pays it off through Madam Ko's validation of "small defiances."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard constrains choices effectively—its forgotten status enables the tea house meeting, and specific details like "vines stitching lattices where architects once plotted marble" create lived-in texture. The vanished bakery's bread carries weight as both relic and communion object. Deduction for some generic descriptors ("wet leafscape") and because setting doesn't quite reach the 9+ threshold of fundamentally constraining the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen appropriately for accumulative mode as Elias moves from cataloguing loss to active intervention, with the tea ceremony crystallizing his guilt about passive observation. The cost of his choice—committing to "heuristically gentle insurgency" despite no guarantee of success—is visible. Missing higher bands because escalation relies more on revelation than active pressure, though this fits the contemplative tone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the guerrilla gardening metaphor and tea ceremony, with "roots do not require certainty to push downward" resonating beyond literal planting. The final image of Elias disappearing "as unnoticed as moss on stone" offers a non-literal answer about sacred resistance. Slight deduction for occasionally explicit thematic statements like "neglected places, like neglected people, bloom."]</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains contemplative register with selective perception like "scent of wet mint" and character-specific diction ("creeping normality noticer"). Dialogue between Elias and Madam Ko carries appropriate subtext about complicity and action. Deductions for register drift into elevated diction not fully earned by POV ("tenuous absolution arrives only when questions are postponed") and some filter-heavy passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("steam shaping a fleeting dragon") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing. Template cadence appears in middle sections ("Elias feels... Elias admits... Elias closes"), and metaphorical density sometimes obscures rather than clarifies ("latent gratitude begins to sprout"). The closing image lands cleanly, preventing lower score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The guerrilla gardening frame offers a fresh angle on urban resistance, with specific details like seedballs and the tea house ritual avoiding generic protest narrative. The synthesis of cataloguing loss and planting alternatives feels earned. Doesn't reach higher bands due to some familiar beats (wise elder figure, seeker receives wisdom) that aren't sufficiently transformed.</comment>
