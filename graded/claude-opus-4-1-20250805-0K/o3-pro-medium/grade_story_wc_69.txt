I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This operates as an Accumulative/Textural piece, building density through repetition of silence/sound imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the city transforms through collective harmony.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a wandering teacher who "braids diverse voices" is clear and consistent, with the choice to work with exiled brawlers showing tactical wisdom. The choir members' transformation from carrying "weapons of their trade: arguments, statistics, and grudges" to finding harmony shows earned change through concrete practice. Minor deduction for the councilors' too-swift emotional conversion lacking sufficient embodied resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively as the rosette transforms from mysterious object to catalyst for civic harmony, with visible cost in the choir's surrendered grudges and Mara's departure. The accumulative structure builds through nightly rehearsals toward the councilors' arrival, creating coherent pressure. Slight weakness in the councilors' transformation happening too easily without sufficient dramatized resistance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The velvet library with its "burgundy drapes" and "map alcove" with "queer acoustics" actively shapes the story—the acoustic pocket enables the choir's formation and the library itself "learns across unlearning hatred." Setting details like "dust motes that shone like lanterns" integrate with action. The library's transformation from "traveled stillness" to resonant sanctuary demonstrates setting as active participant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual resistance ("each carrying the weapons of their trade") through collective harmony to civic transformation when councilors arrive "summoned by rumors of seditious gatherings." The cost manifests in surrendered arguments and Mara's departure. The councilors' conversion lacks sufficient resistance—their suspicion dissolves too quickly for maximum impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of "harmonizing by subtracting noise"—a powerful metaphor for civil discourse. The rosette as silent center that "siphoned bitterness and returned sweeter overtones" avoids heavy-handedness. The ending's "city humming in unfamiliar peace" resonates without moralizing, though "braiding diverse voices into tomorrow" edges toward explicit theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "expectantly resigned" and "traveled stillness" creating distinctive texture. The prose modulates effectively from contemplative opening to active rehearsal scenes. Minor weakness in dialogue being minimal and somewhat formal ("I have come...to braid diverse voices"), though this fits the elevated register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery like "the rosette at the center...like the hollow of a long-absent instrument seeking strings." Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("denote more than their letters," "across unlearning hatred"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of using silence and subtraction rather than addition to create harmony offers fresh insight into conflict resolution. The specific detail of exiled debaters becoming a choir transforms the familiar "bringing people together" trope. The rosette as a soundhole without its instrument provides an original image, though the councilors' instant transformation feels somewhat conventional.</comment>
