I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category against publishability standards.

**Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through pattern accumulation (whispers, tapestry fragments, hidden meanings) toward a resonant reconfiguration where Milo delivers closure to both the dead and Rowan through the sovereign case.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Milo's characterization succeeds through embodied perception ("heart scuttling like a beetle") and his consistent trait of listening to what others cannot hear. His choice to follow the tapestry map and deliver the sovereign case to Rowan shows clear motivation with visible cost - he sacrifices sleep and comfort to complete this task. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around the whispers' nature.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres well, building from cemetery whispers through tapestry discovery to final delivery of forgiveness. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Milo places the sovereign case under Rowan's hand, allowing buried regret to surface for healing. Cost is visible in Milo's nocturnal labor and the emotional weight of mediating between living and dead. Slight opacity around the exact mechanism of how intentions become tangible weakens causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric grounding with "Night seeped over Marrow Glen, rolling like blue velvet" and the cobalt silo's "grainy scent of forgotten harvests." The cemetery, silo, and tapestry room create distinct spatial zones that enable Milo's journey. The yew tree and unmarked plot provide crucial final anchoring. Setting actively shapes choices through the map's guidance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity about whispers to responsibility for resolving collective grief. The tapestry reveals increasing pressure as "every color he straightens releases a vision." The dominant stake - discovering and addressing unresolved intentions - tightens when Milo must physically manifest the painted spade. Some cost ambiguity in the middle sections prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete image system of buried objects, unfinished tapestries, and undelivered apologies. The final harmonies that "promise no map will again be left unfinished" resonantly answers the question of how the living serve the dead. The sovereign case transforms from container of coins to vessel of forgiveness without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("lunar milk," "velveteen gloom") that matches Milo's liminal position between worlds. POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Some elevated diction ("calcium choir," "metronome heart") occasionally strains against the gardener protagonist but serves the otherworldly atmosphere. Clean free indirect style throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful compression. Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece. Some density issues with figurative language ("rolling like blue velvet," "milk," "beetle," "metronome" in close succession) and occasional abstract phrasing ("intentions lying restless") that could be more concrete. No significant loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a cemetery gardener who mediates between living and dead through found objects offers fresh perspective on grief and forgiveness. The tapestry-as-map device and the transformation of chess piece into apology vessel show genuine ingenuity. The specific detail of Rowan's buried regret beside an unmarked plot elevates beyond generic ghost story territory.</comment>
