<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's discovery of being a replacement creates genuine internal conflict between performed identity and self-determination, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the roof scene. The final choice to expose the conspiracy while performing the stunt demonstrates earned agency with visible cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("vulnerability is power") and slightly convenient resolution of crew loyalty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore linkage from discovery of death records through exposure of murder plot to final liberating jump. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost (risking death, losing identity) and the protagonist's broadcast transforms the situation irreversibly. The hidden cables feel slightly convenient but don't break causality since the engineer's dismissal was established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setting anchors early with "sagging roof of the rusted library under stars" and the desert wind creates atmosphere. The glass atrium and hidden cables constrain the final choice meaningfully. However, the library setting could be more specific to Hollywood/film production, and some details feel generic rather than lived-in through this particular POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal fear through identity crisis to life-threatening conspiracy, with the murder-bonus discovery forcing the protagonist's hand. The final jump carries genuine mortal risk despite the safety cables since their discovery wasn't guaranteed. Cost is visible in the shattered identity and public exposure, though the crew's instant solidarity slightly softens consequences.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of constructed versus authentic identity emerges through concrete action rather than statement, with the seashell serving as a touchstone between past and present selves. The ending reweights "vulnerability is power" through dramatized risk rather than assertion. Some thematic articulation feels explicit ("I was nobody and everyone") but the final image of walking toward an unnamed future resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent perspective of a stunt performer processing shock through action-oriented perception ("rehearsing a fall I dreaded"). Dialogue carries subtext effectively (child's whispered warning, director's economic metaphor). Minor register drift in philosophical moments ("porous all selves are") but rhythm control during the climactic jump sequence shows strong craft.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence lengths and concrete action, particularly in discovery and jump sequences. Some metaphorical excess ("seashell telling me so," "galaxies") and occasional abstract phrasing ("identity could be edited again") create minor drag. The final image lands cleanly with "walked toward whatever name I would answer to next."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of a stunt double discovering they're a surgical replacement offers fresh angle on identity thriller. The child's cast as cipher delivery and the live broadcast exposure show inventive plotting. Transformation of vulnerability from weakness to weapon through public performance demonstrates conceptual follow-through, though some elements feel slightly derivative of paranoid thriller conventions.</comment>
