<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tomas's internal contradiction between exile's shame and his pursuit of beauty in difficulty creates genuine tension, with micro-choices (sacrificing his queen) revealing values under pressure. The translucent opponent manifesting with "losing positions from forgotten wars" provides compelling secondary pressure. Minor deduction for the worry stone's transformation feeling slightly convenient rather than fully earned through embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based escalation through the chess game mirroring moral balance via magnetic pulls. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as Tomas's worry stone smooths—symbolizing his transformed relationship to difficulty—and "Your covenant is no longer eclipsed" reweights his exile. The closure's "hopeful melancholy guiding each step" crystallizes his new stance with visible cost in his continued wandering.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—stakes nudging based on greed versus grace directly shapes Tomas's tactical decisions. Strong sensory hierarchy with "whispering magnets instead of birds" and the eclipse creating "an eclipsed covenant of shadows." The valley's moral-physical equilibrium mechanism elevates setting beyond description to active pressure on choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each chess move correlates to moral weight via magnetic pulls, with the queen sacrifice representing peak agency. The dominant stake—redeeming exile through discovering beauty in difficulty—tightens as the game reopens his banishment wound while promising closure. Cost is legible in his final state: peaceful but still exiled, teaching what he learned rather than returning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the chess-as-moral-balance metaphor, with "Beauty dwelt where forces opposed yet listened" arising from dramatized discovery rather than assertion. The polished worry stone's transformation from dented to smooth embodies the theme of beautifying difficulty into calm. The ending's "hopeful melancholy" perfectly captures complexity without false resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through chess metaphors filtering everything ("forgotten checkmate," "cautious king crossing open squares"). Voice maintains controlled elevation appropriate to Tomas's erudition while varying rhythm under pressure. Deduction for occasional register drift into overly abstract phrasing ("forging an eclipsed covenant of shadows") that slightly exceeds the established voice's range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "chalk squares on wagon doors" and "sparrows stopped debating the wind." However, some overwriting appears in peak beats ("hopeful melancholy flooded Tomas") and template constructions ("He felt certain... though no opponent approached"). Minor scaffold in explaining the "translating silence" concept rather than purely demonstrating it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus as moral-physical equilibrium detector offers fresh transformation of the chess-as-life metaphor. The ghostly opponent containing "losing positions from forgotten wars" provides non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens resonance without sacrificing clarity, though some elements feel slightly over-determined.</comment>
