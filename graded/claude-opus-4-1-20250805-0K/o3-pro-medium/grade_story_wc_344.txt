<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Selene's motivation to repair broken mechanisms deepens through concrete embodied details—the gears rattling in her pockets, the crystal pendulum shaped like a frozen tear. Her internal conflict between fixing and inviting things to breathe again earns the final renunciation of mere repair. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("longing to learn the rhythm") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (mirrors yielding secrets, prophecy fragments forming a mechanical rose) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Selene transforms from locksmith-repairer to one who invites stilled things to breathe. The crystal heart's integration into the clock mechanism creates visible cost through the tears that thaw frost from her cheeks. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen library's mirrors and ice shelving constrain Selene's path—she must navigate reflections that confess failures to find the crystal heart. Sensory details (breath ghosting like pale ribbons, memories smelling faintly of salt) are vivid and POV-filtered. The environment directly shapes the final choice when mirrors angle their light into the mechanism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: climbing frost-stung stairs, discovering mirrors instead of books, assembling prophecy fragments, confronting painful reflections. The dominant stake (learning repair's true rhythm) tightens when Selene must apologize to her most painful mirror to receive the crystal heart, foreclosing her path as mere fixer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the mechanical rose pattern and crystal heart assembly—repair as invitation rather than fixing. The final image of Selene descending with "footsteps keeping time to a music only she and the mirrors knew" offers a non-literal answer about transformation versus restoration. The rhythm metaphor avoids stating its moral while charging all prior mechanical imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("keeper of keys that shimmered only when shadows devoured moons"). POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature—Selene notices mechanical details and rhythms others would miss. Minor compression in emotional peaks ("tears warmed her cheeks") stays within voice texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"Icicles hung like punctuation" establishes setting while suggesting the library's grammatical nature. No loops or scaffolding, strong syntactic variety. Every image advances either atmosphere or Selene's transformation. Clean propulsion through varied sentence lengths that breathe with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lunar-eclipse locksmith premise and frozen library of mirrors create a fresh synthesis—mechanical repair meets emotional reckoning through reflected failures. The prophecy-as-mechanical-rose and crystal-heart-as-pendulum transform familiar quest elements. Risk-taking with the lyric accumulative structure heightens resonance without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
