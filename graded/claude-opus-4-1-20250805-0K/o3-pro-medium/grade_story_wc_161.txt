<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marietta's internal contradiction between preserving trust and self-protection drives genuine tension, particularly in "Trust, she realized, is not a ledger column you can keep perfectly balanced; it is the moment you release the bird anyway." The transformation from isolation to risk-taking is earned through concrete stakes (the meteorite's song, the graduate's plea), though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("blooming withering through every town").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant closure—Marietta releases the bird carrying both meteorite and trust, accepting vulnerability. The cost is legible in "letting old names curl into smoke" and the risk of "repeating old tragedies." Who/where/when anchored early (bookshop attic, Marietta, late spring), and the pattern of dust-to-music-to-flight builds coherently to the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The attic setting constrains and enables choices—the skylight becomes portal for both dust patterns and bird release, while the "tiny aerodrome" along rafters creates specific spatial pressure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("lavender straw," "dust danced," "gray snow"), though some descriptions tend toward the abstract ("blooming withering beauty").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from self-preservation through accepting the meteorite to finally risking exposure by sending it out—each step narrows Marietta's options. The tension between safety and purpose deepens through "She hesitated until she remembered the graduate's trembling plea," with clear cost in potentially "repeating old tragedies."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of paper trails transforming from evidence of betrayal to "map[ping] becoming." The final image of Marietta breathing "mingling with the settling motes" while feeling "both bloom and wither, perfectly in balance" offers a non-literal answer about trust requiring acceptance of vulnerability without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm, particularly in "Rows of wicker huts lined with lavender straw offered her new flock a perfumed runway into sky." Some passages drift toward elevated register ("exile stalked her, blooming withering"), but the perceptual signature remains consistent in tracking dust, light, and movement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though several instances of abstract phrasing dilute immediacy ("blooming withering" appears twice, "becoming" as abstraction). Strong moments like "Trust shattered like cheap glass" and "Ash settled like gray snow over unused cages" demonstrate concrete imagery, but occasional overwriting ("perfumed runway into sky") reduces momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courier pigeons, Mars meteorite, and trust creates unexpected coherence—the notion of interplanetary songs carried by birds across embargoed borders feels earned. The transformation of paper trails from evidence to art shows genuine ingenuity, though some metaphorical connections strain slightly (dust motes as musical notes).</comment>
