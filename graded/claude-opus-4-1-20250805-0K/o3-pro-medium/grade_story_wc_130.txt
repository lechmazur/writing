Looking at this story through an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds meaning through patterns of dripping, equations, and rhythmic cycles rather than causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eridian's motivation to mathematize grief is embodied through concrete actions—kneeling, placing glass eyes, translating symbols to music. His acceptance that "loss does not subtract; it hovers" represents earned endurance with visible cost. The interior contradiction between measuring and accepting unmeasurable loss drives authentic choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Eridian transforms ambiguous loss from "yawning wound to measurable curve," accepting continuation over resolution. The cost is visible in his permanent offering of the glass eyes and whispered theorem to absence. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through layered symbols, drips, and musical patterns that reweight grief.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cavern orchard actively constrains and enables discovery—stalactite drips become metronomes, pomegranate glow reveals equations, the mosaic requires physical kneeling to decode. Setting elements directly shape Eridian's method of understanding. The environment functions as both laboratory and embodiment of his emotional state.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through pattern intensification: from passive observation to active kneeling, from scattered symbols to coherent sequence, from wound to "measurable curve." The stakes deepen when Eridian realizes emotion needs "continuing function" not resolution. Cost appears in his permanent sacrifice of the glass eyes and acceptance of limited sunrise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that grief requires rhythm not closure, embodied in Hope Fractions and continuing functions. The final image of equations sounding "like lullabies when solved by listening" offers resonant answer without stating moral. Subtext operates through the mosaic's "two hands almost touching yet unable to clasp."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical precision with mathematical/musical diction that reflects Eridian's perceptual signature. Phrases like "pocket hearths" and "Hope Fractions" show distinctive texture. Some elevated passages ("optimism remained buried, like a lamp under soil") occasionally drift from the established register but serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The fruit pulsed quietly, like pocket hearths" establishes setting, atmosphere, and emotional state simultaneously. Some abstract passages ("ambiguous loss lacked resolution") could be more embodied. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm support the accumulative structure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of mathematical grief-mapping through botanical rhythms offers genuine freshness. The specific invention of "Hope Fractions" and equations that sound like lullabies transforms familiar loss narratives. Risk-taking in the lyrical, non-plot-driven structure heightens emotional resonance while maintaining clarity.</comment>
