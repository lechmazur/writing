<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orin's "quietly deliberate" nature manifests through concrete micro-choices (pricking thumb on key rather than stone, proposing trust as ink) that reveal character under pressure. The rivalry with Vela creates genuine tension through contradictory impulses—scholarly ambition versus being used—though some interiority relies on abstractions ("equations settle inside his chest like birds"). The final transformation from rivalry to collaboration is earned through visible cost (temporal exile threat) and embodied choice (merged blood droplets).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure: the scholars transform from rivals to collaborators through the shared sigil, with visible cost (blood, near-exile) and foreclosed path (exploitation of shadows). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered imagery (mirrors, loops, shadows) that reweight at closure. Minor orientation wobble with "after spoons bend reality" timeline marker, but who/where/when anchors land early enough.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory's physical elements—clockwork key teeth meshing with stone sockets, rotating chamber, mirrored arcs—directly constrain choices and enable the central transformation. The shadow archive as negative space ("silhouettes cataloged by size and sorrow") charges the final decision with specificity. Setting actively participates through "obsidian tiles etched with orrery lines" and the corridor of reframed time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from scholarly discovery to survival when "temporal wind pinned her movements into recursive stutters" and the key "jittered dangerously, threatening permanent exile." The reversal—Orin closing the "wrong" loop to protect rather than exploit—narrows options to mutual trust or permanent exile. Cost is visible through blood sacrifice and the near-loss in the temporal corridor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the loop metaphor ("circles cancel sins of straight lines") paid off when choosing protection over exploitation. The shadow archive as refuge for "dimension stolen at noon" creates resonance without stating morals. The final image of scholars "wondering what other sealed awakenings awaited" reweights the opening's promise through earned humility rather than conquest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through specialized diction ("sealed awakenings," "runecrafters," "living ink") and controlled rhythm that accelerates during the corridor sequence. Some register elevation strains POV credibility ("equations settle inside his chest like birds finding roost"). Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("Only living ink can complete the mirrored loop" reveals Vela's manipulation).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Several figurative reaches strain clarity ("equations settle inside his chest like birds finding roost," "temporal wind," "film strip"). Template phrasing appears ("Orin hesitated, weighing scholarly ambition"). However, strong propulsion through the corridor sequence and precise technical language ("clockwork automaton key," "brass teeth quiet yet hungry") maintain momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rune scholarship with temporal mechanics creates non-obvious stakes (shadows as refugees from noon). The reversal—protecting rather than exploiting discovery—transforms the treasure-hunt template through specific moral calculus. Risk-taking with the loop concept and shadow archive pays off in the charged final wondering about future "sealed awakenings."</comment>
