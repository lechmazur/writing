<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cyril's motivation to "defy scheduled despair" through "serious playfulness" is consistent and embodied through concrete actions like his walking chant and firework deployment. The princess's characterization remains thin, appearing only at the end without developed interiority. Cyril's internal state shows some complexity ("felt the gravity of hopelessness slacken by a thread") but relies on abstract descriptors rather than embodied contradiction in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the final uprising, where "gravity had always been an opinion; tonight, it was officially outvoted" serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The progression from solitary infiltration to collective rebellion tracks clearly. Who/where/when anchors establish by line 2. The cost of defying authority is implied through the uprising but could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fortress setting actively shapes Cyril's tactics—he must navigate guards, use forgotten props like the fire spinner's knot, and decode the mosaic message. Sensory details like "fingers smelling faintly of black powder" and "petals drifted like colored snow" create atmosphere while advancing action. The setting constrains choices through guard positions and architectural features that Cyril must work around.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of overcoming "the gravity of hopelessness" escalates from personal defiance to collective uprising. Pressure builds through Cyril's infiltration, the guard's discovery, and the spreading rebellion. The transformation from "starless hush" to "temporary galaxies" marks meaningful deepening. Cost remains somewhat abstract—the rebellion succeeds without visible sacrifice or trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of defiance-as-festival emerges through the concrete transformation of a fortress from suppression to celebration. The mosaic's hidden message "Rise when roses fall" gains resonance when fulfilled literally. The final image of Cyril chanting "to keep his own hope airborne" while gravity is "officially outvoted" offers a non-literal answer to defeating despair through collective playfulness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a lyrical register with controlled imagery ("Petals of night-bloom roses climbed the battlements like silent audiences"). POV remains stable with Cyril throughout. Some phrases feel overwrought ("combustive dreams," "clandestine players") without clear voice motivation. The princess's brief appearance lacks distinct voice, though her understanding of "absence" suggests depth.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows moments of strong imagery but suffers from overwriting in places: "fingers smelling faintly of black powder" works well, but "the gravity of hopelessness slacken by a thread" feels abstract. Some template phrasing appears ("Cyril smiled," "Cyril laughed," "Cyril heard"). The final line about gravity being "officially outvoted" lands effectively. Several instances of elevated diction ("combustive dreams," "ambient awareness") create register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of a wandering fireworks designer infiltrating a fortress to spark rebellion through pyrotechnic poetry offers freshness. The transformation of military architecture into a festival space and the literalization of "gravity" as both physical and emotional force show ingenuity. Some elements feel familiar (princess locked in protocol, guards converted by poetry), limiting higher scores.</comment>
