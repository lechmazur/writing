I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal chains, culminating in Marrow's transformation into a permanent steward.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marrow's motivation crystallizes through embodied details—"patchwork seams as compass lines," tears that make the machine recalculate. Her choice to remain as steward rather than flee shows contradictory impulses resolved with visible cost: "grafting new plates to her shoulders, reinforcing joints with comet wire."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Marrow becoming "a stitched atlas glowing with other people's returned light," with clear cost in her permanent transformation. The accumulative structure coheres as midnight calls teach her to build the apparatus that enables reverse migration. However, the conceptual mechanism of "reverse migration" remains somewhat abstract despite vivid imagery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint—the failing hydraulics' blood powers the tower, the disconnected telephone that "should not have been able to ring" initiates everything. The censer foot's transformation from "greened by years of unburned incense" to "glowing softly, releasing no incense yet perfuming the air" charges the final configuration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: first cryptic lessons, then scavenging and building, finally the choice between departure and stewardship. The cost manifests in Marrow's physical transformation and isolation: "Night after night, under moons waxing and waning, her sense of self fluctuates."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of reverse migration—"rivers that flow back to their glaciers"—as a way to navigate grief. The final image of Marrow as "a stitched atlas glowing with other people's returned light" offers resonant answer without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled compression: "Silence lingered...broken only by the low wheeze of cooling metal." The perceptual signature stays distinct through selective noticing of mechanical and celestial details, though occasional phrases like "raw solace" feel slightly overwrought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong imagery but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without always advancing pressure. Some phrases feel overwrought: "grieving breath," "rouge and eager to move again." The paraphrase loop in "her sense of self fluctuates with moon phases" echoes the earlier identical phrase.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of navigation equipment with spiritual apparatus (censer foot on gyroscope) creates fresh specificity. The concept of reverse migration as grief navigation offers a non-obvious angle, though execution occasionally relies on abstract phrasing rather than embodied detail.</comment>
