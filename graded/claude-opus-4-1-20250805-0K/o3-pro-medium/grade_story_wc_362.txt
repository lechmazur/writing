<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ilara's motivation to prove objects absorb emotions drives concrete actions through the prism ritual, with embodied sensory work ("breath clouding," "toes gripping the quartz"). The sailor's shame and lovers' joy create layered emotional states that inform her final understanding about responsibility. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("intimate with borrowed guilt") but the closure choice to carry both proof and responsibility shows clear cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through frost patterns, prism memories, and sensory accumulation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Ilara understands objects transform emotions "like soil absorbs rain." The cost appears in "whoever next touched the prism might inherit storms not meant for them." Orientation anchors clearly (mystic, arbor, predawn). Deduction for slight ambiguity in how the "proof" will translate to the skeptical guild.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frost patterns on the car window constrain Ilara's method of reading memories, requiring "respectful attention" and physical contact. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("wet crystal struck by a tuning fork," "briny heartbeats"). The quartz arbor and abandoned sedan create a liminal space between natural and artificial that supports the theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: first the sailor's shame, then lovers' joy, creating an "emotional tide swing" that tests Ilara's grounding. The dominant stake (proving objects absorb emotions) tightens when she realizes the peril of inherited storms. Cost is legible but could be more visceral in the moment of realization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of objects as emotional repositories, culminating in "soil absorbs rain" - transformation rather than storage. The final image of the lantern "swinging somewhere far inside the stone" offers resonant ambiguity about memory's persistence. Strong subtext in "truthful lies" and "trustworthy ambivalence" avoids stating the moral directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("Mist curled like hesitant ghosts," "stitches reality back together"). POV remains stable with Ilara's mystical perception filtering observations. Some elevated diction ("cartography glinted," "harmonic between sorrow") fits the mystic character but occasionally strains. Strong perceptual signature in how she reads frost patterns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations and strong imagery. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("helixes across the frost that iced") and some abstract phrasing ("intimacy of borrowed guilt"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. The "truthful lies" paradox works but risks feeling templated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on psychometry through the lighthouse prism storing maritime emotions. The specific synthesis of frost-reading with object memory feels earned. The "truthful lies" concept and objects' "trustworthy ambivalence" offer non-obvious moral complexity. Some familiar mystical elements but transformed through specific sensory work.</comment>
