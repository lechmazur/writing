<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prophet's precognitive forgetfulness creates genuine internal contradiction, with his forgetting moments after prophesying driving meaningful choices. The narrator's progression from frustration to acceptance ("opened my ears wider than my doubts") shows earned change through concrete experience with the chalk and recording attempts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through repeated driftwood arrangements and layered forgetting. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the narrator accepts that "the true recording was never meant for magnetic tape but for marrow," with visible cost in following echoes despite their uncertainty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden constrains navigation and perception throughout, with statues vibrating to release "notes too weathered to be music yet too deliberate to be noise." Sensory hierarchy reflects the narrator's obsession with capturing sound, while the prophet's driftwood arrangements create lived-in spatial choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: failed recording attempt, chalk spiral's temporary success, then acceptance of recording in "marrow" rather than tape. The prophet's forgetting creates coherent pressure that forces the narrator's stance shift from technological capture to embodied acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "clinging to echoes" as reliable cartography for unmappable memory. The final realization that recording happens in marrow rather than tape offers a non-literal answer to capturing aging, with the recurring chalk and driftwood charging this insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("Low tide delivered me," "locally famous for predictions he forgot"). The prophet's speech carries authentic indirection ("Keep this, because you will forget why you need it"), while sensory perception filters through sound-obsession consistently.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Some template cadence in middle sections ("He was...," "He looked up...," "He gathered...") and occasional register elevation ("devotional medals," "tidal longing"). However, strong opening/closing lines and purposeful compression in key beats maintain momentum despite these artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The precognitively forgetful prophet who arranges driftwood to navigate by echo-footprints offers genuine freshness. The specific synthesis of memory-loss with prophecy, combined with the fog garden setting, creates an inevitable-feeling world logic that serves the aging theme uniquely.</comment>
