I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through lyric density and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to learn the language of buildings is embodied through concrete actions (renting the attic, weekly tea sessions), and contradictory impulses operate simultaneously (maintaining "agreed upon lies" while desperately seeking truth). The final acceptance of Selin's lessons shows earned transformation with visible cost—the weight of owing stories to expectant rooftops.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of the narrator alone among "thyme and broken porcelain, rehearsing the syllables of sorrowful masonry," with every rooftop now "expectant." The cost is legible: inheriting both Selin's unfinished work and the burden of translation between worlds. The accumulative structure coheres as revelations about Mrs. Polina and Selin reweight all prior tea sessions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rooftop garden functions as more than setting—it's the liminal space where languages converge, constraining all interactions to this charged threshold. Sensory details like "tepid conversation," "fragrant with mint," and "waterlogged voice" are filtered through the narrator's learning perspective. The seal's physical degradation ("crack ran through the seal") directly precipitates the climactic revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: from learning brick words to mastering the First Lie's glyphs, culminating in the weight of carrying lessons "somewhere the bricks could not reach." The cost manifests physically as Selin flickers and fades with each lesson. The revelation about murder reweights all prior interactions, though the final burden could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of translation—between sky and brick, living and dead, truth and agreed-upon lies. The final image of rehearsing "syllables of sorrowful masonry" offers a non-literal answer about the burden of carrying others' untranslatable histories. The murder revelation transforms the tea sessions into a resonant exploration of penance and incomplete communication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "falling sparks stitched silver syllables," "squeaking phonemes," "guttural limestone vowels." The narrative voice maintains consistent lyric compression while modulating intensity (compare the controlled opening to the urgent "walls replied in panic"). Dialogue carries subtext effectively, especially Selin's "Death merely freed her schedule."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "pale as plaster yet with patiently nimble fingers that arranged teacups like punctuation marks" characterizes while advancing the language metaphor. Some figurative density in places ("resonant half truths" appears twice), but the prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of learning architectural languages through a dead tutor transforms familiar ghost-story elements through specific detail (the brass seal, cuneiform spirals, "First Lie Agreed Upon"). The murder revelation between teacher and landlady, bound in a garden "like cracked pots wired with gold," offers genuine surprise that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
