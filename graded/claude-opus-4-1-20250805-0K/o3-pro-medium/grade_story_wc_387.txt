<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hai-rin's characterization succeeds through his philosophical attention to hidden patterns and effort, with embodied moments like kneeling on wet stone and studying foam spirals. The final reflection on hidden effort glowing "brighter than any lantern" earns the closure through prior causality. Minor deduction for some abstract philosophical musings that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns, reflections, and observations build toward the resonant reconfiguration where "The sky is changing because we are listening." Cost is conceptual but legible in the straining arms and the care not to lose droplets. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the central conflict lacking concrete stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices effectively—the wet parapet, moonlit stairs, and harbor tidewall all shape actions. The net stretched on water becomes the crucial tool for reading moon patterns. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, from "glossy and murmurous" stones to fireflies painting faces in "scintillatingly somber radiance."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake of understanding Cang-E's wandering moon path deepens through the net-on-water solution, with visible cost in the straining arms. However, the conflict lacks urgency—why does this moon shift matter beyond intellectual curiosity? The piece needed higher concrete stakes to fully earn its philosophical closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the recurring motif of hidden patterns and effort, from net-mending to moon paths to firefly labor. The final image of gathering the damp net "careful not to lose a single droplet" resonantly answers the central question about appreciating hidden effort without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent philosophical register with distinct perceptual signature—Hai-rin notices patterns in water veins, firefly brevity, foam spirals. Dialogue between Hai-rin and Zhen feels natural with appropriate subtext. Minor deduction for occasional drift into elevated diction that slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery, though some passages lean toward overwriting ("embroidered the courtyard air with pinpricks of green gold"). Information density is generally high. Deductions for elevated register in places ("murmurous," "scintillatingly somber radiance") and occasional abstract philosophizing that could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The piece offers a fresh synthesis of astronomy, net-mending philosophy, and moon-maiden mythology. The specific solution of using nets on water to read celestial patterns feels earned and non-obvious. The philosophical stance on hidden effort provides genuine insight, though the piece plays somewhat safe in its literary fiction mode.</comment>
