I'll evaluate this story through the lens of literary excellence, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This story operates primarily under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens with hybrid elements. The narrative builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal chains, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Wren's weaving creates a new path "from ruin to reverence."

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Wren's motivation as a "poetic wharf weaver" who breaks precedents is clearly established and consistent throughout. Her internal drive manifests through concrete actions like gathering shards and weaving hybrid instruments, with the blood-prick moment providing embodied cost. The character lacks deeper internal contradiction or complexity that would elevate beyond competent execution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Wren's weaving creates a literal "thoroughfare spiraling outward" that transforms the labyrinth from exclusive space to accessible path. The blood-drop represents visible cost, and the accumulative structure coheres through the weaving metaphor. Minor deduction for slightly mechanical resolution in the final beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting actively constrains and enables choices throughout—walls shift, corridors slide "like drawers," and the Reverence Spindle chamber provides the crucial loom. Sensory details like "iron dust and evaporated brine" mixed with "phantom orchids" create atmospheric specificity that supports the journey from ruin to reverence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on transforming the labyrinth from exclusive to inclusive space, with Wren's blood serving as literal cost. The pressure builds through accumulative imagery rather than reversals, appropriate to the textural lens. The labyrinth's responsive shifting provides complication, though agency sometimes feels predetermined rather than contested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of transformation through broken precedents emerges organically through concrete actions—sewing shards into hybrid instruments, weaving new paths from old threads. The final image of the thoroughfare "walkable by any who seek reverence" resonantly answers the thematic question without explicit moralizing, though some passages edge toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Wren's poetic nature, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "barnacle shells crack like distant clocks." Some passages achieve genuine beauty, though occasional overwriting appears ("hauntingly optimistic heart beats like a gull's wing just above silence"). No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of overwriting diminish momentum—"orchid solace" appears three times, and metaphorical density occasionally obscures clarity. The "sleepwalking paths" construction repeats without clear payoff. Information density is high but sometimes tips into purple prose territory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of weaving craft with labyrinth navigation offers fresh perspective on the transformation narrative. The specific detail of "hybrid instruments" sewn from broken precedents shows originality. However, the mystical journey structure and some imagery ("lighthouse-bright spirit") lean on familiar templates without full transformation.</comment>
