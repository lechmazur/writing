<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysandra's empathetically decisive nature drives concrete choices throughout—she "never ignored a plea" and acts on the elevator's multilingual cries. Her internal motivation to "construct bridges from silos" manifests in specific actions like removing the clock weight and using languages as healing tools. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in emotional states ("vigorous tender resolve blossomed") rather than fully embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—the valley discovers "bridges where grain once divided" through accumulated linguistic and musical healing. The cost is visible: the clock tower sacrifices its weight, adapting "new syncopation" for unity. Causality holds as Lysandra's recognition of the elevator's "counterpoint" pattern leads to systematic rehabilitation through multilingual song.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower and grain elevator function as characters themselves, with brass orreries tracing unseen planets and the elevator speaking in multilingual fragments. Setting constrains choice when Lysandra must borrow the cuckoo clock weight, knowing it will "cripple a minor bell." The valley's physical geography enables the sonic bridge between structures.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from hearing the elevator's plea to sacrificing the clock's functionality for a "greater voice." The dominant stake—healing isolation through connection—tightens when Lysandra must choose between preserving the clock's precision and enabling communication. Cost is legible: "Unity outweighed precision, and both structures understood the trade."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of using multiple languages as "rivets" to repair both structure and isolation. The final image of the elevator humming "gracias, merci, thanks" while the valley discovers bridges resonates without stating a moral. The concept of borrowed starlight frames temporal limits that create urgency for connection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical precision—"the astronomical clock tower breathed like a giant lung" establishes immediate texture. POV remains controlled with Lysandra's musical perception filtering everything ("cataloged melodies instead of books"). The multilingual dialogue serves as action, each language choice deliberate in the healing process.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"Cool night wind combed through reeds, ferrying the elevator's hoarse syllables." Some elevated diction occasionally drifts from character register ("empathetically decisive finger traced"), and a few abstract constructions ("vigorous tender resolve blossomed") could be more concrete. No loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musical librarianship with architectural rehabilitation creates an inevitable-feeling system where buildings sing and languages become construction materials. The concept of "borrowed starlight" as a temporal constraint adds originality. Risk-taking in making inanimate structures into chorus members heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>
