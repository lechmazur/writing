<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mina's motivation to protect rather than exploit drives clear choices under pressure, with her "fingers danced, encoded with the same ethereal grit" showing embodied determination. The internal conflict between trusting Calvin versus acting alone creates genuine tension, though Calvin's one-note opportunism lacks nuance. The final choice to invert the tricksters' signal shows earned agency with visible cost in Calvin's defeat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal lens with Mina decoding warnings, recognizing the threat, countering Calvin's exploitation, and broadcasting peace frequencies—each beat advancing through because/therefore logic. The closure lands as a Decisive Change when Mina's counter-signal transforms campus division into unity, with cost visible in Calvin's neutralization and the tricksters' retreat. The orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The radio booth's "glowing meters," "blinking red LEDs like candles in a crypt," and subsonic frequencies create a vivid sensory environment that enables Mina's solution. The campus protests and amphitheater's subwoofers function as more than backdrop—they're resources Mina exploits. However, the university setting could be more specifically rendered beyond generic "quad stone paths."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing cosmic exploitation of human division—escalates from signal detection through Calvin's betrayal to Mina's counter-broadcast, with each beat narrowing options. Calvin's power play forces Mina's decisive action, and the cost lands visibly when she sacrifices potential "global recognition" to protect humanity. The tricksters' retreat confirms the stakes were real.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of unity versus exploitation emerges through concrete action rather than statement, with the tricksters who "thrived on divided planets" countered by Mina's harmonizing frequencies. The final image of auroras "tying their divided stories together" resonates without moralizing. However, the theme could deepen beyond the somewhat binary opposition of division/unity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent close-third POV with distinctive perceptual signatures like "Static snow hissed...trembling like distant stardust." Dialogue between Mina and Calvin carries subtext effectively, with Calvin's "voice silk over steel" revealing character. Some phrases like "ethereal grit" and "orphaned childhood nights" feel slightly overwritten but don't break voice coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments like "each pulse hiding something sharp beneath its music" but suffers from occasional overwriting ("tattered astronomical charts...like candles in a crypt"). Some template phrasing appears ("Mina exhaled, cautiously hopeful") and the line about community divides appears twice nearly verbatim. Information density is generally good with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a radio DJ decoding cosmic warnings through constellation signals offers a fresh angle on invasion narratives. The specific synthesis of subsonic frequencies, campus protests, and festival equipment creates an inventive solution. The transformation of potential exploitation into protection through sound engineering feels earned, though the trickster mythology could be more specifically developed.</comment>
