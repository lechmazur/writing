I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece. The story builds through layered sensory details (whale-song, moonlight, tile patterns) and memory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where skepticism and wonder merge.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Soraya's internal contradiction between skepticism and obligation to her mentor creates genuine tension. The transformation from skeptic to someone who carries "both skepticism and wonder like matched lenses" is earned through concrete experience with the tile's memories. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("sculpt space for reflection") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Soraya's worldview shifts to embrace both skepticism and wonder, with visible cost (tears for mentor, accepting his burden). The accumulative lens holds throughout as sensory details and memories layer toward this transformation. Slight deduction for predictable arc from skeptic to believer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tower setting actively constrains choice (isolation forces confrontation with the tile) and the whale migration creates temporal pressure. Sensory details are selective and purposeful - "salt wind raked," "moon plating its back like armor." The tile functions as micro-setting that drives the central transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative deepening - from touching the tile to receiving visions to understanding her mentor's true motivation. The cost is legible (accepting responsibility for others' grief, carrying forward mentor's burden). One meaningful deepening that changes Soraya's knowledge and stance, appropriate for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the synthesis of skepticism and wonder without explicit moralizing. The concept of "entangled memories" works both literally (quantum particles) and metaphorically (shared human experience). The final image of carrying "matched lenses" offers a non-literal answer to whether mysticism has value.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with appropriate modulation as Soraya moves from skeptical observation to emotional revelation. Some elevated diction ("sympathetic skeptic by reputation") fits the contemplative tone. Minor issues with occasional filter verbs and somewhat uniform syntax in descriptive passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm shifts between contemplative and active moments. Some repetitive phrasing ("entangled memories" appears multiple times without variation) and occasional overwriting ("moon plating its back like armor"). Information density is good - most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The magic tile premise is somewhat familiar, but the specific synthesis of whale migration, quantum entanglement metaphor, and grief counseling creates a fresh angle. The transformation from skeptic to believer follows expected beats. Strongest originality in linking whale-song to human memory through the tile's mechanism.</comment>
