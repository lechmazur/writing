<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" who reads houses through displaced objects is distinctive and drives every choice. Her internal experience is embodied through physical responses ("pulse slowed," "brushing her fingers") and the final choice to sanctify demonstrates earned agency with visible cost. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract "inadvertently profound" moment that briefly slips into self-awareness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the house transforms from "merely listening" to "quickening breath" with visible cost in the wishbone offering and paint chips realigning. The piece teaches its displacement method early and pays it off when Mara's ritual awakens the house. Slight deduction for the abstract "loneliness can carve deeper than knives" which momentarily breaks the otherwise grounded causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint—the orris root releases scent only "when truth exhaled," the porcelain swan's placement matters spatially, and environmental details like "paint chips...aligning themselves into delicate scales" charge the final transformation. The micro-setting of displaced objects constrains Mara's choices throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: silence→dust swirls→sawdust exhales→tremor→warmth seeps, with the wishbone arrival marking the decisive deepening. The cost is visible in the house's transformation from mute to breathing. Minor deduction as the middle section could tighten slightly between object placements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of displacement/placement as illness/cure, with the final image of the door closing "as lungs returning to repose" offering a non-literal answer about how spaces hold memory. The orris root and wishbone work as earned symbols that constrain choice rather than decorative motifs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature in phrases like "threshold-taste in the light" and "silence stood like a cathedral pillar." Voice maintains lyric compression throughout with controlled rhythm shifts from contemplative to urgent during the sanctification. Minor deduction for "inadvertently profound and startled by her own words" which briefly breaks the otherwise consistent register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Paint peeled in scrolls, yet the windows shone with wiped intention"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful figurative language that serves the accumulative mode. Deductions for the abstract "loneliness can carve deeper than knives" and slight overwriting in "hushed blaze licking the timbers."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of reading houses through displaced objects offers a genuinely fresh angle on haunted house territory. The specific synthesis of perfumer's root as compass needle, objects as diagnostic tools, and houses as mute rather than lonely transforms familiar material. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens coherence (+0.3).</comment>
