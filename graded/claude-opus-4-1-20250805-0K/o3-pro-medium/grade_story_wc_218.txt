<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—transforming the orchard before death to foster interspecies communication—drives consistent, escalating choices with embodied detail ("salt crust on skin," "Death's deadline freed her"). The final renunciation (accepting death while completing the circuit) carries visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in middle beats ("architectural secrets older than masonry").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through copper-wiring sequences toward Mara's final integration into the island's "endless breathing"—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (her death enabling the network). The piece teaches its pattern early through systematic botanical documentation and pays off with the communal listening scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The temple orchard's living architecture ("roots ribbed its colonnades") and copper-wire network constrain Mara's methods and enable the final interspecies connection. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("sun-focused lens," "cedar-scented acceptance"). The setting literally becomes the mechanism for closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (six months to live) through systematic wire installation to communal revelation, with each stage narrowing Mara's time while expanding the network's reach. The priest's touch of the wire marks a key tightening. Cost is visible in Mara's declining energy ("Sleep now came in translucent slivers") paid against the completed circuit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—the wiring creates literal connection that reveals "root, reef, and rib cage shared identical branching math." The final image of Mara's pulse grafted to the island's breathing offers a non-literal answer about interconnection without moralizing. The children adding "cracked shells and plastic bottles" to the species inventory shows inclusive complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent POV with distinctive perceptual signature ("sand grains from decades of patrols," "brazen calm"). Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("colonnades," "clerestory slits") slightly exceeds Mara's established lexicon. Dialogue (priest's blessing) functions effectively when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("Death's deadline freed her") but suffers from occasional density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences during the wire-installation sequence without clear payoff. Template cadence emerges in "She gathered...She wired...She felt" progression. Information density is generally high with purposeful detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of using copper wire to create interspecies communication network offers fresh angle on ecological connection. Specific details (sun-focused lens for soldering, dolphins synchronizing clicks) avoid generic treatment. The transformation of a temple into a living communication system shows genuine originality, though some elements feel slightly familiar.</comment>
