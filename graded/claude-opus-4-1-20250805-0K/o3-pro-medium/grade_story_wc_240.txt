I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between safety and surrender drives authentic choices, with her physics background creating genuine tension against her current role. The duplicate-self encounter forces contradictory impulses to act simultaneously in scene. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract resolution of "letting go" that could use more embodied specificity in the final beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through spore imagery and permeable barriers building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara transforms from detector to welcomer. The cost is legible in "some doors secure the world by opening" - she sacrifices her protective stance. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, though the duplicate's arrival feels slightly convenient despite thematic justification.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bioluminescent farm creates genuine constraints - permeable barriers, spore clouds, and cap light shape Mara's movements and choices. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout, with the barrier crossing as pivotal threshold. The glowing environment mirrors internal states without heavy-handed symbolism, particularly in "caps tilting to form corridors."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from security breach to existential choice about surrender versus safety. The barrier crossing represents meaningful deepening that forecloses her old path. Cost appears in abandoning her protective role, though the duplicate's arrival lacks sufficient pressure buildup for higher scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the physics of letting go and permeable barriers without explicit moralizing. The final "welcome" in spores and transformed security system offers resonant answer to the central question. Strong subtext in the laser pointer as both toy and compass, reweighting from control to invitation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Mara's spatial mapping and scientific framing ("folding space like origami"). Voice modulates effectively under pressure, though the duplicate's everywhere/nowhere speech briefly strains POV boundaries. Clean free indirect style maintains consistency through emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though "quiet wildfire" appears twice as descriptor. Information density high in descriptive passages. Minor template cadence in "She [verb], [verb-ing]" pattern in middle section. The "physics of letting go" phrase risks abstraction but earns its repetition through accumulation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of security specialist encountering possibility-self in bioluminescent setting. The permeable barriers concept transforms from physical to metaphysical effectively. Risk-taking in the duplicate-self device pays off thematically, though the execution edges toward familiar self-confrontation territory.</comment>
