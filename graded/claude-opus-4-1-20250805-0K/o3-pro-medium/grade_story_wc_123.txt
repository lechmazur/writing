<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Hilara's meticulous nature and conflicted loyalty drive meaningful choices, particularly her decision to share clearance codes despite personal risk. The internal tension between preserving data integrity and institutional safety creates authentic pressure. Minor deduction for Coren's relatively thin characterization and some stock phrasing around "monkish rigor."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkage from followed→message→journey→collaboration→flood diversion. Closure lands with Decisive Change (gates open, marshes fill) and visible cost (Hilara's exposure to authorities). Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by line 3. Slight deduction for convenient timing of the supercell's arrival.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric work with "silver mist," "fountains whispering like subdued thunderheads," and the greenhouse in an overturned freight container. Setting constrains choices through surveillance cameras, maintenance arcades, and spillway gates. The quarantine zone's existence shapes tactics throughout. Some generic descriptors ("skeletal refineries") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving storm data integrity vs. institutional loyalty) established early and tightens when Hilara must choose between safety and action. The supercell creates genuine urgency with flood consequences. Cost is visible when she transmits codes knowing "the council suspected her drift." One meaningful escalation sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of integrity versus institutional control emerges through concrete actions rather than statements. The final image of "honest weather" and storms teaching mercy resonates without moralizing. "Layered tranquility" motif pays off in both the wind chimes and final tea scene. Slight deduction for the somewhat pat resolution of "mutual survival."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with meteorological precision ("storm isobars," "barometric adjustments") that stays consistent. Controlled psychic distance and clean free indirect style. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("You read the message"). Some register elevation in phrases like "monkish rigor" and "composite symphony" slightly exceeds the POV's established baseline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for scattered overwriting ("symphony of mutual survival"), some template phrasing ("She hesitated, recalling..."), and occasional register drift. No major artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorology, surveillance state, and data integrity creates non-obvious stakes. The quarantine zone housing storm-lit crops is inventive. Risk-taking in the quiet ending where tea and pigeon create resonance rather than explosive confrontation. The specific detail of "antennae made from umbrella spines" shows originality.</comment>
