<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal contradiction between seeking understanding and accepting unknowability drives authentic tension, particularly in the wire-untangling sequence where methodical analysis meets grief's chaos. The final choice to release the snow globe shows earned renunciation with visible cost ("lighter by the weight of knowing how to unclench"). Minor deduction for Death's characterization remaining somewhat abstract despite being named as a companion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery (wire knots, floating pages, snow globe) that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where understanding arrives through modeling failure rather than solving it. The mathematician's journal provides the crucial turn ("only surrender could solve for peace") that reweights the narrator's approach. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (submersible, sunken ship library).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sunken library constrains movement and discovery effectively, with swollen shelves and floating pages creating atmospheric pressure that mirrors internal state. The wire's physical properties ("branching, rejoining, looping") become essential to understanding letting go. Deduction for some generic underwater descriptions that don't leverage the specific library setting's unique constraints on choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from external discovery (Earhart) to personal quest (Jonah) to the wire's revelation about productive failure, with each layer deepening the cost of holding on. The final model of "tensions and releases" shows agency through attention rather than action. Stakes remain somewhat abstract in places, particularly Death's presence which doesn't create concrete pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the physics metaphor: knots that release tension "productively" by failing, paralleling grief's necessary surrender. The final transmission "not of distress, not of triumph, but of resignation measured in wavelengths" offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question. The snow globe's recurring presence charges the ending without forcing symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature filters everything through scientific observation ("quietly analytic patience," "equations sketched beside terse prose") while emotional undertow creates tension. Controlled modulation from clinical description to vulnerability ("feeling Jonah's absence tighten across my ribs"). Minor deduction for Death's dialogue being implied rather than distinguished, though this serves the piece's restraint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("Fame evaporates quickly at depth; pressure squeezes it into silence") but several instances of abstract telling weaken momentum. Filter constructions appear frequently ("I felt," "I imagined," "I understood") without voice justification. Some paraphrase loops around the letting go concept dilute impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underwater exploration with grief physics creates non-obvious angle on loss. The wire as physical proof of letting go transforms expected metaphor into concrete discovery. Risk-taking in the Death personification and restrained emotional register mostly succeeds, though Death's function remains somewhat template.</comment>
