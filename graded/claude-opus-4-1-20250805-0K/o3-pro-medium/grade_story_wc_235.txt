<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's jealousy of past selves drives a concrete intervention that alters the timeline, with embodied stress ("temples throb with metallic bees") and contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to write "To Be Determined" shows earned agency through causality, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic clarity ("chronologically confused") rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration: the narrator rewrites prophecy through charcoal draft, achieving "adequately footnoted" stasis with clear cost (accepting temporal paradox). The birch bark scroll's transformation from prophecy to "estranged sibling" alongside the new draft creates genuine closure, though the orientation takes slightly long to anchor the ranger role.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cabin's walls transform into peak maps and the birch bark grows from mattress springs, making setting actively constrain choices. Sensory detail ("old coffee, kerosene, and feral nostalgia") filters through POV effectively, though the mountain geography could be more precisely choreographed during the flight sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: discovering grave → finding paradoxical scroll → soaring to witness dual timelines → intervening to change fate. The jealousy-as-solvent revelation deepens stakes meaningfully, with clear cost in accepting temporal instability ("neither dead nor alive but adequately footnoted").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between linear time and paradox, with the birch bark scroll and charcoal draft as dueling texts that must coexist. The final "adequately footnoted" resolution offers a non-literal answer to chronological confusion without moralizing, though "feral nostalgia" occasionally leans toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends ranger pragmatism ("disbelief offers no calories at altitude") with lyrical compression ("memory rose inside me, not gentle, but feral"). POV remains controlled through temporal disorientation, with perceptual signature intact even during the flight sequence's heightened state.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density and varied rhythm, particularly in lines like "I folded my jealousy into a paper plane of breath." Some figurative density in peak beats ("metallic bees," "memory-starved animals") occasionally stacks without full payoff, and a few abstract constructions ("jaded wonder") could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of a ranger who chronicles impossible weather while experiencing temporal rupture feels fresh, with the birch bark scroll as both prophecy and mattress growth adding specificity. The resolution through "adequately footnoted" existence rather than heroic triumph shows genuine risk-taking that heightens thematic stakes.</comment>
