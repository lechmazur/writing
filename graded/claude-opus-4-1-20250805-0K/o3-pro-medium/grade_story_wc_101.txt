I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring an **Accumulative/Textural** drive lens based on the layered quietness, pattern of anonymous giving, and the resonant final image of echoing support.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhessa's "gently persistent purpose" manifests through concrete choices—giving the grandmother the teacher's basket without hesitation shows embodied character under pressure. The final moment where donations return "like dawn itself" earns the cyclical endurance with visible community cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through "echoes never pay customs"—the pattern of giving/receiving crystallizes with felt cost (the three missing units exactly matching the given basket). The accumulative lens holds as density builds from quiet resistance to active circulation of faith.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting that constrains choices—"patchwork barrels and rope-slung lanterns disguised as bird nests" shows occupied space under threat. The antique bell's weight and gleam become tactile anchors that "remind families of older, unbroken rituals," charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: from "children ate boiled paper" to the grandmother's empty pot to the crumpled napkin with fresh bills. The dominant stake (sustaining community under sanctions) tightens when they're "short by three units" then immediately receives anonymous replenishment, showing cyclical cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bell's circulation—"a circulation of faith more precise than clocks"—without stating morals. The final "echoes never pay customs" reweights the entire midnight run as resistance that transcends borders through recursive generosity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains "amplified quiet" through controlled understatement: "No one gasped; we had learned to exhale silently." The perceptual signature of noticing silence and weight ("Its frail chime was muted under a square of wool, yet everyone...felt it trembling") stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose density serves the accumulative mode well—"Sanctions had severed trade routes, medicines, stories, and names, but hunger stayed, gnawing politely at doors." Some filter-verb clustering ("We understood," "We hurried") slightly dulls immediacy but doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of anonymous donations cycling through a sanctioned community offers fresh specificity. "Support grows by echo, and echoes never pay customs" transforms the familiar resistance narrative through economic/spiritual fusion, though the setup follows recognizable patterns.</comment>
