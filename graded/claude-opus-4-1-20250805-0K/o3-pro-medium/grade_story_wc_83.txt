I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages from the blast through Ashraf's journey to find and neutralize the energy source.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ashraf's motivation is consistently rooted in trauma-driven purpose, with the geode serving as both physical and emotional anchor. His choice to surrender the crystal despite it being "the last light the bride he never married had chosen" shows contradictory impulses acting in scene with visible cost. The characterization avoids therapy-speak and maintains embodied emotion through "bleak exhilaration" and physical reactions to the energy wells.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Decisive Change when Ashraf sacrifices the geode to neutralize the energy node, with clear cost ("hollowed him of doubt"). The causal chain from wedding blast to energy discovery to final sacrifice maintains integrity. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, and the drive lens holds throughout without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating observatory and ravaged plains create atmospheric pressure, with the "glassy weeds whispering static" and "vortices of violet dust" providing vivid sensory detail. The geode constrains Ashraf's journey and enables the final choice. However, some setting details remain functional rather than fully integrated into character perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing continental destruction while confronting personal loss—escalates from personal journey to apocalyptic threat. The tightening occurs when Ashraf must choose between keeping his last connection to his bride and saving millions. Cost is legible in "the choice hollowed him of doubt" and the energy redistribution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of destruction birthing potential and the "unfiltered awakening" that transforms tragedy into purpose. The ending offers a non-literal answer about equilibrium between loss and forward movement. However, some thematic elements feel slightly abstracted rather than fully embodied in scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent register with purposeful compression and scientific terminology that fits the world. Ashraf's perceptual signature shows in how he experiences energy as bruises and hymns. Some passages drift toward elevated diction ("argent sheets," "lattice knots") that occasionally strains against immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the sky sang with iron." However, several instances of elevated register ("bleak exhilaration spread," "intangibly tangible") and some density issues with figurative language in high-pressure beats. The filter verb "realized" appears at a crucial moment, and there's occasional synonym churn around the energy descriptions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of wedding tragedy with quantum energy detection offers a fresh angle on survivor narratives. The specific detail of the geode as both shield and key creates organic originality. The story commits to its premise without retreating into safety, though some elements feel familiar within speculative fiction conventions.</comment>
