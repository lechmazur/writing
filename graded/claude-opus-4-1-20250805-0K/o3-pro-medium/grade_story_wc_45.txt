I'll evaluate this story systematically under the demanding editorial standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through layered imagery (bone constellations, the tooth, the heart) building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when the changeling's heart completes the constellation and restores the real child.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong character specificity with Liora's "forgiving skeptic" contradiction acting throughout (doubting yet permitting the garden's logic). Kedron's "shrewdly innocent" nature manifests in his bone-setting expertise paired with wonder. The final choice to "map new constellations from every error" shows earned transformation with visible cost (the cleft in certainty knitting closed through "earned wonder").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands when the heart completes the constellation, reversing the changeling substitution ("Somewhere a cradle creaked, a real baby stirring where the changeling had slept"). The accumulative lens holds as bone fragments, tooth, and heart layer into the constellation system. Cost is visible in the transformation's requirements and the characters' altered certainty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The garden's bone-constellation mechanism constrains every choice, from tooth placement to heart retrieval. Sensory specificity excels ("scent of milk and iron," "stairs ribbed like vertebrae"). The environment actively participates through the garden's responses, though some descriptions edge toward ornamental ("bluish fountains humming with mechanisms").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from skeptical investigation through tooth-testing to the revelation of the missing heart. Each discovery tightens options: the tooth alone fails, forcing descent to the heart chamber. The cost manifests in Liora's widening "cleft in certainty" and the physical transformation of the constellation completing only with both elements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete mechanics of "setting bones" expanding to "reset a narrative." The final image of mapping "new constellations from every error" resonates without moralizing, reweighting mistakes as navigational tools. Subtext operates through the garden's bone architecture suggesting bodies as temporary configurations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("nostalgia mixed with fresh astonishment," "every orbit, a silver tendon"). Some register elevation strains POV credibility ("the secret biology of betrayal"). Perceptual signature strong in how Liora processes through skeptical forgiveness while Kedron sees through bone-setter's eyes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density high with most sentences advancing multiple layers. Some overwriting appears ("shrewdly innocent despite eyes that had mapped every ruin in three kingdoms"). Figurative density occasionally overwhelms clarity ("every star was a polished bone fragment; every orbit, a silver tendon, singing with hidden gears"). Strong rhythm variation prevents monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The bone constellation garden offers fresh transformation of changeling mythology through mechanical/biological fusion. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure and the image system of bones-as-stars pays off. The "substitute body...with wrong bones" and the heart floating in honey show specific invention beyond template fantasy.</comment>
