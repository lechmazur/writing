<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to transform grief into healing light is clear and drives every choice, with internal contradiction between accepting loss and needing to hold Jorin's voice. The final moment where she "held her brother's voice without bleeding" shows earned change through specific struggle. However, some interior phrasing tends toward abstraction ("luminous torment," "quiet catastrophes") rather than embodied sensation, and secondary characters lack pressure beyond gatekeeping functions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery (cranes, shadows, steam) that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where mourners receive borrowed shadows and Lyra achieves painful compromise with grief. The closure lands with visible cost—tears still refract light into "sharp halos"—and the journey from crafting lanterns to releasing healing cranes traces clear causality. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Lyra, lantern maker, archipelago) though the shadow-detachment worldbuilding could ground earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating tea garden and glass basilica create vivid, constraining environments—porcelain cups on leashed clouds, koi swimming through air, stained glass refracting starlight into ladders. These settings directly shape choices: the basilica demands payment in "unspoken aches," the tea garden's steam enables Lyra's lantern release. The surreal physics remain internally consistent and the final garden transformation where shadows reunite with bodies charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming grief into healing light—escalates from personal need through basilica trial to communal healing, with each stage extracting cost (memories as payment, burned fingertips, accepting permanent sorrow). The tension deepens when Jorin appears in the recording and Lyra must fold her bruises into cranes while maintaining control. However, the acolyte's warning about "untamed sorrow" lacks immediate consequence, slightly softening middle pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of grief given wings that "chose to stay"—pain transformed but not banished, made bearable through sharing. The recurring shadow/body separation literalizes loss while the cranes embody grief's transformation from isolation to connection. The final image of satisfied night folding into silence resonates without stating a moral, though some symbolic elements (luna moth, censers) feel slightly ornamental rather than essential.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lyrical voice maintains consistent elevation with controlled rhythm ("Its paper skin quivered like a luna moth because the wind was tasting for sorrow") and purposeful compression that suits the dreamlike tone. POV remains stable with Lyra's perceptual signature filtering the surreal world. Some diction occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("luminous torment," "quiet catastrophes") rather than staying grounded in her craftsperson's sensibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and vivid imagery, with sentences like "Patrons whispered polite tragedies while koi swam through the air like censers leaking color" demonstrating controlled density. However, abstract phrases accumulate ("luminous torment," "quiet catastrophes," "mobile of quiet catastrophes") creating occasional opacity, and some metaphors strain coherence (horizon pivoting like a mobile). The final third maintains clarity through the crane release sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of magical realism with grief processing through lantern-craft offers fresh specificity—dream recordings on crystalline spindles, paper cranes as surrogate shadows, the Great Disconnect as worldbuilding. The concept of descending while ascending creates both physical and thematic resonance. While shadow-loss as grief metaphor isn't entirely novel, the execution through specific craft details and the basilica's dream-recording system elevates beyond template.</comment>
