<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sulin's motivation to understand time dilation in crisis is consistently embodied through concrete actions—studying footprints, interpreting ink patterns, descending into the glyph well. His "serene anger" manifests as controlled investigation rather than emotional display, and his final choice to hunt the architects carries visible cost as he commits to an uncertain journey through "breathless hollows of time."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens as Sulin discovers layers of the disappearance mystery through ink patterns that build toward understanding the time-harvest chamber. Closure lands as Charged Poise when Sulin drops into the glyph well, crystallizing his commitment to justice with the cost of entering an unknown temporal dimension explicitly shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment and disappearing ink constrain Sulin's investigation methods, forcing him to decode fluid patterns rather than follow conventional tracks. The liminal chamber's architecture of "suspended campers drifting like seeds" creates specific spatial pressure for his descent choice, though some descriptive passages lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from missing persons to discovering a time-harvesting mechanism that could "power weapons, empires, or even immortality," with Sulin's anger transforming from frustration to clarity. His final descent into the glyph well represents agency through calculated risk, accepting unknown temporal consequences to pursue justice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of time's malleability under crisis emerges through concrete discovery—the universe "inhales fear, expanding space beneath every ticking atom." The final image of an albino tracker "painting futures in vanishing script" resonantly answers why time slows without stating a moral, though some philosophical passages edge toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sulin's perceptual signature filters everything through tracker sensibility—reading sand patterns, tasting questions in wind, recognizing nomad mathematical codes. The prose maintains consistent distance with controlled shifts during the chamber revelation, though occasional elevated diction ("liminal chamber," "ephemeral patterns") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences advancing discovery or atmosphere, but figurative language occasionally overwhelms clarity ("canvas ridges like reluctant ink," "words erased mid thought"). Some template cadence appears in the chamber description sequence, though the closing lines achieve strong propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of time-harvesting through crisis moments offers a fresh angle on temporal manipulation, with specific world-building through "nomad mathematicians" and the ink-based portal system. The integration of tracker skills with temporal investigation creates an organic synthesis, though the resolution follows somewhat predictable hero's journey patterns.</comment>
