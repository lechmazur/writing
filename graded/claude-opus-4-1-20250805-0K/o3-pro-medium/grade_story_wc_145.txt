<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Morrow's dry wit and cartographic skepticism drive authentic choices throughout, from tracing condensation patterns to descending into the luminous pool. His final realization that the atlas must be spoken rather than printed represents earned character growth with visible cost—he must abandon his life's work format. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("carrying no artifacts but bearing every river's first syllable") that lacks full embodiment in the climactic moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural design where condensation patterns, multilingual incantations, and luminous water accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—the discovery that rivers' origins can only be held in memory, not mapped. The cost is legible: Morrow's printed atlas becomes impossible, forcing him into oral tradition. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (lake location remains vague) and some causality softness around how speaking creates physical changes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen lake, underground font with amber pool, and rusted-then-renewed outpost create vivid setting that constrains choices—the ice must be crossed, the grate opened, the stairs descended. The warm mist "smelling of loam and mountain thyme" beneath centuries of ice provides strong sensory contrast. Deduction for some spatial vagueness (the outpost's relation to the lake) and the final transformation of the outpost walls feeling slightly unmotivated by prior physical logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from cartographic curiosity through physical danger on cracking ice to the fundamental impossibility of Morrow's life's work—strong accumulative tightening. The moment when his pen "bled harmlessly into the humid air" forces genuine renunciation with clear cost. Deduction for somewhat passive agency in middle beats (following Yara's lead) and the falcon's role remaining ornamental rather than pressuring choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central paradox: mapping requires fixity but water remembers through flow. The polyglot incantation and the final image of "every river's first syllable in shared breath" resonantly answers whether origins can be mapped. Strong subtext in "Maps can lie, Mr Finch, but margins gossip." Minor deduction for the slightly overwrought "singular convergence" mythologizing that borders on abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends dry cartographic precision ("armed with ink, calipers, and skepticism") with lyrical perception ("feathery lacunae, thin and bright"). Yara's voice effectively distinguishes through cryptic wisdom. Some register elevation in peak moments ("nadir," "conduits," "alphabetize") slightly exceeds the established lexicon. The controlled rhythm during the descent sequence effectively heightens tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("Steam hissed behind him, yet the surrounding hush pressed closer"). Information density is high and sentences effectively vary. Deductions for abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy ("carrying no artifacts but bearing every river's first syllable"), some filter constructions ("Morrow felt ridiculous"), and elevated diction in places ("polyglot's phrasebook dog-ear," "feathery lacunae") that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartographic impossibility with mystical discovery—the concept that some knowledge resists documentation is handled with originality. The specific detail of condensation patterns creating maps and the multilingual incantation opening physical reality shows genuine ingenuity. The transformation from rust to bright steel provides unexpected visual payoff. Slight deduction for familiar mystical-pool imagery despite the strong execution.</comment>
