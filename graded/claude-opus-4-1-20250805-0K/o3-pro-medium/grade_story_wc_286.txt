<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rua's motivation to understand temporal resistance is clear and drives concrete actions like rotating the lantern and shaping clay cups. His zen-minded patience contrasts effectively with the fractured urgency of the timelines. The final choice to build a kiln from salvaged materials shows earned endurance with visible cost (accepting the broken world while working toward mercy).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through layered timeline visions and the recurring "phototropic to kindness" motif that charges the final image. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Rua commits to building the kiln, accepting his role in the cycle of offering vessels for the oasis's promise. The cost is felt in "chest ache with recognition" and the acceptance of impermanence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The oasis functions as both setting and character, with its fractured timelines constraining Rua's choices and the lantern glass becoming a tool that enables perception shifts. Sensory details like "nectar drip from a future already abolished" and "marble grains" make the impossible physics tangible. The environment directly shapes the final decision to build with "collapsed hive boxes and salvaged adobe."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why places resist change—escalates through the timeline fractures revealing "virgin green, prosperous hive-song, and charred desolation" simultaneously. Pressure coheres when Rua realizes he must offer vessels for the oasis's oldest promise, with visible cost in accepting temporal instability. The deepening from observation to participation drives the closure effectively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete image system of vessels, light, and kindness without explicit moralizing. The final insight that "resistance to change can itself shape evolution" reweights all prior material, especially the pottery/kiln metaphor. "Kindness is the only light that survives scorching" arrives through embodied discovery, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature with Rua experiencing time as pottery ("cracked open like sunrise over clay," "glazed porcelain cooling"). The lyric compression serves the fractured timeline concept, teaching its pattern early through "echo of bees that should have perished." Voice maintains zen-like patience even under temporal pressure, with controlled rhythm throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "exhaled dust instead of doubt" and effective compression. Some figurative density in places ("phototropic to kindness" appears 4 times) borders on overuse but serves the accumulative pattern. Minor template cadence in "Rua saw...He reached out...He realized" sequence deducts -0.4. Information density high with most lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fractured timeline concept offers a fresh angle on apocalyptic settings, with the pottery-as-temporal-kiln metaphor feeling earned and specific. The synthesis of beekeeping, pottery, and time fractures creates something non-obvious that feels inevitable by closure. Risk-taking in the lyric/accumulative structure heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
