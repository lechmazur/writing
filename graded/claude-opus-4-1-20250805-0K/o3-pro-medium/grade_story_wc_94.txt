<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet's internal contradiction between censorship and truth-seeking drives coherent motivation, with the timer ritual revealing layered psychological need. The discovery of the map creates a genuine reversal that earns the final choice to "publish himself to the sky," though some interior passages lean toward abstract articulation rather than embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the timer ritual building density toward the map discovery and final self-publication to sky. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the poet carries "their script within his ribs," though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually implied through "editors prepared fresh ink to censor tomorrow."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observatory setting actively constrains and enables the poet's vigil, with altitude rarefying lungs and storm providing both witness and co-author. The darkroom timer's repurposing from measuring exposure to measuring silence brilliantly integrates setting with thematic purpose, charging the final image of the building "awaiting the next pilgrim."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the timer's ticks revealing inherited war, lost love, and censored words, culminating in the map discovery that reframes his search. The poet's agency manifests in choosing to carry the map and write with "ink that refused erasure," though the external pressure from censorship remains somewhat abstract until the final acknowledgment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the cartography metaphor—pain mapped as landscape, scars as navigable continents—without explicit moralizing. The final line "We breathe so scars can speak" offers resonant synthesis, and the observatory as confession temple deepens the exploration of private wounds becoming public testimony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains poetic register with controlled metaphoric density ("clouds like a lighthouse adrift in heaven"), though occasionally drifts toward elevated diction that strains the intimacy. The perceptual signature stays consistent through storm imagery and cartographic language, with strong rhythmic control in the timer sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of striking imagery but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most high-pressure sentences without clear payoff ("furiously tranquil" repeats without evolution). Some passages loop conceptually ("the pause had taught him the grammar of thunder and the syntax of broken skin") and occasional register drift into abstract philosophy dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The repurposing of darkroom timer to measure silence shows genuine ingenuity, as does the cartography-of-scars concept linking censorship to bodily mapping. The observatory-as-confessional and the reversal of someone having already mapped the poet's wounds offer fresh angles, though some metaphoric connections feel forced.</comment>
