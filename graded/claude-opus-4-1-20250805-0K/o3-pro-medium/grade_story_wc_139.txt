I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Identified:** Causal - the story operates through clear because/therefore linkages, with Mara's choices driving the escalation toward escape.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's characterization excels through embodied tension ("pulse scrawled proofs against her ribs") and the inherited contradiction between her father's con artistry and her honest nature. The minister remains underdeveloped beyond victim status. Internal conflict manifests beautifully in her calculation of "fear versus value," though the resolution feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with clear cost (Corvus's death, exile), and causal chains hold throughout. The glass shard setup feels mechanical despite early placement. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3, and the escape mechanism follows logically from established elements.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The funeral home setting constrains choices effectively through refrigeration units, body bags, and chemical atmosphere ("formaldehyde mist hung like philosophy"). Sensory detail supports tension without overwhelming. The ink pot functions as micro-setting that enables the climactic turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional discretion to life-or-death through Corvus's threat ("the next bag will hold you"). The glass shard resolution arrives too easily despite setup. Cost registers through exile and Corvus's death, though protagonist agency in the killing feels accidental rather than fully earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of fair exchange emerges organically through Mara's mathematical pursuit of balance her father never achieved. The ending's "imperfect balance" acknowledges moral complexity. Subtext operates well through the ink pot's dual nature and Mara's internal calculations, though some philosophical framing feels imposed ("formaldehyde mist hung like philosophy").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with philosophical register and mathematical metaphors fitting Mara's perspective. Some overwriting appears ("deathly vitality," "unreleased theorem"). Dialogue functions effectively when present, though limited. The perceptual signature of calculating exchange rates distinguishes the POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from overwriting in places ("twitching like an unreleased theorem," "pulse scrawled proofs"). Strong moments like "waiting actively like water eroding stone" balance weaker metaphors. Information density generally high, though some philosophical abstractions slow momentum. Template phrases appear ("minutes passed heavy with").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The funeral home as escape route offers freshness, and the con artist's honest child provides character specificity. The glass shard mechanism feels convenient despite setup. Mathematical language of fair exchange creates distinctive texture, though some elements feel workshopped rather than organic.</comment>
