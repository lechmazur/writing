<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to discover his sister's truth is clear and drives every choice, with internal conflict between obedience and curiosity crystallizing at closure. The embodied synesthesia ("tasted brine and ozone," "flavor of gravity") makes his sensory mapper profession tangible. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("weight of a withheld truth") and the sister's exposition feeling slightly convenient, though her hologram scene carries genuine emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with sensory details building toward Kael's decisive choice to redirect gates and accept guardianship. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he renounces discovery for concealment with visible cost ("resolved to map not roads but lacunae"). Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the cyclical pattern pays off through synchronized spontaneity across universes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The repair bay and sensory mapping create a lived-in world where taste/smell/texture become navigational coordinates. Strong micro-setting work with the green shard constraining choices throughout. Spatial choreography through parallel universes remains coherent ("helix of perfume"). Deduction for some generic descriptors ("blistered ceiling," "rusted bulkheads") that could be more specific to this POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to protecting reality from weaponization, with Kael's agency driving the tunnel navigation and final choice. The sister's revelation reframes everything, forcing him to choose between discovery and concealment with clear cost. Minor deduction because the antagonistic "employers" remain abstract rather than embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between mapping/discovery versus concealment/protection, with the final image of mapping "lacunae, the safe blanks where tyrants lose direction" offering a resonant non-literal answer. The recurring shard and lullaby wavelengths accumulate meaning. Slight deduction for the sister's dialogue edging toward explicit theme statement about "harvesting sensory cartographers."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with sensory-filtered perception ("murmur of half-remembered dreams," "ribbons of smell, sound, pressure"). Controlled psychic distance and consistent POV. The sister's dialogue carries appropriate urgency though occasionally drifts toward exposition. Strong perceptual signature throughout with synesthetic details serving character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good information density and varied sentence structures. Strong opening and closing lines that mirror each other purposefully. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("weight of a withheld truth"), some filter constructions ("he realized," "he understood"), and slight overwriting in metaphorical density during the tunnel sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory mapping with parallel universe navigation creates an original premise. The concept of mapping "lacunae" as protective blanks transforms the typical explorer narrative. Risk-taking in the synesthetic world-building and non-violent resolution heightens meaning. The cyclical spontaneity trait adds unique texture to the multiverse concept.</comment>
