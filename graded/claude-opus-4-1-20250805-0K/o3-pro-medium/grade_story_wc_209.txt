I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through layered imagery (amber light, postcards, cathedral glass) that culminates in the phosphorescent mural's awakening—a pattern break that reweights the grandfather's question with visible transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maris's motivation is clear and rooted in her promise to solve her grandfather's riddle before winter's end. Her internal progression from pursuing colors "outside pigment and plaster" to creating phosphorescent murals shows genuine character evolution. The micro-choice to use the cathedral's cipher for her street art reveals values with visible cost—she transforms from seeker to creator.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Maris's mural awakens at midnight, answering the grandfather's question through action rather than explanation—"flowers bloom at night not for secrecy but for communion." The accumulative structure builds through postcards→cathedral→revelation→creation with clear cost: "Tears welled, not of sorrow but of continuation." The orientation is immediate and the textural lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting functions as more than backdrop—the cathedral's "hidden layers of etched glass" literally contains the answer Maris seeks, and the "amber pavilion" frames her initial contemplation with brass-colored light that mirrors her later phosphorescent work. Brother Ellion's "brass key shaped like an aster" connects floral imagery to access. The melting snow creates temporal pressure that drives the search.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—solving the grandfather's riddle before winter's end—creates coherent pressure that deepens through discovery rather than reversal. The tightening occurs when Maris deciphers the "botanical instructions" and realizes her grandfather "died before winter fully lifted," forcing her to complete his quest. The cost manifests in her tears of continuation and the ephemeral nature of her creation that "would fade with the coming dawn."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of night-blooming flowers as metaphor for hidden vitality—"Night became not absence but an ultraviolet presence." The final mural scene offers a non-literal answer where "crowds gathered, words evaporating as petals of luminous paint unfurled," demonstrating communion through shared silence. The concept avoids moralizing while embracing the complexity of creation that requires darkness to reveal light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary elevation with controlled rhythm—"dying leaves colored the light like liquid brass" shows careful modulation. The perceptual signature focuses on light and color befitting a mural artist. Minor weakness in dialogue mechanics where Brother Ellion speaks only once, though his withdrawal "as though swallowed by the hush he served" maintains atmospheric coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"candles guttered in their sconces, releasing an umbral tenderness" combines action, atmosphere, and thematic echo. However, some figurative density approaches overwriting: "frost-bitten twigs" for eyebrows, "hissed like comets" for spray paint. The recurring "dawning hush" and "umbral tenderness" risk becoming template phrases though they serve the accumulative structure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story transforms the familiar artist's-quest narrative through its specific synthesis of street art and sacred space, nocturnal botany and phosphorescent paint. The revelation that flowers bloom at night for "communion" rather than secrecy offers a non-obvious insight. The risk of mixing cathedral mysticism with street art pays off when Maris creates ephemeral beauty that "would fade with the coming dawn," accepting impermanence.</comment>
