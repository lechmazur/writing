I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring an Accumulative/Textural drive lens based on the lyric progression and pattern-based structure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arlen's seasonally mute condition creates genuine constraint that shapes every choice, from his kinetic sculpture solution to the carved choreography instructions. His motivation to preserve "the color of wonder" drives consistent action through embodied listening ("with the whole cage of his ribs") and tactile problem-solving. The council scene shows effective secondary pressure forcing non-verbal communication. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around wonder that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Arlen's carved instructions ensure the sculpture's survival beyond his seasonal muteness, with clear cost (accepting his cyclic limitation). The accumulative structure builds through sensory layers—sound, color, vibration—cohering at "color, truth, and wonder kept their careful concord." Who/where/when anchored early ("Whispering bluff above the clouds"). The lens holds consistently through pattern accumulation rather than causal turns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bluff setting actively constrains choices—rope bridges for access, wind stealing vowels, fog as canvas for prismatic light. Exceptional integration of iceberg fragment as micro-setting that both threatens (fracture risk) and enables (color preservation). "Clouds that curled like parchment in an invisible library" and "churning sky" below create vivid vertical geography. The environment directly shapes the sculpture's function and Arlen's solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder through the sculpture) escalates through council's structural concerns, then the discovered hairline crack threatening the iceberg. Arlen's agency manifests through kinetic design, silent demonstration, and preventive repair "measured by heartbeats rather than hammers." Cost is visible in accepting cyclic muteness while ensuring continuity. Could strengthen with more immediate physical risk during the repair sequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the marriage of ice and sound, silence and communication, impermanence and preservation. The "symphonies of truth beyond the reach of syllables" concept earns its abstraction through concrete demonstration. The carved instructions become a non-verbal language preserving wonder across time. Final image of "muted vigor thrummed through the world" resonates without moralizing, reweighting silence as amplification rather than loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("vowels were stolen by wind," "bronze awaiting pitch"). POV maintains consistent limited perspective through Arlen's sensory experience. Some elevated diction ("harmonious bell tuner," "kinetic sculpture") fits the ethereal setting but occasionally drifts toward preciousness. Strong perceptual signature in how Arlen experiences sound through his body. No dialogue maintains the mute season's constraint effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density high in descriptive passages. However, abstract phrases like "color of wonder" and "symphonies of truth" appear multiple times without sufficient grounding. Some purple moments ("Dawn arrived as a pale chord") work within the lyric mode but accumulate densely. Line "Muted vigor thrummed through the world" effectively closes but edges toward overwrought.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of muteness as creative constraint rather than limitation, with the kinetic sculpture as non-verbal language. The iceberg fragment preserving ancient color through sound creates an original sensory crossing. Risk-taking in the fully non-verbal approach and abstract conceptual frame mostly succeeds. The solution of carved choreographic instructions is inventive. Slight deduction for leaning on ethereal beauty without enough grounding in physical struggle.</comment>
