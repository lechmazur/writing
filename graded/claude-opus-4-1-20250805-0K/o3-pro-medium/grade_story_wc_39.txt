<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to preserve and share forgotten sounds is clear and consistent, driving him to release the music box into the world despite his own loneliness. His internal contradiction between wanting connection and accepting isolation manifests through concrete actions. The family's grief and eventual healing provide authentic emotional stakes. Minor deduction for the children being somewhat underdeveloped as individuals.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the jar-opening sequence toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the music box slides into daylight. The cost is felt in "his own heart thrummed with the same lonesome splendor" - the poet remains alone while enabling others' connection. Orientation anchors (vagrant poet, dawn, dune loft) establish by ~60 words. The closure lands with visible sacrifice as he releases his creation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The feral loft with its "broken beams, salt-torn tapestries" creates atmospheric pressure while the jars themselves function as micro-setting that constrains choices. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("sand freckles," "moonlit tide pools"). The setting actively shapes the narrative through the threshold placement of the music box. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of preserving/transmitting memory escalates through the family's arrival and peaks when the grandmother's hum reconnects them. Meaningful deepening occurs as the poet realizes his role "wasn't merely to store echoes but to sequence them into language." The cost manifests in his acceptance of perpetual loneliness while serving others. One clear tightening that forecloses his own connection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of bottled sounds becoming bridges between generations. The final image of the music box sliding away while "future voices [knock] from inside the glass" offers a non-literal answer about memory's role in healing. Subtext operates beautifully in "Wind outside paused, embarrassed to interrupt." The poet's lonesome splendor embodies the theme without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "sand freckles," "yesterday's laughter glowed inside like fireflies." Voice maintains consistent wistful tone with controlled lyricism. Dialogue feels natural and advances plot ("Are you the jar keeper?"). Minor compression in emotional peaks is appropriate. Some filter verbs ("he realized," "he knew") slightly dull immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong imagistic clarity with lines like "coins in his pocket faintly chinging like distant bells." Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some repetitive structures appear ("He [verb]" pattern in paragraphs 15-20). Minor scaffold in "he realized" constructions. The closing image lands cleanly without loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of capturing sounds in jars and using them to heal grief shows genuine originality. The transformation of a carousel music box into a vessel for ancestral memory feels earned. Specific details like "Grandmother Humming Under Storm Roof" avoid generic templates. The poet as translator between generations offers a fresh angle on memory and loss.</comment>
