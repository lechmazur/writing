I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and sensory details toward a resonant final moment where the bell's impossible chord calms the acid sea.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like coaxing her cart-glider and whispering jokes to acid. The "steadily curious" trait drives her choices consistently. However, internal conflict remains understated - we see her irreverent awe but limited contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when the bell's sub-audible chord ripples the acid sea and rusted buoys answer - a clear before/after with felt cost (the bell calls to things, not people). The accumulative lens holds as density increases toward this crystallized moment. Minor orientation delay (who/where anchors emerge gradually) costs 0.2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The acid sea and workshop setting directly constrain choices - Liora must bargain with the corrosive sea, work around its dangers. Sensory detail is vivid ("ozone and mischief," "sulfur light," "citrus fumes"). The environment actively shapes tactics and the final image of the calmed acid sea.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (creating an unheard bell) tightens through the arrow-ricochet discovery and culminates in the bell actually working but calling to things rather than people - a meaningful deepening. Cost is visible when the bell's success comes with isolation. Escalation is subtle but present under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the yearning algorithm that "calculated desires instead of numbers" and the bell that rings for things, not people - a resonant answer about creation and connection. The final ticker tape message about risking sounding ridiculous edges toward explicit but remains earned through prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive with inventive phrases like "wheeled wings," "nibbling iron pilings into lace," and "irreverent awe." The perceptual signature is consistent - Liora notices movement and mechanical possibility. Minor diction elevation ("transliterate whirling pictures") doesn't break POV but prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density and varied rhythm. However, some ornamental figurative language doesn't advance pressure ("sulfur light like a forbidden gem," "gossip scribbling prophecy"). The "Throughout the evolution" phrase repeats three times, creating mild template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The yearning algorithm that calculates desires instead of numbers is genuinely fresh, as is the bell that rings below human hearing to calm acid seas. The synthesis of maker-mysticism with irreverent experimentation feels specific and earned. Risk-taking in the conceptual design heightens coherence.</comment>
