I'll evaluate this story through the lens of Accumulative/Textural, as the piece builds through layered images and metaphors toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than strict causal progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marella's motivation crystallizes beautifully through the jade cicada sequence—her realization about "the texture of time" and how to "tune one's speech to its grooves" drives a genuine internal shift. The contradictory impulses (righteous anger vs. strategic restraint) play out in her vision, earning the final choice. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("texture of time was not smooth but corrugated") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Marella's decision to approach the council "like a gentle tide, not a storm surge," showing clear cost in restraining her righteous anger. The accumulative structure coheres well through tidal/temporal metaphors building to this crystallized stance. Deduction for slightly abstract cost articulation—the emotional price of restraint could be more viscerally felt in the final beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The grotto setting actively shapes the story—its acoustics enable the cicada's awakening, and the tidal environment mirrors the temporal themes throughout. Strong sensory work with "the sea comb its fingers through stone" and the grotto as "submerged cathedral." The setting constrains choice when Marella must use the grotto's specific properties to coax the cicada.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to island preservation as Marella's vision reveals the council confrontation's dual paths. The tightening occurs when she sees both her failure through anger and success through restraint, forcing a genuine choice. Cost is visible in her need to suppress justified rage for strategic gain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of tides/time/transition, culminating in "transition periods are nothing but cosmic hesitations." The jade cicada's oblique awakening mirrors the indirect approach needed for the council. The final image of stars as "polite listeners" and night's "patient discourse on becoming" offers resonant closure without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with marine imagery threading throughout ("tidal-pool chronicler," "surf recede," "cool as low tide"). Some elevated diction ("gnomic tablets," "corrugated") occasionally strains against Marella's naturalist perspective. Dialogue between Marella and Quillon carries appropriate weight and subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose flows with good rhythm variety and strong imagery, but several abstract constructions weaken immediacy ("the texture of time was not smooth but corrugated," "transition periods, those subtle crackles in the flow of existence"). Some filter-verb clusters ("she felt," "she foresaw," "she realized") in the vision sequence dull propulsion. No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The jade cicada that responds to oblique approach offers a fresh take on the oracle/prophecy trope. The parallel between tidal patterns and temporal decision points creates organic originality. The specific synthesis of marine biology expertise with temporal philosophy feels earned rather than forced.</comment>
