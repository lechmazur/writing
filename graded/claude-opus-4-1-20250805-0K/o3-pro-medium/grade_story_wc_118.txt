<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ursa's motivation is clear and embodied through tactile actions (hovering fingertips, light-fiber surgery), and her sensitivity to "murmurs ordinary ears let scurry away" drives specific choices. The kinship with Clemency creates resonant doubling, though the final realization about historians as cog-teeth feels slightly abstract compared to the visceral page-handling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural lens with density increasing through diary fragments → tapestry → wall vibrations → final understanding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Ursa grasps her role in the "hidden cog" with cost implied through "trembling notes" and the weight of waiting ages. Orientation anchors smoothly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The silo as "brushed bronze pillar" and "opened spine" creates immediate atmosphere, while micro-settings (child-sized fireplace, moth-wing pages) constrain Ursa's delicate extraction methods. The final "bronze quiet" carrying "the faintest promise" charges the ending image perfectly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from collecting stories → discovering Clemency's axis theory → understanding walls as memory-teeth → realizing her cosmic role. The tightening through "walls will turn the sky's lever" to Ursa's trembling comprehension shows clear progression, though the cosmic scale slightly abstracts the personal cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The "displaced axis" elegantly bridges physical/moral/temporal meanings, with Clemency's child-wisdom about walls listening creating powerful resonance with Ursa's mission. The final image of wind tilting "minutely but undeniably" offers a non-literal answer about collective memory healing fractured worlds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through compounds ("mold-husks," "light-fiber"), selective perception ("smelled faintly of tannin and forgotten scolding"), and consistent bronze/metallic register. The prose modulates from delicate precision during extraction to cosmic expansion at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("rose like a brushed bronze pillar" = setting/atmosphere/theme). Some mild elevation in abstract passages ("moral centers tilting realms") but propulsion remains strong through concrete action-verbs and varied syntax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archive-fiction with cosmic fantasy through the child-archivist doubling and walls-as-memory concept. The "displaced axis" as both astronomical and moral phenomenon shows genuine originality, earning the risk distinction for unconventional scope-shift that maintains coherence.</comment>
