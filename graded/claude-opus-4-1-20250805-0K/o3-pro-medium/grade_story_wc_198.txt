<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kieran's motivation to silence the prophecy is clear and drives consistent action throughout. His internal experience layers nostalgia for his mother's music with present purpose, creating genuine complexity. The final choice to play the lullaby after completing his task reveals character through micro-choice with emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through sound imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the prophecy dissolves into "negative space." The closure lands with conceptual cost—catastrophe prevented through artistic erasure. Orientation anchors clearly by line 4, and the lens holds consistently through musical accumulation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The grotto's acoustic properties and prism atrium directly constrain Kieran's method—he must guide sound through specific glass-refracted corridors. Sensory detail filters through a musician's perception ("silver air," "stone vowels"). The glasshouse's "negative space created by shattered glass" functions as essential setting that enables closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation reads through textural intensification as the prophecy approaches and Kieran steers it via saxophone into the prism's scrambling effect. The dominant stake—preventing panic through musical silencing—tightens as "stone vowels crawled up the walls, seeking throats to borrow." Cost is legible in his "chest aching from the effort."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concept of "vested hush"—purposeful silence as protection. The ending's gift of his mother's lullaby to the empty space reweights the entire silencing as an act of love rather than mere prevention. Subtext operates through what remains unspoken to the council and the "story that would never be spoken."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive musical perception saturates the prose ("memories trying to remember themselves," "fog blossomed from the bell like pale lilies"). POV remains strictly controlled through Kieran's consciousness. The lyric compression and patterned elision ("as dewdrops form") serves the accumulative design and pays off in the circular ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in peak beats ("stone vowels," "tuning forks struck by invisible hammers") risks overwriting but remains coherent. Minor template cadence appears in "He + verb" constructions mid-story. The prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of musical performance as prophetic containment through acoustic refraction offers genuine freshness. "Vested hush" as active silencing transforms the expected hero-saves-world template through specific artistic means. The risk of lyric accumulation over traditional conflict pays off with coherent closure.</comment>
