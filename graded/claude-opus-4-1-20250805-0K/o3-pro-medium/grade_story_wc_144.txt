<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's blindness creates genuine constraint that shapes her unique method of repair through water and sound, with Rowan's apprentice perspective providing grounded interiority. The final moment where she translates drone feedback into navigation coordinates demonstrates earned competence with visible stakes. Minor deduction for Rowan's relatively passive observer role lacking internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details of water, light, and sound build toward the successful repair enabling the ship's departure. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara's "Direction is only hidden until we decode the feedback we already carry" reweights her blindness from disability to mastery, with cost visible in the time pressure of the maiden voyage. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The water basins function as essential tools constraining Mara's repair method, with each basin's specific properties (rectangular/obsidian-rimmed/glass-bottomed) enabling different diagnostic insights. The depot's "magnetic calm" and interplay of steam/mist create atmospheric pressure that charges the final image of "quiet ripples of water."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Time pressure from the anchor lifting creates urgency ("we had minutes before the captain required guidance"), with escalation through three increasingly precise diagnostic stages. Cost manifests in the stakes of synchronized harbor/rail schedules that would "splinter like wet driftwood" without success, though the repair proceeds without significant reversal or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Mara's paradoxical sight-through-blindness, culminating in "Direction is only hidden until we decode the feedback we already carry" which reframes limitation as alternate perception. The water basins become a recurring motif of indirect clarity, with the final "quiet ripples" resonating as both literal tool and metaphor for pattern-finding beneath noise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Rowan's apprentice voice noting precise technical details ("three grains of tungsten") while maintaining reverent distance from Mara's mastery. Some filter-verb clusters ("I positioned," "I unscrewed," "I followed") slightly dull immediacy in repair sequences but voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong sensory specificity ("milk blue and serenely steady," "brass feathers chipped") with varied sentence rhythms matching scene tempo. Deductions for repetitive "Mara [verb]" constructions across 4-5 lines and occasional overwriting ("magnetic calm anchored in her chest"). Information density high in diagnostic sequences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The blind artisan using water refraction to diagnose mechanical problems offers genuine freshness, avoiding disability clichés through specific technical application. The synthesis of rail depot, harbor navigation, and sensory mastery creates an organic world, though some elements (hummingbird drone, Captain Vale) feel slightly generic within their functions.</comment>
