I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category according to the rubric.

**Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causality, with density increasing toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara integrates her fractured selves.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion through "woke numb, memories muffled like distant drums beneath glacier ice" and the physical transformation of clones into orchids/rainfall. The final integration earns its cost through prior accumulation of sensory recovery. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("living narrative called personhood").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - Mara's integration of her clones through "complementary opposites" reconfigures her numbness into feeling with visible cost (tears becoming seeds, clones dissolving). The accumulative lens holds throughout with pattern-taught imagery. Slight opacity in the middle third prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating dojo and transforming landscape effectively constrain choices and mirror internal states. Strong selective detail in "fractured air currents" and "crimson fluid glimmered." The jar functions as micro-setting that charges the final integration. Some vagueness in spatial choreography during the sitting sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on reclaiming feeling through confronting identity fragmentation. The complementary breathing sequence meaningfully deepens pressure through synchronization. Cost is visible in the clones' dissolution and Mara's tears. The accumulative build works but lacks a sharper tightening moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the integration of opposites - "Personhood thrived only when shared, when opposite halves danced." The final lake image resonantly answers the numbness question without moralizing. Strong subtext in the clones' transformations into nurturing elements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("memories muffled like distant drums beneath glacier ice"). Some register elevation that strains POV plausibility ("vivifying the caverns she had walled"). The perceptual signature stays consistent but occasionally drifts into overwrought territory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with strong rhythm variation, but figurative density overwhelms in places ("Pale lightning climbed from the exposed brain, entering her chest, performing surgery without blades"). Several instances of elevated diction clash with immediacy. The "her logic still slices through pretense" callback feels forced.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ego death with clone identity crisis creates non-obvious angles. The complementary opposites resolution and environmental responsiveness to internal states show risk-taking that heightens meaning. Some familiar beats (meditation circle, transformation sequence) prevent higher scoring.</comment>
