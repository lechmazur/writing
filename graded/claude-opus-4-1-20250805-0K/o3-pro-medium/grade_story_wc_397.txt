I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and cadence shifts rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction between seeking endings while discovering patience through labor is embodied through concrete actions (turning the parasol tip, trawling debris, playing harmonica). The final choice to postpone departure emerges naturally from accumulated experience rather than sudden epiphany, with visible emotional cost in "the quiet weight of postponed departure."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis—Mara's decision to wait becomes a form of active patience with clear cost ("postponed departure"). The accumulative structure coheres as density increases from solitary arrival to communal singing, though the disaster backstory slightly exceeds the 20% reflection allowance without fully anchoring present choices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina functions as more than setting—the ice's "plural accents of endings" and "tectonic lullaby" directly shape Mara's final realization. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (frost on eyelashes, tar-black coffee, ice breathing), with the environment constraining choices through the blizzard that traps the crew together.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative density—from solitary pier arrival to trawling work to communal shelter during the blizzard, each phase deepening Mara's understanding of endings' "many dialects." The harmonica moment creates meaningful pressure that forces stance crystallization, though the cost could be more viscerally felt in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of learning "endings' many dialects" emerges organically through concrete salvage work and ice movements, never stated abstractly. The final image of ice syllables harmonizing with breath offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire journey from death-seeking to patience without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature emerges through Mara's synesthetic attention to sound ("silk rustle beneath thunder," "ice breathe alongside her own lungs"). Some filter-verb clustering appears ("she felt," "she sensed," "she wondered") but the lyric compression and rhythmic control during the harmonica scene demonstrates strong voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("Windborne solace" appears twice identically; "fold in patience" echoes without evolution). Template cadence runs appear ("She had...She felt...She turned...She waited") and some elevated diction drifts from the established register ("tectonic lullaby," "plural accents").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of euthanasia tourism with ice-trawling work offers a non-obvious angle on confronting mortality. The harmonica as ambulance siren memory and the parasol tip's whistle resembling the landslide's sigh demonstrate specific transformation of familiar death-journey material through lived detail.</comment>
