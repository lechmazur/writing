<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction between scientific detachment and intuitive pattern-seeking drives authentic choices, particularly when she rejects Jonah's procedural urgency for patient observation. The final choice to clear the trench emerges causally from her neutron star expertise applied to botanical recovery, with visible cost in physical labor and professional risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear accumulative/textural lens established through dust patterns that accumulate meaning until the drainage decision crystallizes as Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with felt cost as Jonah tears up the insurance form, reconfiguring from demolition to recovery. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established within first two sentences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as active setting—broken panes create dust patterns that guide the discovery, the collapsed trench becomes the solution path. Sensory detail filters through Mara's scientific POV ("glittered like tidal shards," "brackish water that reflected sunlight in pulsing morse"). However, the setting doesn't fully constrain the final choice, keeping it below 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvaging vs. razing) established early and deepens through dust-reading discovery to drainage action. The escalation follows accumulative logic as patterns cohere into actionable insight, with Jonah's shift from resistance to participation marking the meaningful turn. Cost is visible in physical labor and Jonah's torn-up form.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between neutron star decay and greenhouse recovery—"gradual change is the universe negotiating peace with entropy." The final image of the river's "gentle persistence" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the entire recovery process as natural rather than catastrophic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct scientific voice with consistent perceptual signature ("neutron star atmospheres, where matter preprocesses reality"). Dialogue carries natural subtext—Jonah's "We are astrophysicists, not gardeners" reveals professional anxiety beneath procedural mask. Minor register elevation in some metaphors ("breathable tarp," "kindled humility") slightly above POV baseline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("mud sucking at their boots in wet applause"), but several overwritten metaphors strain clarity ("silence folded over the property like a breathable tarp"). Template cadence appears in mid-section ("She realized... She told Jonah... She would later feed..."). Information density adequate but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics and botanical recovery through butterfly dust as interstellar grain analog. The specific angle of using neutron star crust migration to understand flood recovery transforms familiar disaster-recovery narrative. However, some metaphorical reaches feel forced rather than inevitable.</comment>
