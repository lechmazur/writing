<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal contradiction between confidence and uncertainty drives authentic choices, particularly in the shift from editing to listening. The decision to "unbend ambitions" and travel alongside events rather than ahead represents earned character evolution with visible cost—retiring the pen and accepting limitation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the narrator shifts from active editor to listener, with felt cost in accepting the pen's retirement and the weight of past failures. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through layered metaphors (commas, threshing, gardening) that reweight the central question of intervention versus accompaniment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The basalt moon platform and gravitational anomaly actively constrain choices—gravity curls sideways, the narrator must anchor boots, and the anomaly provides temporal ink. The environment doesn't just frame action but supplies the means (time distillate) and pressure (disapproving cold) that shape the narrator's tactical shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal failure ("planting wrong seeds") through attempted corrections to the ethical question of intervention itself. The anomaly's surge and self-confrontation image force the narrator to choose between accepting past mistakes or remaining barren, with clear cost in retiring agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the comma metaphor—pauses that don't erase—developing into the river/stones image of accompaniment versus blocking. The final image of the anomaly closing "like a well-placed comma, promising nothing, permitting everything" perfectly crystallizes the thematic shift from correction to presence without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends technical precision ("celestial signal interpreter," "gravitational anomaly") with poetic compression ("tomorrow's bruises," "thresh meaning"). The perceptual signature—seeing time as editable text, gravity as local recognition—remains consistent while modulating effectively under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong metaphorical coherence, though some passages edge toward density ("confidently uncertain" appears twice; extended gardening metaphor). The comma/editing conceit carries multiple narrative jobs effectively. Minor template cadence in "For the civilization of Heliora... For the migratory libraries" structure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic SF with copyediting metaphor creates non-obvious angle on time manipulation. The specific detail of blood becoming temporal ink and the ethical pivot from editing to accompanying show genuine originality beyond surface novelty.</comment>
