<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eira's motivation to "uncage something older than speech" drives concrete choices through borrowing time from the giant's breath, with embodied tension in her manipulation of the pendant. The final transformation where she draws "what she heard" shows earned change through specific struggle, though some interior passages lean toward abstract ("she sculpts time itself with strokes most cannot even name").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught time manipulation building to Resonant Reconfiguration when the proto-echo's release transforms the city's soundscape ("every balcony sang the words last spoken upon it"). Cost is legible in the cracked stylus and emptied seconds, with the giant turning disrupting the established order. Minor orientation wobble with the giant's introduction feels slightly late.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system functions as active constraint forcing Eira to time her journey between breaths, while the "courtyard sized like a raindrop" creates vivid spatial impossibility. Setting directly enables the central action through water corridors and the whirlpool cage. Some passages drift toward the abstract ("time wore no skin there") without sufficient grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the borrowed-time mechanism: first disrupting the city's cadence (bells stopping mid-peal), then requiring more seconds to maintain the corridor, culminating in the stylus cracking as resources deplete. The giant turning "on his side" shows environmental consequence, though the middle section could tighten the cost of each borrowed moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between imprisonment and freedom, with the proto-echo's release questioning whether cities need "delayed voices to measure distance." The final image of lines fluttering with "uninterrupted cadence that belonged only to freedom" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature in phrases like "rain began, soft as eraser crumbs" and the illustrator's lens coloring descriptions ("sketching chronology like charcoal lines"). Some register elevation in abstract passages ("the ur-sound every later echo merely imitated") slightly strains the POV's naturalist perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong imagistic density in "rooftops rose like overlapping shelves" and "silver threads weaving between towers," with varied sentence rhythms matching scene pressure. Several abstract constructions slow momentum ("she sculpts time itself with strokes most cannot even name," "time wore no skin there") and the phrase "interrupted cadence" appears four times without sufficient variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time manipulation through borrowing seconds from a sleeping giant's breath, with the proto-echo concept offering non-obvious angle on urban sound. The infinity symbol's "impossible perspective" and water corridor "beyond ordinary geometry" take calculated risks that heighten stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
