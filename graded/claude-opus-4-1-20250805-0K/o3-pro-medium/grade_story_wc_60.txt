<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aurin's luminous skepticism manifests through concrete actions—doubting maps while using them, seeking physical proof through the moon shard. His motivation intensifies from curiosity to urgent mission as winter approaches, with the final choice to release memories carrying visible cost (the fountains' "defiant hush" honoring silence). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("luminous skeptic whose eyes glowed with questions").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: breadcrumbs → Novara → argent thread discovery → geese manipulation → fountain restoration. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost (centuries of silence broken, city transformed). The sidereal patience pays off when Aurin waits for fountains to find their rhythm. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the quest mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dry fountains and corroded valves constrain Aurin's choices throughout, forcing creative solutions (using geese to bring rain). Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("waterless lullabies," "black slate" river). The catacomb of pipes and collapsed mains create physical obstacles that shape tactics. Missing 9+ because while environment constrains choices, it doesn't fully charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to city-wide restoration with clear time pressure (winter deadline, geese migration). The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—faces concrete obstacles requiring protagonist agency (finding Novara, solving the water problem, manipulating weather). Cost is visible when fountains awaken with "defiant hush," honoring what was lost. One meaningful tightening when rust has "soldered the box to iron."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between skepticism and belief, memory and forgetting, with the fountains embodying collective loss. The "defiant hush" of restoration honors both remembrance and silence. Subtext operates through Novara's warning about bearing memories. The final image of memories roaming "freely with water" offers resonant answer without stating moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent limited third-person with controlled psychic distance and distinct perceptual signature ("realistically imaginative," measuring time by geese). Dialogue carries subtext effectively (Novara's whispered warnings). Some elevated diction occasionally strains POV credibility ("sidereal patience," "municipal neglect") but voice maintains coherence through pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density high in descriptive passages. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("luminous skeptic whose eyes glowed"), some abstract phrasing ("municipal neglect"), and slight register drift into elevated diction that doesn't always match the adventure-quest tone. No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of urban fantasy and memory preservation with specific details (stained glass box imprisoning fountain memories, using migrating geese as weather-makers). The solution—manipulating bird migration to bring rain—feels earned through established world logic. Some familiar quest-narrative bones prevent higher score, but execution transforms the template through specific imagery.</comment>
