<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotions through heartbeat dialogue and physical gestures (bow tension, trembling). Elaine's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to risk treason. The internal conflict between fear and certainty ("suspecting the kingdom would brand her traitor tomorrow, yet certainty bloomed beneath fear") lands with authentic complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where mechanical gives way to organic. The closure lands with visible cost ("brand her traitor tomorrow") and the before/after is legible through sap replacing oil. Minor orientation delay (Lio appears late) but doesn't harm closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mechanical orchard with "gears and copper roots" that "ticked like clocks" constrains choices throughout. Living statues enforce silence, creating spatial pressure. The locust shell becomes environmental tool charging the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal risk to systemic transformation as heartbeat dialogue enables coordinated rebellion. The statues' confusion and cracking ("cracks vein-lit their pristine chests") shows tangible opposition breaking down. Cost is explicit: "brand her traitor tomorrow."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the locust metaphor of "breaking free" without stating morals. The final image of "fresh wind tuned itself to the resonantly soft afterring of defiance" offers a non-literal answer about beauty's return through risk and connection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with musical metaphors threading narration ("her bow slicing air like a lantern carving tunnels through dusk"). Clean focalization holds through Elaine's POV with brief, justified glimpses of Lio. Prose rhythm accelerates during climactic transformation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly lands ("bow slicing air like a lantern carving tunnels") though occasionally dense. Information density high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition of "resonantly soft" but it's the required attribute.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical dystopia with musical resistance through heartbeat communication. The specific detail of "coolant replaced lifeblood" and statues as enforcers transforms familiar rebellion tropes. Risk-taking with the non-verbal coordination heightens stakes.</comment>
