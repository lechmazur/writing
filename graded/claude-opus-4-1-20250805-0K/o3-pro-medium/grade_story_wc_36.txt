<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kalen's motivation to "harvest insights from failure" drives consistent choices throughout, with his obsession creating the story's central irony when he discovers his future self as the thief. The internal contradiction between seeking redemption and being consumed by the same obsession that will cause his failure creates genuine complexity. Minor deduction for the resolution feeling slightly too neat when the vision-Kalen simply "paused, lowered his theft" without more embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through "avalanchingly quiet," driftwood markers, and the flute's resonance until the corridor scene delivers a Decisive Change where Kalen prevents his future self from stealing. The cost is legible in "grit cascaded from the saddle" and the transformation from driftwood to obsidian markers. Slight deduction for the mechanism of changing timelines feeling under-explained given the story's otherwise grounded texture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The canyon setting actively constrains choices through "air rattled thin as tin foil" and the specific acoustics of "two canyons crossed, their throats forming a natural ampitheater for silence." The transformation of driftwood markers to obsidian slivers charges the final image with environmental specificity. Sensory detail like "frost dust rose from crevices like startled spirits" integrates setting with the supernatural shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure from the physical climb to the metaphysical corridor opening, with Kalen's agency driving each step. The cost appears in "each failure mirrored a different choice" and the revelation that his obsession creates the very failure he seeks to understand. The final transformation where "the corridor rewove" carries visible consequence in the changed markers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of Kalen's drive to understand failure becoming the source of that failure, avoiding explicit moralizing. The shift from "minor lament to tentative major" in the flute melody embodies thematic resolution through action. The final image of obsidian pointing "back toward home" resonates as a non-literal answer about accepting rather than fleeing failure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with purposeful compression in phrases like "avalanchingly quiet" and "perfect breadcrumb bones" that create texture without obscuring meaning. POV remains stable with perception filtered through Kalen's guardian expertise noting "acoustically damp fabric" and security details. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation like "ampitheater for silence" that slightly exceeds the established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, particularly in "Air vibrated; frost dust rose from crevices like startled spirits, yet no echo returned." Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for figurative density in places like "mountains aligned like teeth around a swallowed word" and occasional elevated diction ("couloirs," "saddle") that creates minor register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of a guard discovering his future self as the thief offers genuine originality, transforming the time-loop trope through specific character psychology. The "avalanchingly quiet" paradox and driftwood-to-obsidian transformation create memorable specificity. Risk-taking in the metaphysical corridor sequence heightens stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
