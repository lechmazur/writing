<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Irida's motivation to translate overlooked histories through light drives consistent choices from acquiring the lens to dissolving it into "pure direction." Her internal experience layers concrete sensory detail ("salt breeze," "roaring surf") with embodied weight ("bent her knees"). The final renunciation—giving up the physical fragment to become direction itself—carries visible cost in her physical strain and the "queue of future errands."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered translations (light→painting→dissolution). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the fragment dissolves into "pure direction" and a child feels the lighthouse has "moved home," with cost visible in Irida's bent knees under "the weight of future errands." The persistent constraint of translating the untranslatable shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The alchemist's market suspended on rope bridges creates immediate spatial pressure, with characters climbing "beyond the last tarpaulin" to reach starlight. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("shivering rooftops," "prismatic ghosts"). The fragment's light constrains choices—becoming Aven's "only lamp" and requiring elevation to "the sky's deeper water" for completion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal acquisition to cosmic responsibility as Irida realizes "every overlooked history she had yet to carry" waits at "dawn's border." The deepening occurs through accumulation: fragment→painting→sky projection→dissolution, with each stage narrowing options. Cost manifests physically ("bent her knees") and conceptually (the fragment must be surrendered to complete the work).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of translation as preservation—"the lighthouse never failed, only changed address." The final image of a child knowing "without knowing how" that the lighthouse "moved home" offers resonant answer without stating a moral. Light-as-language and the fragment dissolving into "pure direction" reweight all prior translation work as transformation rather than capture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature filters everything through Irida's translator-consciousness: bridges are "threaded like veins," light holds "dialects," foam speaks "in colors." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, pulling close for the fragment's touch then widening for cosmic vision. Dialogue between Irida and Aven carries subtext about their shared history and complementary roles ("you are the ink that remembered").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs: "rope bridges...swayed above the shivering rooftops, threaded like veins between chimneys and moonlit laundry" establishes setting, atmosphere, and organic metaphor simultaneously. Some figurative density in peak beats ("anchors of intuition" appears three times) but serves the accumulative pattern. Prose rhythm accelerates through shorter segments as the fragment dissolves.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of translation-as-light with lighthouse-as-mobile-beacon creates a non-obvious conceptual framework that feels inevitable by closure. Risk-taking through the lyric accumulative structure and dissolution of the physical into pure direction heightens stakes. The specific detail of translated myths as "payment weightless yet binding" and paintings that "smuggle translations back to the unexpecting" transforms the translation conceit.</comment>
