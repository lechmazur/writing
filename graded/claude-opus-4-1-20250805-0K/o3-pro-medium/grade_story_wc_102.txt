I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and meditation toward a conceptual repricing about unused love.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lysander's spiritual curiosity drives concrete actions through the camera obscura ritual, with his past-life memory providing consistent motivation. The internal journey from seeking a "storage place" to understanding love as a dispersed field shows genuine transformation with cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "pilgrim of sparks" and the slightly convenient revelation structure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural structure coheres well, building from the viaduct setting through the camera ritual to the conceptual repricing that unused love "seeds the dusk." The closure lands with felt cost as Lysander releases his stored regrets as sparks. Orientation anchors effectively by line 2, and the past-life revelation integrates smoothly into present action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct creates atmospheric pressure while the camera obscura and Kwan Yin's Tear function as concrete tools constraining the ritual. Sensory details like "wisteria petals drifted like mauve snow" and the stone arches transforming from "ribs" to "open arms" mirror internal states effectively. The setting actively shapes choices through the specific location and ritual requirements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—deepens through the camera ritual's revelations about past lives and withheld expression. Pressure builds through breathing techniques and the projection's painful visions. The transformation from seeking a vault to understanding love as a dispersed field provides meaningful deepening, though physical stakes remain modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete journey: unused love as accumulated potential that can heal others when released. The final insight that love "seeds the dusk so others may navigate grief" avoids moralizing while offering resonant wisdom. The recurring lantern imagery and the transformation of the viaduct from bones to arms reinforces meaning without heavy-handedness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lyrical voice maintains consistency with phrases like "mist clung to the twilight viaduct in bloom" establishing a meditative register. Some elevated diction ("foggy lucidity," "spiritually curious heart") occasionally strains but mostly serves the contemplative tone. The perceptual signature focuses appropriately on light, breath, and transformation, though some passages edge toward purple prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, but several instances of overwriting: "corridor of lanterns floating in his chest," "pilgrim of sparks," and abstract phrases like "the echo admit it has always been a voice." Some template phrasing appears ("Soon," "Now," transitions). Information density is moderate; several passages could be tightened without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The camera obscura as portal to past lives offers a fresh angle on memory and regret. The specific synthesis of photography, Buddhist imagery, and breath-work creates an original meditation on love's afterlife. The transformation from seeking storage to understanding dispersal feels earned, though some metaphysical elements lean toward familiar spiritual territory.</comment>
