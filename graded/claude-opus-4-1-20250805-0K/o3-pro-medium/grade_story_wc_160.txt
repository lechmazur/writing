<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "harmonize conflicting values" drives concrete choices throughout, particularly her negotiation with the volcano itself and the calibrated gate opening that saves the orchid farms. The "encrypted compassion" as internal driver creates genuine complexity without diagnostic label-speak. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract framing of "matter and spirit could destabilize or steady each other" which briefly pulls from embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with escalating volcanic pressure that culminates in Mara's successful harmonization—a Resonant Reconfiguration where "conflicting values had not vanished; they had only been tuned into rough consonance." The cost is visible in her physical trembling and the acknowledged temporary nature of the solution. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraphs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The volcanic amphitheater functions as active constraint—steam patterns reveal pressure nodes, basalt gutters guide Mara's understanding, and the surveyor's chain becomes both measuring tool and conductor. The setting directly shapes tactics when "fissures crawled toward the audience terraces" forcing immediate gate adjustments. Sensory detail effectively balances sulfurous air, volcanic mist, and tactile metal throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Escalation builds through two distinct pressure surges—first requiring the gate opening that saves the orchid farms, then the deeper tremor that tests Mara's resolve and forces her whispered negotiation with the mountain. The cost manifests in "sweat mingling with ash" and her delayed trembling once danger subsides. Stakes remain coherent: prevent volcanic destruction while establishing sustainable harmony.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete negotiation between "containment against release, fear against mercy" without explicit moralizing. The final image of children tracing Mara's "footprints like fresh cartography toward shared survival" offers resonant closure without stating a thesis. Slight deduction for the abstract phrasing of "matter and spirit" which briefly distances from embodied particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice employs technical precision ("sluice gates carved in bedrock," "numeric pulses along her wrist receiver") that suits Mara's engineering expertise while maintaining lyric touches like "Steam curled over volcanic stone, rising like forgotten hymns." POV remains stable throughout. Minor repetition of "the building breathes" works as intentional pattern but slightly dulls impact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose maintains strong momentum with varied syntax and purposeful technical detail. Information density is high—most sentences advance both action and atmosphere. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("dappled resolve hanging in sulfurous air") and slight overwriting in metaphorical density during high-pressure moments. The "building breathes" repetition, while intentional, creates minor template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of engineering precision with mystical negotiation ("whispered a slyly heartfelt apology to the mountain") offers fresh angle on human-nature harmony. The blank maps readable only through volcanic mist and adhesive patterns provide specific innovation. The encrypted compassion concept meaningfully transforms the typical disaster-prevention narrative into something more nuanced about sustainable coexistence.</comment>
