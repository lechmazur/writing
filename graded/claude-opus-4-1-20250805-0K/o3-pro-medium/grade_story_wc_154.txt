<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The translator's internal conflict between professional neutrality and emotional investment drives authentic choices, particularly in decrypting the cast messages and delivering hope. The transformation from "nobody noticed" to active meaning-maker is earned through concrete actions with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "lotus-hearted ache" that briefly slips into therapy-speak, though it recovers through embodied detail.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (cast messages forming "REGROW") that reweights meaning at closure through the delivered sentence and coral fragment return. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as the narrator carries "a sentence, a fragment, and a map of echoing hearts" into ongoing conflict. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and causality holds as each discovery builds toward the final stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as sanctuary space that enables the crucial decryption work, with vapor and vines creating necessary isolation from the ward's groans. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (condensation beading in coral grooves, plaster falling on shoes during shellfire). The brain coral's labyrinth pattern constrains and enables the central metaphor of regrowth, directly shaping the final realization.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal mission ("graft new meaning onto old wounds") through discovery of the acrostic to the shellfire interruption that tests resolve. The dominant stake—finding language that can heal rather than merely translate—tightens when the narrator realizes the task is mediating "between frightened hearts." Cost is visible in the "lotus-hearted ache" and the acceptance that words might fade while patterns hold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the coral/regrowth metaphor without didactic statement, culminating in "Let what was broken remember its pattern, and build again together." The acrostic discovery feels earned rather than convenient, and the final insight about patterns outlasting words offers genuine complexity. The story resists tidy resolution while maintaining thematic coherence through concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled lyricism ("Salt wind licked," "mist-clad atrium") that intensifies appropriately during discovery moments. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("lotus-hearted ache," "narcotic fog") but mostly serves the reflective tone. The perceptual signature—focusing on silence, textures, and fragments—remains consistent and character-specific throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some abstract phrases ("unknot more than vines," "thread one fragile sentence through hearts") momentarily slow momentum. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor template cadence in mid-section ("I came here to... My actual mission... Words sometimes...") but recovers for the closure sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a translator finding healing language through a child's cast messages offers fresh perspective on war-zone narrative. The coral-as-memory metaphor avoids cliché through specific grounding in the fragment's grooves and the acrostic discovery. While the setup isn't wholly original, the execution through accumulated voices creating unexpected meaning shows genuine ingenuity.</comment>
