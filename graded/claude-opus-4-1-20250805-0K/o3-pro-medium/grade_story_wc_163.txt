I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to find "the rhythm of belonging she had misplaced" drives coherent choices through the burnt feather ritual and data harvest. The shared exhale with Lio creates embodied connection without therapy-speak. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of "belonging" until the city's harmonics make it concrete through "Belong, the city sang, belong as coastline belongs to surf."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where Mara and Lio achieve belonging "to both sky and sea." The burnt feather's placement creates the keystone moment that unlocks the city's memory, with visible cost in leaving the feather behind. Orientation anchors (underwater facility, Dr. Calyx, bathysphere descent) establish cleanly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drowned city functions as active setting—its "anemones whispering softly ingenious currents" guide movement, the mosaic's Leo alignment matters causally, and bioluminescent shrimp respond to breath. The feather constrains choice when Mara must leave it behind. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's astrologer perspective: "algal lanterns flickered like distant galaxies."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding belonging) escalates through the sunrise deadline creating urgency, then the city's awakening raises emotional stakes. The choice to leave the feather represents genuine sacrifice with "sensing the feather might belong here more than with her." Agency drives the harmonics discovery and data harvest decision under time pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the city's sung wisdom "belong as coastline belongs to surf, as orbit belongs to tide" without moralizing. The feather's journey from surface wildfire to underwater keystone creates non-literal resonance. The final image of ascending "belonging at last to both sky and sea" reweights the opening descent without stating meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature with Mara seeing constellations in coral and Lio's pragmatic "Thought nobody remembered this place." Lyric compression works: "Tears floated from Mara's cheeks like pearls." Minor deduction for slight voice convergence in shared moments and some elevated diction ("velvet precision") that occasionally drifts from character lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "releasing stale kelp smells and a hush of shadowseam wonder." Some figurative density in peak beats ("spectral strings," "luminous respite") without clear pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears briefly ("She knelt...She gathered...She returned") but doesn't pervade. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underwater archaeology with celestial navigation creates non-obvious angle. The burnt feather as carbon signature keystone and the shared exhale calibrating projectors show specific invention. Risk-taking in lyric mode and the choice to leave belonging incomplete ("No, but belonging is rhythm") avoids safety middle.</comment>
