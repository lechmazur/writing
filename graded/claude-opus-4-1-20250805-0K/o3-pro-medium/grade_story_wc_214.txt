<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Janus's spiritually curious nature drives genuine transformation from janitor to "silent abbot," with his empathy for broken stars mirroring his own vulnerability. The final choice to heal both glass and sky shows contradictory impulses (protocol vs. wonder) acting in scene with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("tender faculty," "flourishing stillness") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases from routine cleaning to cosmic choreography, with the lantern glass repair serving as Resonant Reconfiguration that transforms both Janus and his understanding of his work. Cost is visible in "his own fissures knit in sympathetic resonance" and the permanent change to how he performs his duties. The closure lands cleanly with "the universe...answered with a hush of primal elegance" reweighting all prior sweeping.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The station setting constrains choices effectively—the observatory vault, telescopic apex, and vacuum hatch all enable specific actions that drive the resolution. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("saffron light flooded," "starlight flooded his face," "charged ions"). The tracking station's accumulation of meteor dust over decades creates meaningful world-logic that supports the thematic fusion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from routine cleaning to cosmic healing through Janus's agency, with the dominant stake (finding strength in vulnerability) tested when he chooses empathic choreography over protocol. The cost is legible in his transformed relationship to his work and self. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as each discovery deepens meaning rather than reversing direction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between broken stars and Janus's vulnerability, with the final image of the universe answering his broom strokes offering resonant closure without stating a moral. The recurring motif of sweeping transforms from menial labor to cosmic participation. Strong thematic integration through "two small acts carving meaning from bleakness."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shows Janus noticing spiritual dimensions others miss ("leftover light tucked itself in corners"). Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm that supports the accumulative structure. Some elevated diction ("primal elegance," "flourishing stillness") occasionally drifts from the established register but serves the piece's mythic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks, with strong moments like "Vacuum howled beyond the field, yet inside the hatch a stillness bloomed." Abstract phrasing clusters in places ("tender faculty," "flourishing stillness," "sympathetic resonance") create mild opacity. Information density is generally high with most lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor as spiritual seeker offers fresh perspective on familiar archetypes, with specific synthesis of menial labor and cosmic significance. The transformation of cleaning into choreographic healing shows authentic vision. The piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative mode without retreating to conventional plot mechanics.</comment>
