I'll evaluate this story systematically through the lens of immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens**: Causal - the story operates through clear because/therefore linkages as Mara investigates, discovers evidence, and exposes corruption.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to expose Havel is clear and drives concrete choices (following voices, recording testimony, pursuing evidence). Internal conflict between protocol and curiosity manifests in action ("Curiosity fought protocol, and curiosity won"). The entangled memories provide unique texture but remain somewhat abstract; emotional embodiment could deepen.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with Decisive Change - Havel's corruption exposed, his influence "cracked like brittle glass." Causal linkage strong: investigation → discovery → evidence → exposure. Cost is visible in the systemic danger Mara confronts. The entangled memories subplot enriches but doesn't fully integrate with the corruption plot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices - flooded tunnel, fallen conduit, hidden chamber. Sensory details ("wet iron and hesitant electricity") create atmosphere while the underground railroad lantern bridges past/present meaningfully. The dry chamber discovery strains physical logic slightly but serves the narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from investigation to rescue to evidence discovery. The worker's trapped state creates immediate pressure; finding the ledgers transforms personal investigation into public accountability. Cost visible in the worker's injury and systemic corruption exposed. One meaningful tightening achieved.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths/systemic corruption emerges through concrete discovery. The lantern's historical memories create resonance between past and present struggles for freedom. Final image of vigilance flowing after drought works but the connection between supernatural elements and corruption theme could be tighter.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice distinctive with noir-inflected observations ("Assurances are bargains with chaos, and chaos keeps receipts"). POV stable, perceptual signature clear in cataloging dangers and empirical observation. Dialogue minimal but functional ("Cuts weren't my idea"). Some elevated diction ("anachronistic imprint") slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose generally propulsive with varied sentence structure. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("Light spiraled under, illuminating a low arch"). Clarity occasionally sacrificed for style ("fortified vulnerability and rising fury"). Information density high but occasional abstraction ("entangled memories tugged with sorrowful insistence") dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle combining noir investigation with supernatural historical memory. The underground railroad lantern as conduit to past voices offers originality. Synthesis of corruption expose with historical justice themes creates thematic depth, though the supernatural element feels somewhat grafted rather than essential.</comment>
