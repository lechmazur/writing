I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece that builds through lyric density, pattern recursion, and a final resonant reconfiguration where Quillan's act of measuring and archiving the revealed vow transforms his guilt into something he can "archive" - a Resonant Reconfiguration with emotional cost.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Quillan's meticulous nature drives every choice, from measuring silence frequencies to transcribing the vow's waveform. His guilt and the transformation of that guilt into something archivable shows genuine internal contradiction. The "gently meticulous care that had once failed his sister" lands with earned emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Quillan archives his guilt into "a shape he could archive." The accumulative lens holds as details layer (measuring, counting, cataloging) until the vow's revelation reweights his entire practice. Cost is unmistakable: "the one ledger entry that might have kept Lyra from wandering into a blizzard alone."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen library setting constrains every choice - from the need to work "while illusions fade to memory" to the "crystal tuning fork" revealing the catalog void. "Shelves of rime-veiled codices curved like frostbitten constellations" creates immediate atmosphere. The environment actively shapes tactics and the final archival act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake - completing the inventory/filling the void - escalates from routine measurement to confronting buried trauma. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as silence frequencies lead to the projection. However, Quillan faces limited external opposition; the conflict is primarily internal discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and loss, measurement and meaning. The final image of Quillan "walking back to his shelves" after archiving his guilt offers a non-literal answer about how we process grief through ritual. "Counting was a liturgy" establishes this early, paid off when he archives the vow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout - Quillan experiences the world through measurement and cataloging ("ticking distances on a tarnished brass caliper"). The lyric compression serves the piece's accumulative design. Voice maintains consistency even under emotional pressure when viewing his sister.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong prose density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The frozen library above the clouds drifted in a quartz hush" establishes setting, tone, and isolation simultaneously. Some elevated diction ("rime-veiled codices," "prismatic hieroglyphs") occasionally strains but serves the otherworldly atmosphere. Information density remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of a magic lantern revealing unspoken vows feels fresh, particularly when integrated with the archivist's compulsion to catalog everything. The specific synthesis of grief, measurement, and memory creates originality. The transformation of guilt into something archivable offers genuine insight about processing loss.</comment>
