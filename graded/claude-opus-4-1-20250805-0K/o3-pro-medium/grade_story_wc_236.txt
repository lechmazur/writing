<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amira's internal contradiction between grief and stubborn wonder drives authentic choices throughout, particularly in her sensory adaptation from smell to texture/sound. The final choice to help Laleh test the cannibalized clock shows earned agency with visible cost (the sacrifice of the water clock). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("emotional terrain" repeated without full embodiment) and occasional therapy-speak ("resolved to keep unveiling them").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens coheres as sensory details and craft metaphors build toward Amira's realization that "absence could funnel perception, not drain it," a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (the sacrificed clock, her ongoing grief). The closure lands with Amira drawing a new map "not of fragrances but of the morning's emotional terrain," showing adaptation with visible price. Deduction for slightly abstract cost articulation and some causality softness in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The water clock repair shop functions as micro-setting with gears ticking "like gentle raindrops" and fog creating a "cocoon of possibilities," constraining Amira's work through limited visibility. Sensory selection reflects her POV shift from smell to texture/sound effectively. Deduction for some generic atmospheric elements ("mist clustered," "fog-laden morning") and occasional vagueness in spatial choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake of restoring purpose after sensory loss escalates through the birthing clamp crisis, forcing Amira to sacrifice the water clock and discover new forms of perception. The cost is visible (cannibalized clock) but the escalation feels somewhat predetermined rather than genuinely pressured. The midwife's urgency creates external pressure but Amira's internal conflict doesn't sufficiently tighten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of reading between lines of lost senses, culminating in "absence could funnel perception, not drain it." The water metaphor (clocks, rivers, tides) creates coherent subtext about flow and adaptation. Minor deduction for occasional abstract statements ("ordinary miracles") and the slightly neat resolution of doubt being "turned free."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Amira's synesthetic translations ("smelling with her ears," "textures spoke in subtle Morse"). The prose modulates effectively from meditative opening to urgent repair work. Dialogue between Amira and Laleh carries appropriate subtext and urgency. Minor deduction for occasional filter verb clusters and some repetitive phrasing around "emotional terrain."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong moments of sensory precision ("blackened, delicate, threaded more finely than any clock pin") and effective rhythm variation. However, abstract phrases recur ("emotional terrain" appears 3 times, "ordinary miracles" twice) creating mild loops. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("valleys of loss, peaks of stubborn wonder, rivers where scent memory once flowed") without full payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of aromatherapist-turned-clockmaker finding sensory substitution is fresh and specific. The birthing clamp's generational significance adds authentic stakes. The transformation of loss into expanded perception avoids easy resolution. Deduction for some familiar workshop phrases ("trembling calm," "reading between lines") that aren't fully transformed.</comment>
