<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eren's internal journey from duty-bound dock worker to freedom-seeker is coherent, with the scrimshaw's power creating genuine tension between his sealed heart and others' opened ones. The final transformation ("water shaped to a man") feels earned through accumulated pressure, though some transitions between internal states lack embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the whale's call catalyzing a Resonant Reconfiguration where Eren surrenders control to find freedom. Cost is visible in abandoning his landlocked life and accepting impermanence ("the island breathed once more, turned translucent"). The closure lands with "combative tenderness between leaving and arriving," though the mystical elements occasionally strain causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sublittoral setting with kelp ribbons and barnacled pilings creates tactile immediacy, while the disappearing island's physical logic (existing "only in surrender") constrains Eren's choice meaningfully. The black-sand shoals and pearl terraces provide specific texture, though some transitions between physical states could be clearer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from stillness to whale song to the island's appearance contingent on surrender. The cost manifests in Eren releasing "every chore, every quota" to access the island, with the final dissolution ("slipped beneath the bright skin of the ocean") foreclosing return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of freedom-through-surrender emerges organically from the scrimshaw's paradox (unlocking others while Eren remains sealed) to the island's conditional existence. The ending's "combative tenderness" between opposing states offers resonant complexity without stating a moral, particularly in how "tenderness could fight by refusing to wound."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines maritime specificity ("bollards," "gunwales") with lyrical compression ("muscles flowing like rope"). The prose maintains coherent distance while modulating effectively under pressure, particularly in the surrender sequence where syntax loosens to match Eren's release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive prose with varied sentence structures and strong maritime vocabulary. Information density is high throughout, though occasional abstract phrases ("tidal animal beneath his ribs") could be more concrete. The final image effectively recharges earlier motifs without loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Quietening premise (violence becoming impossible) creates fresh stakes, while the scrimshaw's specific power and the island's surrender-based physics offer non-obvious angles. The synthesis of piracy-turned-theater with freedom-through-dissolution feels earned and avoids template resolution.</comment>
