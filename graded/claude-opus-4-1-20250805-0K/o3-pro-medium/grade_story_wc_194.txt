<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Iria's internal conflict between serving her employer and independence creates genuine tension, with her final choice to pocket the cylinder showing clear moral complexity. The "dynasty ender" characterization earns its weight through concrete action rather than label, though the emotional cost of her decision could be more viscerally embodied in the final beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Earned Stasis—Iria's refusal to deliver the evidence forecloses revolution with visible cost ("ash rarely thanked its sweeper"). The causal chain from searching to discovery to moral choice holds cleanly, with the gramophone mechanism providing concrete stakes that pay off in her final decision to preserve rather than destroy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sepia reading room functions as more than backdrop—its "golden shadows," hidden fresco, and gramophone cage constrain Iria's search and enable discovery. The setting's sensory hierarchy reflects her archivist expertise, though some figurative language ("shadows stretched like thoughtful cats") edges toward overwriting without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from finding evidence to confronting its implications—the fraudulent charter that would "evaporate" the dynasty. The moral calculus between truth and chaos provides genuine pressure, though the conflict remains largely internal without external opposition testing Iria's resolve in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of dangerous knowledge emerges organically through Iria's choice to carry truth "in bone rather than broadcast in brass." The final image of the silent record "waiting for the next curious hand" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the opening's promise of dynasty-ending with mature ambiguity about revolutionary cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent close-third POV with distinctive diction ("braille-like ridges," "standing waves"), though occasional register drift ("telegraph," "algorithm") strains the period voice. The narrative stance effectively modulates between lyrical observation and tighter focus during discovery, with no dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While individual sentences show craft ("Handle met spindle; metal kissed metal"), the prose suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence deploys figurative language, creating exhaustion rather than momentum. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She rose...She slipped...She turned"), and some metaphors strain clarity ("bridge of intuition, step by shimmering step").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of musical cryptography storing dynasty-ending secrets offers fresh specificity, transforming the archive-heist template through concrete detail. The story commits to its premise of sound-as-revelation, though the execution occasionally privileges style over narrative clarity.</comment>
