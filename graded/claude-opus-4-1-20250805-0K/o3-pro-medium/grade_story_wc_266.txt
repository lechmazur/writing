I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward Lis's retrieval of "unused courage."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lis's internal journey from "unfinished resolve" to claiming courage is earned through concrete imagery (the leather lanyard, star-punched ticket, unlit lantern). The contradiction between her need for courage and her willingness to undertake the journey creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for the guides reading more as mystical facilitators than fully realized characters with their own stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lis retrieves her courage from the ridge's clearing of abandoned leashes, with the lantern's ignition marking the decisive moment. The accumulative structure builds through ferry crossing, ridge ascent, and return, each phase deepening the metaphor. Cost is visible in the "rusted buckles" and "snapped chains" that mark others' transformations, though the personal price Lis pays could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway functions as both literal setting and metaphorical space where "unused courage waits," constraining Lis's journey through fog and forking paths. The harbor's "tide hushed against wooden pilings" and the ferry's "muted indigo hull" create atmospheric texture. The clearing with its "scatter of collars, ropes, and snapped chains" charges the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from harbor departure through "detours curved like question marks" to the ridge's forking paths where "every choice a whisper." The dominant stake—finding courage after breaking free—intensifies at the clearing where Lis must wait in stillness. Cost appears in the image of abandoned restraints, though Lis's personal sacrifice beyond time and uncertainty could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The leash metaphor resonates throughout: from Lis's "leather lanyard" to the clearing's "scatter of collars" to the realization that "every leash dies so that a creature might remember the sky." The ending reweights the opening's "unfinished resolve" as Lis watches "new constellations blossom inside the punched stars," suggesting internal transformation without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("boats swayed, their ropes drawing soft creaks that measured time more kindly than any clock"). The prose maintains its elevated register consistently through Lis's journey. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("she sought to find where unused courage waits"). Minor deduction for occasional drift toward abstraction in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative imagery, though some metaphorical density obscures momentum ("mist slid over the gunwales, wrapping Lis in damp vellum"). The piece occasionally loops conceptually, particularly around the courage theme. Several sentences could be tightened without losing atmosphere. The "gloaming" and "vellum" vocabulary feels slightly precious for the established voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The central metaphor of courage waiting at sites of broken leashes offers a fresh angle on transformation narratives. The ferry guides as psychopomps and the star-punch creating constellations in invisible tickets show imaginative detail. The piece commits to its lyrical mode without retreating to conventional plotting.</comment>
