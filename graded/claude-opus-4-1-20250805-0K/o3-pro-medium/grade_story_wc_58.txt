<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong characterization through Peregrine's unique profession and Princess Selene's haunting method of "projecting presence" while her body remains static. The final choice to write her living obituary carries genuine cost—both characters risk vulnerability. Contradictory impulses play out when Selene vacillates between material presence and projection at departure ("stepped away while her body lingered only a heartbeat longer, as if deciding which to keep").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens dominates—the piece builds through descriptive layering and metaphorical resonance rather than causal turns. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Peregrine discovers "my own healing had already found its first coordinate," reweighting the entire exchange. Cost is felt through Selene's vulnerability and isolation. Minor orientation delay (princess appears late) but doesn't harm closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The garden setting constrains the intimate encounter, with frost, skeletal oak, and dying roses mirroring emotional states without heavy-handed symbolism. The carpet thread functions as micro-setting that enables the final connection. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from garden to bench to departure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes center on being truly seen versus disappearing—"explained absences were considered worth more than unspoken grief." Pressure builds through Selene's request intensifying from obituary to "map the places inside her that might yet heal." The thread exchange creates tangible cost. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of writing obituaries for the living and the "geography of healing" metaphor that structures the piece. The final line "my own healing had already found its first coordinate" offers resonant closure without moralizing. Subtext operates through Selene's projection method and the thread's intimacy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through lyrical compression ("harbor emptied like a drained heart") and consistent metaphorical register. POV remains controlled with clear perceptual signature—Peregrine notices decay, absence, and unfinished stories. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("Pull this through every line you write").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"Wind scuttled dry leaves across marble, sounding like distant applause for a play no audience would witness." Some elevated diction ("lonesome splendor," "anticipatory elegies") but voice-consistent. No loops or scaffolding, strong propulsion throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle on memory and presence through the "obituaries for the living" concept and Selene's projection ability. The geography metaphor for healing transforms expected emotional territory. Specific details like "frost-stiff rose" and "carpet weft thread" avoid generic atmosphere.</comment>
