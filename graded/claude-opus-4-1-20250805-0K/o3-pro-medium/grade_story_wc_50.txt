I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered echoes and sensory details toward a resonant reconfiguration where stored wonder returns to the village.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's patient listening method and decision to "store wonder in the cellar of reason" establish clear motivation that drives his descent and experimentation. His contradictory impulses (locksmith precision vs. waiting for echoes) act simultaneously in the cavern scenes. The final choice to release stored wonder into the town clock shows earned transformation with visible communal cost—neighbors regain "ordinary awe" but the price is accepting mystery over explanation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully—the mended timer storing echoes transforms the town clock into a vessel for recovered wonder, with visible cost in the "wounded season" healing. The accumulative structure coheres as each echo experiment builds toward the final synthesis. Minor orientation wobble around "peripherally focused" but the pattern teaches itself through repetition and pays off in Silas's final smile.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The marble cavern functions as more than setting—its echoing properties enable the core mechanism of harvesting sound to mend both timer and season. Sensory details ("pillars of pale stone caught every spark") serve the accumulative pattern. The dawn/noon/dusk light angles creating different echo pitches shows environment constraining method effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation reads through density increase—from valley-wide silence to personal quest to cavern experiments to communal restoration. The stakes deepen when Silas realizes echoes can heal the season's wound. Cost becomes tangible when neighbors must accept unexplained wonder rather than demanding how it works.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically through the locksmith metaphor: "a good lock is never about closing; it is about knowing how music waits on the other side." The harvest of echoes becomes literal method and metaphorical restoration of wonder. The final image of Silas carrying "music that could fit in his palm and open whole seasons" resonantly answers the opening silence without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with distinctive perceptual signature ("peripherally focused, like a moon glimpsed only at the edge of vision"). Compression and elision ("Hours dripped away") serve the accumulative mode. No dialogue keeps focus on interior perception and sensory work, appropriate for this meditative piece.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density generally high with lines doing multiple jobs ("Each tick harvested an echo, folded it into the coil"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("bruised the sky," "soft map of sound") but serves the lyrical mode. Template cadence appears briefly ("He filed...melted...let") but doesn't pervade. The "peripherally focused" repetition feels purposeful rather than looped.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmith-as-listener with echo-harvesting feels fresh and specific. The concept of storing wonder in mechanical memory through cavern acoustics offers a non-obvious angle. Risk-taking in the lyrical compression and indirect narrative approach heightens resonance without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
