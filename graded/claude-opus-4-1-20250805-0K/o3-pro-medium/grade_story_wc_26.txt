I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and metaphorical density toward a resonant reconfiguration where the narrator accepts unresolved metamorphosis as a form of hope preservation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "preserve the shape of hope for strangers" drives the sacrifice of the password coat, with Eira's parallel quest for her grandmother creating genuine emotional stakes. The choice to remain in the library while Eira descends shows clear cost through the irreversible charter restriction. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "luminous regret" that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where accepting "unanswered frames to unfold in silence" reweights the entire quest from recovery to allowing metamorphosis. The cost is visible in the narrator's permanent separation from the ground world and acceptance of incomplete transformation. The accumulative lens holds as imagery layers (river stones, shadows, dusk) build toward the final crystallization of hope as process rather than product.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blooming library with "glass roots drinking sky light" and "flowering folios that breathed perfumed pollen of paragraphs" creates a vivid setting that constrains choices through the charter rule. The telescopes blooming alongside dictionaries and the desk grown from intertwined quills make the environment actively shape possibilities. The reservoir viewed as "a dull coin lost in autumn grass" grounds the fantastical in concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from archival comparison to active quest when the shadow appears, then heighten with Eira's revelation about her grandmother. The charter restriction creates genuine cost when Eira must descend alone. The final acceptance that "preserving hope sometimes means allowing unanswered frames" shows earned transformation under accumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the interplay of forgetting/remembering, with the grandmother's metamorphosis "when the valley forgot her name" resonating against preservation efforts. The river stone holding "possibility, or perhaps with forgiveness" and the final acceptance of incomplete metamorphosis create layered meaning without stating a moral. The recurring dusk imagery accumulates into "keep noticing dusk" as both instruction and philosophy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "a coat stitched from obsolete passwords," "scented inkwells dew-dropped from leaves." The perceptual signature of noticing gestures that "sought permission from unseen editors" establishes character-specific observation. Slight register elevation in places ("luminous regret thickened") but generally maintains coherent texture through pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong imagery density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The librarian, a sharp-eyed dusk noticer named Eira" introduces character, required element, and atmosphere simultaneously. Some abstract phrasing ("luminous regret," "shape of hope") occasionally replaces concrete imagery. The "shadow unbound" repetition works as pattern but borders on overuse. Clean prose rhythm supports the lyrical mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of a library above clouds with "glass roots drinking sky light" offers fresh perspective on archival preservation. The metamorphosis through forgetting rather than remembering inverts expected dynamics. The specific synthesis of film reels, river stones, and shadow transformation creates an inevitable-feeling logic unique to this story's world.</comment>
