<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's "preemptively nostalgic longing" drives her methodology and shapes her final choice to excise her own yearning from the record, creating genuine cost. The internal contradiction between preservation and petrification manifests concretely when she chooses humility over ego. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("raw matter of a collective memory") in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through layered memories toward Lira's decision to omit herself—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost ("The omission stung"). The piece teaches its lyric pattern early with "Mist drifted like unspoken questions" and pays it off when "darkness archive[s] her footsteps." Minor deduction for slight orientation delay regarding the exact nature of her archival task.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt functions as active setting that constrains choice—Lira must press her quill to stones to hear their stories. Environmental details like "moonlight pooled inside the fracture like milk in a cracked cup" charge the final image. The observatory's descent "just above memory" transforms space into conceptual territory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from measuring shadows to discovering the broken sundial to the flood of faces demanding selection. The stake—what fragments to carry forward—tightens when Lira realizes "If she misjudged, some era might vanish." Cost lands clearly when she excises her yearning, though the middle section could apply more pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and petrification, crystallizing in Lira's choice to create "space for future voices to bloom where her ego might have rooted." The final image of the forecourt "folding her decisions into the vault of dawn" offers resonant closure without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("quills, plucked each solstice from migrating birds, trembled"). Perceptual signature clear in how Lira experiences the observatory through archival consciousness. Minor register elevation in places ("raw matter of a collective memory") slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("lightning stitched apertures in cloudbanks"). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats without full payoff ("the raw matter of a collective memory greater than any chronicle"). Minor abstract phrasing ("identity from experience") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival work with mystical elements creates non-obvious angle—archivists who literally catch experience before it bruises. The concept of "preemptively nostalgic longing for events still unfolding" offers genuine originality. The broken sundial pooling moonlight transforms expected imagery.</comment>
