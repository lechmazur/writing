I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is a Causal story - events follow because/therefore linkage as Serah discovers the sundial's secret, meets Aldren, and executes their plan to free prisoners through electrical manipulation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Serah's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (counting steps, manipulating the sundial), with her "calmly inventive" nature shown through problem-solving under pressure. The story loses points for lack of internal contradiction during the crucial decision to proceed with the revolution - she experiences no visible doubt or cost calculation when committing to mass prisoner release.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from blackout to discovery to execution, with clear closure as doors open and prisoners disperse. The cost is primarily implied through "footfalls dispersed like migrating birds" rather than viscerally felt - we see the successful revolution but not what Serah personally sacrifices or risks, weakening the closure's emotional weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fort Lumen's setting actively constrains choices through the blackout, hidden sundial mechanism, and electrical infrastructure that enables the plan. The "stained-glass corridors" and "spiral stairs" create spatial coherence, while the quartz shards and bronze holder function as micro-settings that drive the plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (freeing prisoners through electrical manipulation) escalates from discovery to planning to execution, with the blackout creating genuine complication. However, the resolution lacks visible resistance or cost - the plan works perfectly without meaningful opposition or sacrifice, reducing tension at the climactic moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of silent revolution emerges organically through action rather than statement, with the lattice lightning serving as both literal and metaphorical illumination. The final image of doors "saluting the vigilant lock sentinel" resonates, though the piece could deepen its exploration of freedom's cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical language ("twilight glazed," "captive suns," "winking hush") that maintains consistency throughout. The perceptual signature shows Serah's technical mindset through precise counting and angle calculations, though dialogue between Serah and Aldren could carry more subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong prose rhythm with varied sentence structures and purposeful figurative language that advances the story. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting ("rumour insisted that no latch born of iron could ignore her whisper") and some template phrasing in the middle section, but information density remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of using stored lightning to trigger a prison break through electrical systems shows originality, as does the sundial-based conspiracy mechanism. However, the revolution-through-technology premise follows familiar patterns, and the lack of meaningful opposition or moral complexity prevents higher scoring.</comment>
