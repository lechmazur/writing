<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's receptivity to riddles and innovation drives credible choices throughout, with her decision to nurture the dangerous seed despite knowing its risks showing clear internal conflict. The final image of her feeling "every unlocked tomorrow begin to turn" lands as earned stasis with visible cost—she accepts the uncertainty and danger for creative possibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and metaphors of locks/puzzles accumulate toward a resonant reconfiguration where Maren commits to "mystery, once solved, must regenerate or perish." The seed's rapid germination creates genuine pressure that forces her stance crystallization, with cost visible in accepting the coming "musk" and professional risk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The workshop setting with its "gears, locks, and riddled sculptures" constrains choices effectively—Maren must work with available materials (terrarium, brook water) to nurture the seed. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, particularly the interplay of storm-silence, brook murmurs, and anticipated corpse flower stench that shapes her design thinking.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The seed's unexpectedly rapid germination ("minutes earlier it had been intact") creates escalating pressure that forces Maren from contemplation to immediate action—adjusting vents, planning ducts, documenting growth. Her agency drives every response, with visible cost in accepting the professional risk of incorporating "a stench that stopped thought" into her business.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of seeds/locks/puzzles as forms of potential requiring risk—"Innovation did need hush...a quiet in which new mechanisms could click without judgement." The ending's "every unlocked tomorrow begin to turn" resonantly answers the question of creative risk without moralizing, reweighting earlier material about "orthogonal approaches" as necessary for innovation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent free indirect style with distinctive perceptual signature—Maren notices everything through the lens of puzzles and mechanisms ("sounded storm-born," "like moving gears half-heard"). Some elevated diction ("interstice where puzzles negotiated with dreams") occasionally strains but rhythm effectively modulates with pressure, particularly in the accelerating final third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting appears ("nocturnal haven," "velvet hush"). The recurring lock/puzzle metaphors maintain coherence without becoming strained, and sentence variety creates effective rhythm. Minor scaffold in phrases like "she mused" and "she realized" but momentum remains strong through the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of an escape room designer receiving a corpse flower seed offers genuine freshness—the paradox of incorporating repulsive elements into entertainment transforms both professions. The specific synthesis of "scent over sight, decay over shine" as design principles feels non-obvious yet inevitable, with Maren's "orthogonal approaches" philosophy grounding the risk-taking.</comment>
