<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like the dance-cipher and dice placement, with internal contradiction between her former role and current rebellion. The confrontation with Dr. Vane crystallizes her transformation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("encrypt vulnerability as strength") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught dance-language that pays off at the vault and in the final confrontation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira gives Vane the die, reversing their power dynamic with clear cost (the laboratory's destruction, her burning lungs). The "spider spins its web" motif effectively brackets the piece.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory constrains choices through flooded corridors, algae-slick stairs, and structural collapse that forces upward movement. Sensory details like "pallid lights flickered...steady as a tired heartbeat" and "luminous plankton that painted corridor walls" are purposeful. The setting actively participates in closure through the final collapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from infiltration to data liberation to laboratory destruction, with each phase narrowing Lira's options. The dice's dual function (authorization then trap) creates meaningful reversal. The confrontation with Vane forces a choice between revenge and mercy that lands with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the dance-as-language metaphor and the inversion of vulnerability/strength without explicit moralizing. The dice transformation from execution tool to liberation device resonates. The final image of Lira floating while "the world would change slowly...as a spider spins its web" offers a non-literal answer about patient resistance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("I am Lira, lyrical code breaker"). The dance-language concept is taught early and paid off. Some register elevation in places ("pallid lights," "corroded steel") slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon but doesn't harm clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("ocean pressed above like an enormous memory"). The "as a spider spins its web" repetition works as taught pattern. Minor template cadence in middle sections ("I approached...I placed...I whispered") but doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dance-cipher concept offers fresh specificity, transforming the heist genre through embodied choreographic hacking. The hangman's dice repurposing and the reversal with Dr. Vane avoid predictable confrontation. Some elements feel slightly assembled but the synthesis coheres.</comment>
