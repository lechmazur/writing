I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density builds through lyric repetition and image accumulation toward the final transformation of dust into story-carriers.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mila's motivation as stubborn preserver of language is clear and consistent, driving her quest through concrete micro-choices (tracing masonry, copying lyrics, conducting dust). The transformation from copyist to resurrector of stories feels earned through accumulated detail, though some interior states could be more embodied rather than declared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from radio discovery through lyric decoding to dust animation, with clear cost (exhaustion, risk from regime). The closure—dust carrying stories as spores through everyday sounds—achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with visible transformation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The post-famine world where "libraries became barns and pages became tinder" creates vivid constraint. Specific details like "rosin-scented fingers," "sheet-metal roofs," and "hollow instrument cases turned into birdcages" build texture. The ember alcove and hidden antenna function as micro-settings that enable key discoveries and constrain Mila's actions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from finding the broadcast to teaching dust to carry stories, with the regime's "hounds of silence" providing pressure. The deepening occurs through accumulation—each discovery builds toward the final transformation where stories embed in everyday sounds. Cost manifests as exhaustion and risk, though middle pressure could intensify.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the survival of language despite censorship, with dust as burned books gaining voice. The final image of "silence [that] had learned to hum in perfect tune" offers resonant non-literal answer to how stories persist. Subtext operates through images like "contraband gulls" and "carbon ghosts" without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines musical terminology ("metronome," "tuning A," "overture") with poetic compression ("ember alcove in mist," "thistled calm"). POV remains consistently close third with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature shows Mila experiencing the world through musical/textual frameworks, though some phrases edge toward purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves lyric density with lines doing multiple jobs ("dust was listening" carries both literal and thematic weight). Some overwriting appears ("vowels soft as moss," "syllables wobbling like candleflame over a draught") but rhythm generally supports accumulative structure. Information density is high, though occasional metaphor mixing ("contraband gulls") slightly muddles clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of dust as story-carrier after a "story famine" offers fresh angle on censorship narratives. Specific synthesis of musical notation with pirate broadcast mechanics feels original. The transformation of everyday sounds into story-carriers provides non-obvious resolution, though some dystopian elements feel familiar.</comment>
