I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration where unused love transforms from stored to circulating.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to find and release unused love is clear and consistent, driving concrete actions through psychometry. Internal experience is embodied through specific gestures (pressing frame to brow, trembling hands). However, she lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle - her journey proceeds too smoothly without meaningful resistance or cost to her personally.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure building from physical exploration to metaphysical discovery, with the projection scene creating resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands with conceptual cost - unused love must circulate rather than be stored. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3. Deduction for abstract conceptual work that occasionally loses concrete grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The projection booth setting actively constrains and enables the central action - the projector, film strip, and theatrical space are essential to the mechanism of release. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (hushed thunder, phosphorescent ink, dusty balconies). The environment directly shapes the resolution through the projector's hidden tune.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding/releasing unused love) is clear from line 6. Escalation occurs through deepening discovery - from touching film to projecting images to releasing love into circulation. However, lacks genuine opposition or meaningful obstacles; Mira's journey proceeds without significant resistance or personal cost beyond "trembling hands."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete imagery - unused love as paused breath, letters as wallpaper, the projector's mechanical drone hiding melody. The final insight that love "preferred circulation" over storage resonates without moralizing. Strong metaphorical coherence throughout, though occasionally tips toward the abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("hushed thunder prowled"). Perceptual signature is consistent - Mira experiences through synesthetic imagery (corridors of light, phosphorescent ink). POV remains stable without leakage. Minor deduction for occasional drift into elevated register that slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong sentence-level craft with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery. Information density is high - most lines advance atmosphere, character, or concept simultaneously. Some figurative density in peak moments ("motes of freed affection swept past her ribs") but maintains pattern coherence. Minor repetition of "hushed thunder" bookending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry with cinema creates an original mechanism for exploring unused love. The specific combination of crystal gazer in projection booth reading film strips is non-obvious and memorable. The conceptual metaphor of love needing circulation rather than storage offers genuine insight beyond surface novelty.</comment>
