I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds density through layered imagery and temporal perception rather than strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Quillon's retrocognitive burden drives authentic internal conflict as he experiences time's dissolution through embodied perception ("photographs developing in reverse"). His final choice to become the garden's axis emerges naturally from his designer's pride and chronological obsession, with visible cost in permanent isolation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully as Quillon becomes "the silent curator," accepting eternal stasis to preserve time's texture. The accumulative build through hyperbolic geometry, photographic visions, and the halo fragment's expansion creates legitimate pressure toward this crystallized ending where cost is explicit: "If he left, the maze would disintegrate and time with it."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The living bridge garden functions as both setting and antagonist, its hyperbolic geometry constraining Quillon's movement and forcing his designer expertise into play. Sensory precision ("moss slick planks," "ivy wrapped his ankles like respectful serpents") makes the fantastical space tactile, while the garden's breathing responsiveness elevates it beyond backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the garden's recursive resistance and Quillon's deteriorating mental state ("edges of his thoughts blurred"). The hyperbolic maze creates genuine pressure by multiplying wrong choices into infinite corridors, forcing Quillon to apply his professional knowledge sideways—literally "walking off the page of normal geometry."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between design/control and time's organic flow, culminating in Quillon's transformation from maze designer to living axis. The final image of him "designing pathways for wandering seconds" resonates without stating its meaning, reweighting his professional identity as eternal service.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical precision throughout ("mist quivered," "breathing spine") with controlled metaphorical density that serves the fantastical premise. Perceptual signature remains distinct—Quillon experiences reality through architectural and photographic frames ("chalking invisible lines," "negatives of his mind").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The bridge bent over an abyss of mist, yet living vines sprouted along its curve, forming corridors"). Some elevated diction ("retrocognitively trapped," "Euclidean logic") fits the premise, though occasional abstraction ("texture of time itself") slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of maze design, temporal perception, and hyperbolic geometry creates genuine originality—particularly the solution requiring Quillon to use non-Euclidean movement. The concept of a designer becoming his own creation's axis transforms the familiar trapped-in-maze trope through specific professional knowledge and temporal cost.</comment>
