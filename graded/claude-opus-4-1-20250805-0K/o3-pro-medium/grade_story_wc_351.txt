<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhea's "helix-minded" engineering mindset manifests through concrete actions—tracing fractures as coordinates, growing circuits rather than soldering them—with her internal conflict between fear and curiosity driving the choice to follow the mirror's projection. The transformation from excavator to custodian lands with visible cost: accepting that she cannot possess the memories but must guard their migration back into the collective.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered imagery (spider-web cracks, fiber-optic nerves, entangled memories) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Rhea accepts custodianship rather than possession. The cost is legible: she must abandon her original goal of archaeological ownership to become a guardian of "the fragile gate," with the mirror continuing to record as proof that "dreams, once found, refuse to remain silent."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon functions beyond decoration—its "natural amphitheater where basalt columns rose like organ pipes" provides the specific space for the final vision, while the canyon's shadows "flickering like pages" mirror the story's memory-excavation. However, some descriptions lean ornamental ("trembling curtains of possibility") without constraining choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The central tension between excavating/possessing versus cataloging/releasing builds through Rhea's interaction with the mirror, with "fear brushed her thoughts, but curiosity pushed harder" marking the pivot. The cost materializes when she must accept custodianship over possession, though the escalation could be sharper—the transformation happens smoothly without significant resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The archaeological metaphor coheres throughout—from "fossil" technology to "sedimentary truth" to the final museum vision—with the theme of abandoned dreams gaining resonance through concrete imagery rather than declaration. The ending's shift from ownership to witnessing ("not as owner of the change, but as its witness") emerges from accumulated particulars, though some passages edge toward abstraction ("algorithms rewrote their own ethics").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with Rhea seeing fractures as "coordinates on a star chart only she could see" and consistent POV control throughout. The prose rhythm modulates effectively—shorter fragments during discovery ("Fear brushed her thoughts") expanding into longer contemplative sentences for the vision sequence, though occasional elevated diction ("haunted corridor of earth") slightly strains the engineering mindset.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density varies—strong passages like "She unpacked a coil of fiber-optic nerves, circuits she had grown rather than soldered" doing multiple jobs, but weaker sections rely on abstract descriptors ("profound transformation," "quieter revolutions"). Some metaphor strain appears ("helix-minded," "lightning-borne intuition") and the phrase "quaking reverie" repeats without evolution, creating mild redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of technology-as-memory-vessel offers a fresh synthesis, particularly the grown circuits with "synaptic plasticity" and the periscope mirror that remembers what it sees. The transformation from military surveillance tool to dream archive, combined with the specific detail of "translating photons into braille-like code along her palm," creates genuine originality within familiar sci-fi territory.</comment>
