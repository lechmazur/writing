<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jarom's synesthetic gift drives genuine internal conflict between preserving his unique perception and creating devices to warn others. The forge's price—losing chromatic hearing—creates visible cost through his graying world. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("battered marvel") but the sacrifice lands with embodied weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as Jarom gathers absences that build toward the forge's revelation. The closure—trading chromatic hearing for betrayal's sound—lands with clear cost as colors drain to "gray thuds." The Resonant Reconfiguration works: he gains the warning note but loses the gift that guided him.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sunken orchard with floating pears and aurora ribbons creates vivid, purposeful atmosphere. The forge's "gray sparks swirling like dust motes" effectively visualizes memory. Setting constrains choice through the diving bell and underwater navigation, though some descriptions lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking betrayal's sound to risking his synesthetic gift at the forge. The accumulation of absences (locket, compass, violin) builds pressure toward the price extraction. Cost is legible as colors fade during ascent, though the middle gathering could tighten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox that "absences, too, could bloom into warning." The final image of Jarom standing "poorer in senses" but richer in purpose resonates without moralizing. The concept of harvesting voids to reveal sound by outline is conceptually fresh.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled metaphors ("pears floated like lantern grubs"). Some elevated diction ("cracked blessing," "battered marvel") occasionally drifts from character specificity. POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature through color-hearing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("thin stem snapping beneath unexpected weight") but suffers from abstract phrases ("battered marvel," "paradoxical bloom"). Some redundancy in describing the forge's process. Line "While cells divide unseen within his own trembling hands" feels inserted rather than organic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of hearing colors and forging silence into warning devices offers genuine originality. The sunken orchard greenhouse with shipwrecks creates a memorable, specific world. The transformation of absence into presence through the forge mechanism feels earned and conceptually striking.</comment>
