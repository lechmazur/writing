I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through layered imagery, bird-language liturgy, and the gradual transformation from battlefield to garden rather than through causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation crystallizes through concrete actions—translating bird calls, mapping nutrient streams, and performing "avian liturgy"—rather than internal exposition. His transformation from passenger-ferrier to ecological healer emerges through embodied choices with visible cost (the empty carriage seats now "holding only breeze"). The character's specialized knowledge (reef-Latin, barnacle-Greek) drives meaningful action, though some interior states remain abstract rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where battlefield becomes garden and the coachman's empty carriage fills with metaphorical passengers ("every seat held only breeze"). The accumulative structure coheres as bird-language enables fertilization, leading to visible transformation: "green spears already pricked through the mud." Cost is legible in the reef's death breaking the millennial accord and the soil "drunk on salt and sorrow." The lens holds consistently though orientation anchors arrive gradually.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint throughout—the dead reef's absence creates "iron-flat" waters, the salt-poisoned battlefield resists seeds, and bird calls map "invisible nutrient streams." The jetty, tide patterns, and coastal geography shape every tactical choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("rattled like timid bones," "soft as gauze"), with the environment directly enabling the transformation through phosphorus, shore bacteria, and brackish tides.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from passive seed transport to active bird-translation to orchestrating an "aviary parliament" that transforms the battlefield. The dominant stake—healing war-damaged land—deepens as each bird species contributes specific ecological functions (sandpiper's bacteria, heron's silt migration). Cost accumulates in the broken coral accord, the artillery-pitted meadow, and the coachman's solitary mission, though agency remains primarily observational rather than decisional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the submerged concord metaphor—land and sea's broken reciprocity mirrors post-war healing. The final image of petals "reciting the dead languages of peace" resonates without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the coachman's translation work bridging natural and human languages, while the empty carriage seats holding "only breeze" suggest absence made meaningful through ecological restoration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines archaic registers ("gloom-hill," "reef-Latin") with ecological precision ("trace phosphorus," "shore bacteria"). The perceptual signature is consistent—filtering everything through linguistic and ecological frameworks. Prose rhythm modulates effectively from meditative observation to active transformation sequences, though occasional register elevation ("aviary parliament he had subpoenaed") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions—"Seeds alone, however, could not awaken the bruised earth; the soil had drunk too much salt and sorrow" combines plot advancement, metaphor, and causality. Some elevated diction occasionally creates distance ("subpoenaed," "chlorophyll"), and there's minor repetition in the bird-calling sequences. Line-level craft is generally strong with varied syntax and purposeful paragraph structure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of ecological restoration through dead-language translation is genuinely fresh—transforming the typical post-war narrative through linguistic ecology. The "submerged concord" between land and sea offers a non-obvious angle on environmental healing. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and the choice to make language itself the restoration tool heightens meaning without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
