I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination**: This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density builds through layered images (butterflies, ribbons, poems) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. The monument becomes a crystallization of collective grief with visible cost in the community's recognition.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Len's "fiercely meditative" nature manifests through concrete actions—the weeks-long pilgrimage marking grief stations, working through three nights. The spectral mentorship with Mira adds texture without becoming pure fantasy. Minor deduction for the community's response feeling slightly generic ("felt lighter") rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the monument transforms private griefs into shared recognition. The accumulative structure coheres well—ribbons marking stations, butterflies as temporal markers, poems as emotional braiding. Cost is visible in Len's exhaustive journey and the community's recognition of their own grief. Slight deduction for the abstraction of "thundering calm" not quite landing with full weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse-as-dining-room detail enriches the setting beyond ornament. Butterflies on glass "like dull stars" creates atmosphere while marking time. The ribbon trail through the town creates a geography of grief. Environment constrains choice when Len must wait for butterfly migration's end to understand the monument's form.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rendering collective grief in stone—builds through accumulation rather than reversal. Len's weeks of retracing processions represent genuine effort with visible cost. The pressure coheres when Mira's "Listen to the ribbon" crystallizes his understanding. Slightly lower score as the escalation relies more on duration than intensification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the interplay of permanence (stone) and transience (butterflies, grief). "For everything that leaves, stay" resonates without moralizing. The trading of poems becomes thematic action, not just motif. The final image of "resonance welcoming every future sorrow" achieves genuine complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains a measured, contemplative register appropriate to the protagonist. "His silence was not emptiness but a fiercely meditative tide" establishes tone early. Dialogue is minimal but effective ("Retrace what has been loved"). Some phrases edge toward the overwrought ("dusk bled violet") but generally the prose serves the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance atmosphere or character. Some figurative excess ("spectral mentorship," "thundering calm") and occasional abstraction ("grief of a whole valley could be felt"). The phrase "thundering calm" appears three times, creating mild repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of a gravestone carver creating a monument for collective grief offers a fresh angle. The spectral mentorship could feel derivative but gains specificity through the greenhouse setting and glass reflections. The synthesis of stone permanence with butterfly transience creates an organic metaphor. Execution is thoughtful if not groundbreaking.</comment>
