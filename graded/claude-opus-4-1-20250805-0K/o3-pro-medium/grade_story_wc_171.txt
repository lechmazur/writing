I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through ritual significance, symbolic objects, and a pattern of weighted details that culminate in the treaty signing.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Petra's exhausted idealism and the delegates' specific physical/spiritual markers (brass limb, temple banners) create distinct presences. The water-drinking ritual reveals character through embodied action—Rourke spitting vs. Laure's benediction. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("bruise on her conscience") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through the ritual's completion and unexpected orphan provinces clause. The cost is visible—both leaders' resistance then capitulation, the "fraction of hatred" released. The accumulative pattern of ritual→negotiation→unexpected addition creates meaningful pressure that forecloses pure military solutions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terrace with "gold cracks that glimmered like tired constellations" and the ritual objects (helmet, river water, ebony clipboard) effectively constrain choices through ceremonial protocol. The setting actively witnesses and remembers ("terrace settles, as if ancient mortar exhaled"). Slight deduction for underusing the midsummer timing beyond initial mention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through ritual stages: water pouring→drinking→negotiating standard terms→Petra's risky addition of orphan provinces. Each delegate's different response to drinking (spit vs. benediction) reveals stakes. The final joint stewardship clause genuinely risks the fragile peace, with visible cost in their protests before signing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ritual's ancient code versus modern warfare's persistence, crystallizing in "flawed beauty is still beauty." The orphan provinces addition reweights redemption from military cessation to future-building. The clipboard's history (mentor's death) and the terrace's memory create resonant layers without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Petra's weary eloquence ("Gentlemen and seer, the terrace remembers every promise") maintains consistent formality. Some elevated diction fits the ceremonial context but occasionally drifts ("operatively gentle appeal"). The delegates' minimal dialogue feels appropriately terse, though more distinct voices would strengthen their presence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, especially in ritual moments. However, several abstract constructions weaken immediacy: "title felt like an unhealed bruise," "eloquence for artillery silence," "shield capable of deflecting history's accusations." The "tomorrow and tomorrow again" echo works but borders on ornamental.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The water-drinking ritual as binding diplomatic protocol offers a fresh angle on peace negotiations. The specific detail of different responses (spitting vs. benediction) adds originality. However, the war-weary negotiator archetype and the surprise humanitarian clause are somewhat familiar moves in peace negotiation narratives.</comment>
