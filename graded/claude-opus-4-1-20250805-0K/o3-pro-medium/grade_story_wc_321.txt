Looking at this story through the demanding editorial lens, I'll evaluate each category systematically.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Milo's resilient positivity drives concrete actions throughout, from polishing unused cleats to turning the hourglass that resolves the crisis. His motivation to "merge parallel timelines so no one missed home" emerges naturally from accumulated details. Internal consistency holds, though the shift from ordinary deckhand to timeline-weaver stretches slightly without more grounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Milo turns the hourglass and passengers solidify into chosen versions of themselves. The accumulative/textural lens coheres as pattern recognition leads to resolution. Cost is visible in Captain Rowan's tears for "birthdays never forgotten" and the foreclosed alternate timelines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The spectral grotto functions as more than backdrop—its luminous moss tears and trembling responses constrain and enable Milo's choices. Sensory detail like "snow hissed back, sounding like distant applause" creates atmosphere while advancing plot. The ferry's physical transformation through "overlapping outlines" grounds the fantastical shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from missing ferry to existential threading of timelines, with Milo's agency driving resolution through the hourglass. The dominant stake—reuniting fractured possibilities—tightens when passengers flicker between decades. Cost appears in solidifying choices that foreclose other versions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete imagery: "Everything important...was being threaded onto one glittering string." The concept of impermanence as "another form of arrival" resonates without moralizing. The hourglass transforms from empty vessel to "quiet tide clock no chart could predict," reweighting the entire journey.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "tides the way poets trust silence." POV stays firmly with Milo throughout. Some elevated diction ("permanent transient resolve") occasionally strains against the deckhand perspective, and dialogue is minimal, limiting character distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of excellence ("when clocks run sideways in the harbor's uncanny fog") but suffers from occasional overwriting. Filter constructions like "Milo felt" and "He understood" accumulate in key beats. Some metaphors stretch thin ("corridors of bone"), though line-level clarity generally serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of timeline-merging through maritime disappearance offers genuine freshness. Specific details like "pier numbers, even his mother's cramped handwriting" ground the fantastical. The resolution through knot-tying knowledge ("timelines are only ropes with stories woven inside") transforms the ferry worker archetype meaningfully.</comment>
