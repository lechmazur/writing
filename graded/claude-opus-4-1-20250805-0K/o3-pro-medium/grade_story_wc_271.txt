<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Anisa's trauma survivor identity drives concrete choices through somatic work with visitors, though her internal contradictions could be more viscerally embodied during the thunder moment. The relationship with Malik creates genuine pressure that forces her stance crystallization. Her final choice to store the photograph "not to hide pain but to store evidence" shows earned acceptance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through somatic stations, visitor responses, and the pearl metaphor's evolution to closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Anisa reframes ruins as light-focusing rather than grief-containing, with felt cost in "the horizon retained a faint line of cobalt." Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The arboretum's glass walls become somatic teaching tools that "trembled with wind," constraining visitor exercises. Sensory detail effectively narrows during Anisa's freeze moment. The shattered lighthouse lens below mirrors and charges the pearl-in-ruins image at closure, though some middle passages rely on generic greenhouse description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from solitary dawn walks to leading thirteen strangers through embodied calm while thunder triggers her own freeze response. The dominant stake—anchoring optimism in realism—faces concrete test when storm sounds echo the drone. Cost is visible when Malik's touch guides her "back into cadence," showing vulnerability's price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the pearl-in-ruins metaphor: "light could refract through ruins without pretending the ruins were gone." The somatic exercises embody rather than explain how bodies can "rehearse safety" in unsafe worlds. The final image of cobalt thread "strong enough to stitch tomorrow to today" resonantly answers the central question without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shows Anisa noticing "sick leaves before they yellowed" and experiencing panic as muscular commands. Brief dialogue ("I almost froze") carries enormous subtext. Minor convergence occurs when both characters stand silently at the balcony, though this reads as intentional emotional confluence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines like "gulls wheeling like loose gears above the shattered lighthouse lens." Some filter verb clusters appear ("Anisa watched," "knowing," "she pictured") but don't obscure closure. The "bruised purple" clouds and "silhouettes of questions" show controlled figurative language, though a few passages edge toward overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The somatic marker stations offer fresh angle on trauma recovery through embodied practice rather than talk therapy. The wedding survivor leading calm-mapping exercises inverts expected victim narrative. While drone strike weddings are familiar territory, the specific synthesis of horticulture, neuroscience, and cliff-edge vulnerability feels earned.</comment>
