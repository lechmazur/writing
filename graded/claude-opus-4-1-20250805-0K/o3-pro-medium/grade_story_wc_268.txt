I'll evaluate this story systematically through each category.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is a **Causal** lens story - events follow because/therefore linkages as Lysar's cryptic messages lead to doubt, which enables the confrontation, resulting in the pretender's exposure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong character construction with Lysar's paradox of physical smallness versus titanic presence effectively dramatized. The final choice to "sunder" carries visible cost as the court kneels "not in obedience but in self-preservation." Minor deduction for Selestine's somewhat rapid conversion to fervor without deeper internal conflict shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as a Decisive Change with the throne becoming "empty so it might be genuine again" and the shepherd child summoned - clear before/after with cost visible in the court's vertigo and the pretender's vanishing. Causal chain from messages to doubt to confrontation is solid. Orientation anchors arrive late but serve the mysterious atmosphere.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The temple library and Hall of Mirrors function as more than backdrop - the library's time-distortion enables Lysar's ageless vigil, mirrors multiply his presence and shatter to reveal truth. "Dust like incense in the blue dusk between worlds" establishes otherworldly texture. Setting constrains choices through the temple's isolation and the mirrors' revelatory properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from coded warnings to direct confrontation with clear tightening when "doubt crept like ivy toward the gilded throne." The rune of drift's effect on the proclamation narrows the pretender's options. Cost is visible in the court's "collective vertigo" and the pretender "stared at his own vanishing."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus illusion emerges through concrete action - mirrors revealing "separate possible histories," the empty throne becoming "genuine again." The rune of drift embodies the theme by making "thoughts slide sideways, revealing hidden layers." Final image of the shepherd child "bewildered yet luminous" offers resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive elevated register with phrases like "exhaled dust like incense" and "constellations gears lurched forward." Voice maintains consistency through mythic tone. POV control is clean with no head-hopping. Minor instances of slight overwriting ("architecture of looming calamity") don't touch closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied rhythm and purposeful compression. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs: "shelves rearranging imperceptibly, preparing for whatever truths would next require careful ink." Some elevated diction borders on purple ("verdigris," "ostentatious stationery") but serves the mythic register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a "diminutive titan" offers fresh paradox, and the rune of drift as reality-tilting device is inventive. The mirror-shattering climax revealing multiple histories transforms the throne-usurper trope. Combination of ancient library, time distortion, and cryptic messages creates distinctive synthesis.</comment>
