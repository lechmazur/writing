<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to find "mathematics of mercy" through trauma-induced synaesthetic perception is distinctive and embodied through concrete sensory details. The transformation from passive victim to active seeker of mathematical absolution earns its arc through visceral body memory and proprioceptive enhancement, though the final epiphany about mercy as "transformation" edges toward abstraction without fully embodying the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory intensification and mathematical revelation build toward a Conceptual Repricing—mercy reframed as reciprocal transformation rather than constant. The closure lands with the protagonist becoming "both variable and witness," though the conceptual cost could be more viscerally felt. Orientation anchors clearly (post-torture forest escape) and causality holds as enhanced perception enables the mathematical breakthrough.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest functions as more than setting—it's an active participant offering "sanctuary clauses older than their software" and responding to the protagonist's conductivity experiment. Sensory detail is exceptionally specific ("violet that flickered beyond the visible spectrum," "granular tremor beneath my shoulder blades") and the pewter strap becomes a tool for environmental interaction that enables the mathematical revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from physical survival (evading drones) to metaphysical quest (solving mercy's equation) with the forest clearing providing sanctuary that enables the mathematical experiment. The protagonist's agency drives the conductivity test that transforms "one divided by zero" into its reciprocal, though the resolution's abstraction ("willingness to invert power") slightly dulls the visceral cost of transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of mathematical proof—mercy not as sentiment but as equation requiring vulnerability to solve. The ultraviolet forest's "penance" becomes healing radiation through power inversion, avoiding didactic statements. The final image of carrying "mathematics of mercy in my bloodstream, luminous, recursive, unfinished" resonates without moralizing, though the abstraction "willingness to invert power" edges toward thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains exceptional consistency through synaesthetic perception ("tasting blood laced with anesthetic," "smell of ozone and the clack of shackles") and mathematical framing of trauma. The prose rhythm accelerates during the equation sequence and the perceptual signature—experiencing memory through muscle twitches and body responses—is distinctive and sustained throughout without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Memory returned not as images but as jerks of muscle"). Some abstract phrasing in the resolution sequence ("willingness to invert power," "transformation, dependent on") creates minor opacity, but overall the language is precise, propulsive, and free of loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fusion of mathematical proof with trauma recovery through synaesthetic forest communion is genuinely original. The specific detail of proprioceptive enhancement enabling coordinate awareness and the body "remembering through trauma responses it had cataloged" transforms familiar survivor narrative through unexpected scientific-mystical synthesis.</comment>
