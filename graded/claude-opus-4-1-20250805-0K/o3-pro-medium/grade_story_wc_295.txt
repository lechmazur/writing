I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered discoveries, dream fragments, and stellar observations toward a resonant reconfiguration where isolation transforms into communion.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation burns clear—decode inscriptions before they become weapons—and her grief over Ariston creates genuine internal tension. The choice to broadcast rather than hoard knowledge demonstrates character growth with visible cost (releasing control). Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("comprehension had become communal") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira transforms from isolated researcher to communal witness, with the cost of surrendering sole ownership of discovery visible on page. The accumulative lens holds as stellar observations, dream fragments, and replies layer into shared understanding. Slight deduction for the final paragraph's mild abstraction about "burdens grown feather-soft."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The observatory setting actively constrains choices (telescope mechanics, radio frequencies) and the pressed daylily functions as micro-setting that charges emotional beats. Sensory detail filters through Mira's professional lens ("brass eyepiece," "phosphor screen"). The temple inscriptions and stellar patterns create lived-in specificity that shapes the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to communal healing as Mira realizes Ariston's fatal flaw—denying shared burdens. The pressure deepens when she overlays star patterns onto inscriptions, forcing the choice between hoarding or sharing knowledge. Cost is visible when she broadcasts the warning, relinquishing control for collective understanding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the decoded verse "Carry the weight together, or be crushed alone" without moralizing. The final realization that burdens can "anchor or propel" adds complexity. The pressed daylily and variable stars accumulate meaning without forced symbolism, creating genuine resonance through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains scholarly precision mixed with lyric touches ("Midnight breathed quiet constellations"). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("spectral ink," "mutual endurance") but mostly serves the contemplative tone. The perceptual signature of a dream chronicler/astronomer holds throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of beauty ("sunset trapped in fiber") but suffers from abstract noun clusters ("comprehension had become communal") and some elevated register drift. Information density is generally strong. Notable template cadence in "She whispered... She understood... She broadcast" sequence deducts -0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of astronomy, dream chronology, and ancient linguistics creates fresh specificity. The concept of stellar patterns as "cosmic braille" and the observatory as "confessional, auditorium, and infirmary" shows genuine originality. The transformation of scientific observation into communal healing avoids predictable paths.</comment>
