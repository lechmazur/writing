<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mirelle's motivation to defy conformity's lullaby is clear and drives her decisive actions throughout. Her internal journey from waiting "between sigh and smile" to becoming the world's "first true listener" shows earned transformation with visible cost. The contradiction between her role as "chaste courtesan" and her revolutionary actions creates genuine tension, though some transitions lack embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain from rumor to seeking to transformation, with Mirelle's untangling actions creating irreversible change for the entire city. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully as the sanctuary transforms from hidden to manifest, forcing honesty through beauty with clear cost to the old order. The drive lens (Causal with Accumulative elements) holds consistently through closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The progression from silver courtyard through loom-rooms to prism sanctuary creates coherent spatial choreography that constrains Mirelle's choices. Sensory details like "threads clicked like distant teeth" and "breath frosted into fleeting vowels" are selective and purposeful. The sanctuary's transformation into "prismatic arcs, a new sky" charges the final image, though some middle passages rely on abstract description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—breaking conformity's hold on the city—escalates from personal quest to societal transformation with clear cost. Mirelle's agency drives every turn through concrete actions (cutting threads, speaking her true name, freeing the sanctuary). The pressure tightens as she descends deeper, with the final transformation showing visible price: "Conformity's lullaby faltered, for it required dull silence."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of liberation through listening emerges organically from Mirelle's actions rather than statement. The "harvest of echoes" concept pays off beautifully as "proof that silence was never duty," reweighting all prior material. The final image of Mirelle as "first true listener" offers a resonant answer without moralizing, though some middle passages edge toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice maintains a lyrical, elevated register appropriate to the fairy-tale mode with distinctive phrases like "bodily poetic presence" and "alarming serenity." POV remains stable with Mirelle throughout, though some passages drift into omniscient observation ("Court ministers craved its power"). The prose rhythm effectively modulates between contemplative and urgent beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in sensory passages like "threads of silk, gold, and memory hung in shimmering skeins." Some abstract phrases weaken momentum ("the sanctuary, freed from its underworld, now arched above"), and occasional register drift appears ("symbolic proof that force had never been the key"). No major loops or scaffolding, but figurative density occasionally obscures clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a hidden sanctuary that harvests echoes to unlock forgotten futures offers genuine freshness. The transformation of conformity's lullaby through untangling threads provides an organic, non-obvious synthesis. While drawing on fairy-tale conventions, the story transforms them through specific details like the "chaste courtesan" paradox and the final image of enforced honesty through beauty.</comment>
