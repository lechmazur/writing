<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orin's motivation to restore sacred practices through story and song is clear and embodied through concrete actions with the wilted tendril. The transformation from despair to renewal shows earned change with visible cost (sleepless nights forging, dismantling afterward). Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("tears carving clean lines") rather than fully embodied response in villagers.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase building to Resonant Reconfiguration where the vine blooms and the Arbor Heart awakens. Closure lands with visible cost (Orin's exhaustive preparation, the decades of blight) and the final image of him crafting future tales shows ongoing price. Slight deduction for predictable arc once the mechanism is established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The verdant arbor and mechanical elements (copper phonograph, tin constellations) effectively constrain Orin's remedy method. Sensory details like "fragrance of rain on stone" and "lambent light" support the transformation. However, the setting could more actively pressure choices; it mainly provides atmosphere rather than forcing specific tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (wilted tendril) through communal (villagers gathering) to cosmic (harvest moon alignment). The transformation moment when "rootlets stirring beneath their feet" shows meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in Orin's preparation and the decades of lost practice, though the resolution feels somewhat assured once the song begins.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of restoration through remembered wisdom emerges organically from the story-within-story structure and the vine's revival. The elder's line about remembering "the way the world once breathed you into being" resonates without moralizing. The final image of stories carried in tree rings offers a non-literal answer about cultural transmission.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with controlled rhythm suits the fable-like tone, though some elevated diction ("lambent," "verdant arbor") occasionally feels over-literary. POV remains stable with Orin. The embedded story about silver pumpkins demonstrates voice modulation, but dialogue is minimal and the elder's speech borders on thematic ventriloquism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, but several instances of elevated register drift ("gathering hush," "verdant arbor," "lambent light") that feel forced. Some repetitive phrasing around vines/tendrils. The density is high with most sentences advancing multiple purposes, though occasional overwriting in descriptive passages ("ribbons of dawn light").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical tinkering with organic restoration creates an original angle on the healing-the-land trope. The phonograph translating story to vibration is inventive. The specific detail of "silver pumpkins glowed like lanterns" and children tying prayers to stems shows authentic imagination rather than generic fantasy.</comment>
