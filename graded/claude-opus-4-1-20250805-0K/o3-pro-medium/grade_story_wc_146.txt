<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marek's cryptic patience and Lira's journey from cartographer to keeper show clear motivation, with the tuning fork transfer crystallizing a genuine change. The "infinitely patient" trait drives actual choices rather than remaining a label, though some interior states ("surprising herself") feel slightly unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with walking cadence building to temporal reversal—the town's restoration through rhythmic footsteps creates a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (Lira must stay and keep walking). The closure lands with "carry the interval" as both burden and gift, though the mechanism of time-folding could be slightly clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cracked plaza, ancient archway, and cobblestones function as active participants—the stones "remember" and "know," creating a lived-in world where setting constrains and enables the central action. The transformation from dead town to living market with "lights inside houses woke like eyes after fever" charges the final image perfectly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest ("maps that could be walked into existence") through the walking ritual to the choice between staying or charting ruins—with visible cost in Lira accepting the tuning fork's burden. The dominant stake of restoration coheres well, though the tension could tighten more dramatically in the middle section.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of walking as restoration, with the tuning fork's resonance literalizing "shared balance" without preaching. The final image of the town keeping time while they step forward offers a non-literal answer about continuity requiring active participation, avoiding any stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled compression ("Wind carried a wild hush," "shutters sighed and doors hung like spent tongues") that maintains consistency throughout. The perceptual signature filters everything through sound and rhythm, with dialogue minimal but effective ("The stones know your name").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("lamp posts flared, illuminating murals Lira had seen only in brittle sketches"). Some minor metaphor density in places ("doors hung like spent tongues") but the prose maintains strong momentum with varied syntax and no loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of walking a town back into existence through resonant footsteps offers genuine freshness, transforming the ghost town revival trope through specific mechanics. The tuning fork that "never rang unless stone and sky agreed" and the temporal folding create memorable specificity.</comment>
