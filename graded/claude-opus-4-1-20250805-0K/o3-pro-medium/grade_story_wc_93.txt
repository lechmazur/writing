Looking at this story through the lens of immediate publishability in elite venues:

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through pattern-making, symbolic accumulation, and cadence shifts rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aikan's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like placing stones and carrying star dust. The precognitive curse creates genuine internal conflict, though the emotional progression toward tears feels slightly rushed. His covenant with the eels provides consistent character logic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where friction's return transforms curse into guidance. The pattern-completion pays off the promise setup, and cost is visible in Aikan's tears and the permanent grooves. Early orientation is clear despite the fantastical elements.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The frictionless world constrains every action, from Aikan's sliding movement to anchoring stones by desire. Aurora interactions with stone placement create dynamic setting-as-participant. The tidal bluff and collapsed star dust function as active elements shaping choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through pattern-building where one misaligned stone would bring a "snarling" future. The dust's vibration and the eels' prime-number speech deepen pressure. Cost is legible in the permanent grooves and Aikan's shifted relationship to his curse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the covenant between herder and eels, exploring promises across time. The eel-biting-tail glyph and circular dancing create resonant closure without stating morals. "Miracles conclude by restoring the mundane" earns its wisdom through specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("auroras curled like silent harps"). POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Some elevated diction ("interstices like liquid geometry") occasionally strains but serves the mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and varied syntax, though occasional overwriting appears ("luminous columns that wrote sentences across clouds"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some abstract phrases like "hemispheres of the soul" lack grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eel herding, precognition, and friction-loss creates original worldbuilding. The mathematical stone sequences revealing migration maps across "hemispheres of the soul" transforms expected patterns. Risk-taking with the lyrical register mostly succeeds.</comment>
