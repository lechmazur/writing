I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece - density increases through recurring scallop imagery, moss/grotto symbolism, and the fig tree pattern, building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Maren transforms grief into generative action.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied characterization through concrete details ("hands still rough from decades") and the scalloped bandage gesture at closure. The internal conflict between forgiveness and its "hollow" plays out through specific actions. Minor deduction for slightly abstract "weight of forgiveness" and "echo of screams" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - Maren's transformation from seeking "the source" to actively "scalloping bandages" for incoming children, with visible cost in the silver fruit exchange. The accumulative pattern coheres well through scallop motifs. Slight opacity in the grotto's mystical mechanics prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The grotto setting actively constrains and enables transformation - the moss "exhaled," vines "recoiled," and the environment responds to choices. The fig tree functions as micro-setting that bookends the piece. Vivid sensory work ("damp earth and something older") throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal seeking to communal healing through the silver fruit exchange. The grotto test ("What do you seek?") forces stance crystallization. However, the mystical transformation lacks some concrete pressure - the "thread connecting every ending" remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the scallop pattern - from hairpin to shoot edges to final bandage cutting - embodying how "grief scalloped the edges of joy." The cycle of rebirth transforms from abstract concept to lived practice. Final image of waiting for children's laughter resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature with selective detail ("twilight just before stars remember themselves"). Voice maintains lyric consistency while modulating for the grotto's otherworldly register. Brief dialogue serves its purpose. Minor deduction for occasional elevation that strains ("forgotten breath").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm variation and high information density. However, some figurative density in mystical sections borders on opacity ("spiral, not a wound but a cradle"). Template structure in "She had climbed... She had forgiven..." creates minor cadence issue.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of monastic contemplation with magical realism, avoiding typical redemption arcs. The scallop motif as embodiment of grief's productive edges is original. The man releasing doves adds unexpected texture. Doesn't quite reach highest originality due to familiar grotto-as-transformation setting.</comment>
