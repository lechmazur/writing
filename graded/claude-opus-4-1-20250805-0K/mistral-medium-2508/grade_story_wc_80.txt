<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve hidden stories drives consistent action through the pavilion exploration and note exchange, with his "stoically sensitive" nature embodied in precise surveying paired with poetic grief. The final choice to continue as "archeologist of abandoned dreams" shows earned commitment with visible cost (his wife left him for this obsession). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("the ache in it") rather than fully embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered discoveries (note, Keeper's archives, final ledger entry) that reweight Elias's role from surveyor to keeper of stories. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he accepts his role with the Keeper's validation ("You'll know the right cracks by how they ache"). Cost is visible in his isolation and the wife who left. Deduction for slightly diffuse middle section that could tighten the accumulation pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion constrains action (water level, crumbling stone, limited access time before drawbridge lowers) and charges the final image through the recurring motif of cracks that "ache when you touch them." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (rust and old paper smell, algae-slick marble). The inkwell's violet ink from Persia adds specificity that matters to the exchange.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative lens: pressure builds through discoveries that deepen Elias's commitment despite personal cost (lost marriage, professional mockery). The dominant stake—whether connection across time justifies present sacrifice—tightens when he finds the Keeper's validation. However, the middle lacks a clear tightening moment where options narrow or costs escalate before the final archive scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus abandonment emerges through concrete actions (placing notes in mortar, trading inkwell for ledger) rather than statements. The final line about "aching cracks" reweights earlier repair work as emotional rather than structural. Slight deduction for the somewhat explicit "archeologist of abandoned dreams" phrase that edges toward thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shows Elias noticing decay with both technical precision and emotional resonance ("iron teeth locking the past in place"). Voice maintains consistency through pressure, modulating from methodical observation to dreamlike reflection. Minor filter verb accumulation ("He wondered," "He'd thought") in middle section prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("drawbridge groaned," "water lapped at the edges of his waders") with good rhythmic variation. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("the need to wrest meaning from what others abandoned" restates prior content) and some abstract phrasing ("interlaced absence was its power") reduces clarity. Template cadence in "He + verb" constructions appears in succession.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of hidden notes in architectural repairs offers fresh angle on preservation theme, with the Keeper correspondence adding temporal depth. The final revelation that cracks "ache when you touch them" transforms repair work into emotional archaeology. Somewhat conventional frame of lonely preservationist prevents higher score.</comment>
