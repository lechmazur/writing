<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with contradictory impulses (warmth of prism vs. cold bite of frost, belief in echoes vs. skepticism of ghosts). The final renunciation—hurling the prism—is earned through accumulated pressure and shows visible cost in "shoulders unknotting for the first time in years." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("terrible knowing") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (frost moving, prism glowing) that reweight meaning toward Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with visible cost—blood from cut palms, years of tension released. The orientation anchors (arbor, dawn, Elias) establish by ~60 words. Slight deduction for the ambiguous "some proofs were better left unproven" which feels slightly disconnected from the concrete action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quartz arbor and frost patterns constrain choice—Elias must read the frost to commune, and the prism's placement on the dashboard forces his final decision. Vivid sensory work ("skeleton of light," "fractured rainbows") filtered through mystic's perception. Deduction for some abstract moments ("liminal stretch") that don't fully ground in the physical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation through accumulative density: frost patterns → vision of woman → mother's face → prism glowing → forced choice. The cost is legible in cut palms and "shoulders unknotting for the first time in years." Minor deduction because the middle vision of the woman feels slightly disconnected from the final mother revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: objects absorbing emotions becomes literal in the prism's behavior. The final image of "settling of old debts" reweights the entire premise without stating a moral. Strong subtext in "some hushes were meant to stay shifted." Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract "truthful lies" concept that doesn't fully crystallize.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct mystic voice with selective perception ("measured silence in degrees"). Controlled psychic distance shifts from observation to vision to action. Some excellent compression ("truthful lies, memories distilled into sensation"). Deduction for occasional register drift ("liminal stretch," "terrible knowing") that feels slightly elevated beyond established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong opening and closing lines that bookend with transformed meaning. Information density high in descriptive passages. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("terrible knowing," "awful clarity of understanding") and some repetitive structures ("Elias didn't believe... but he believed"). Filter verb cluster in middle section ("feeling," "watching," "seeing").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh angle on psychometry through "shifted hush" and frost-reading method. The synthesis of inherited trauma and object-memory feels specific. However, the resolution (throwing away the burden) follows a somewhat familiar template. The risk-taking in lyric mode and non-standard communion method elevates within band.</comment>
