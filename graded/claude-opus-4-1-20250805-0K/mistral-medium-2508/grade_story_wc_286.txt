<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The potter's motivation through "phototropic to kindness" drives his return to the ruins and shapes his bowl-making ritual with the embedded glass. His internal conflict between seeing fractures vs. graveyard manifests through concrete actions (tracing bowl rim, following sun patterns, embedding the shard). The final realization that "resistance wasn't refusal. It was remembrance" feels earned through his patient craft and observation, though the emotional embodiment could be more visceral during key moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (bowl, glass, bee, honey scent) building toward a Conceptual Repricing where "resistance is remembrance." The cost is visible in the abandoned bowl left behind and his solitary return to the dying village. Orientation anchors (potter, abandoned oasis, dying world) establish by ~100 words, and the fractured timeline concept pays off through overlapping temporal perceptions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis functions as more than setting—it constrains choices through its ruins and enables the potter's craft through its "fractures where time had split." Sensory details (cracked earth, bleached wax combs, honey ghost-scent, pale gold dust) create a lived-in wasteland. The lantern glass shard becomes micro-setting that charges the final image when embedded in clay.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: the potter's search for kindness in ruins intensifies through the bee's arrival, the glass's warming thrum, and culminates in leaving the glowing bowl behind. The cost is legible in his solitary pilgrimage and the abandoned offering. Pressure coheres under the textural lens but lacks a sharp reversal or tightening moment that would elevate further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete image of the bowl with embedded glass—art preserving memory in ruins. The resistance/remembrance revelation reweights all prior material without stating a moral. The bee as messenger and the honey scent return create resonance. Subtext operates through the potter's actions rather than declarations, though some passages edge toward abstract philosophizing ("fractures: moments where time had split").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and perceptual signature ("phototropic to kindness," seeing "fractures" where others see graveyards). Free indirect style clean throughout. The single line of dialogue "Why here?" carries appropriate weight. Diction remains within the potter's artisan-philosopher lexicon, and syntax modulates with emotional intensity, particularly in the crystalline final movements.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the glass "thrummed faintly against his palm, a vibration not of sound but of memory"). Some elevated diction in peak beats ("sharp gentleness of the dying light") but it serves the piece's lyric mode. Minor repetition of "thrum" (4x) and "fractures" (3x) but purposeful. Clean grammar and varied paragraph structure support momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The fractured timeline concept offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic ruins, transforming wasteland tropes through the potter's unique perception. The bee as temporal messenger and the embedded glass as memory-holder show specific invention. The "phototropic to kindness" trait distinguishes the character. However, the post-apocalyptic potter-philosopher archetype, while well-executed, doesn't fully transcend its template.</comment>
