<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's internal contradiction between needing to remember and being forbidden to remember drives authentic tension, with the scales as embodied proof creating specificity. The final choice to weave stories for all lost twins shows earned agency with visible cost (the ship sinking). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("unkindled solace festered") that briefly slips into diagnostic territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the emerald swatch accumulating power through ink absorption to resurrect the sister, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora chooses to save all lost twins rather than just her own. Cost is visible in the ship's destruction and the weight of taking on endless rescue work. The orientation anchors (ship, fog, carnival) establish setting within the first paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The carnival ship functions as both setting and constraint—its mirrors serve as portals, the ledger provides the mechanism, and the fog transforms from barrier to door. The "garden of forgotten names" shifts from metaphor to accessible space, with sensory details (salt/cotton candy, black tears, crushed petals) supporting the surreal logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation: discovering the scales, finding the ledger, the swatch drinking ink, the sister materializing, then the revelation of other lost twins demanding rescue. The final choice to stay and save all carries clear cost (abandoning escape). One point where pressure could tighten further is the sister's materialization, which resolves too smoothly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of memory/erasure into physical rescue, with the garden evolving from abstract concept to actionable space. The ending reweights the personal quest into collective responsibility without stating a moral. The "unkindled solace" metaphor occasionally strains but the final image of fog as door rather than barrier resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric compression ("the garden wasn't a place") and selective perception focused on carnival Gothic details. Some register elevation in phrases like "blissfully aberrant" and "unkindled solace" that slightly exceed the POV's established lexicon. The perceptual signature of noticing decay and transformation is consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some metaphorical density in high-pressure moments ("unkindled solace had festered all these years—a hollow where her heart should have been") creates mild opacity. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple purposes. Minor template cadence in the final section with repeated "The [noun] [verb]" structures.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of carnival Gothic with twin mythology and memory-as-physical-space creates genuine freshness. The transformation of the swatch card from memory token to resurrection tool, and the garden from metaphor to accessible realm, shows non-obvious conceptual work. Risk-taking in the surreal logic pays off with coherent world rules maintained throughout.</comment>
