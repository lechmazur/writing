<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's telepathic intrusions create genuine pressure that forces the human's worldview to crack, with contradictory impulses (mission vs. emerging truth) acting simultaneously in scene. The human's transformation from assassin to participant feels earned through specific revelations, though the final helmet removal could use more embodied struggle to fully sell the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with cascading revelations that reweight the central premise—the city as planted rather than drowned, the "god" as child rather than monster. Closure lands with Decisive Change as the human drowns/transforms and the city rises, with visible cost in the lung-filling surrender. The foxglove repurposing from poison to pigment creates resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drowned garden setting constrains every choice—the pressure suit, the underwater telepathy, the coral-encrusted plaques all emerge from this specific environment. The mosaic's six-armed woman becomes functional when pressed, and the dome's structural weakness enables the final transformation. Setting literally rises at closure, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating truths that narrow the human's options: first the city's true nature, then the poison's actual target, finally the city's waiting purpose. Each revelation forces recalibration until the human must choose between mission and truth, with the helmet removal as irreversible commitment. Cost is visceral in the drowning/transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of certainty into nuance—the scholars' lies, the reframing of "monster" as child, poison becoming pigment. The final line "the surface... no longer a boundary, but a threshold" offers resonant answer without stating a moral. The six-armed mosaic woman "cradling different truths" elegantly embodies the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Liora's telepathic voice as "pressure, a ripple through water" creates distinct texture, and the italicized projections clearly separate from narration. Some filter-heavy passages ("The human's breath hitched") and occasional register elevation ("incisively kind") create minor friction, but the voice maintains coherence through the transformation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("coral-encrusted plaques as if reading the dead city's pulse"), but several filter-verb clusters and some elevated diction ("structural weakness of their certainty") that doesn't fully match the visceral underwater setting. The "tap-tap-tapping" metaphor works well. Minor repetition in "the human's" construction could vary more.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The reversal of drowned/planted city and the foxglove's transformation from poison to pigment show genuine ingenuity. The telepathic statue as guardian of truth rather than dead artifact feels fresh. The ending image of the surface as threshold rather than boundary resonates, though some philosophical framing feels slightly familiar.</comment>
