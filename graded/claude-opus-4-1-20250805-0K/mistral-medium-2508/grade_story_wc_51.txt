<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's transformation from collector to integrated vessel is earned through embodied struggle with the weights she carries. The contradiction between her role as unwilling receiver and necessary processor creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract handling of the child's fear lingering without more specific embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered weights until Elira's recognition "She was not the weaver. She was the loom" reweights everything with clear cost—her dissolution into the grotto. The orientation anchors (grotto, Elira, collecting weights) establish by ~100 words. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost: she becomes part of the grotto's eternal function.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bronze grotto functions as more than setting—its "shingled hush" and breathing presence constrain Elira's choices and ultimately absorbs her. Strong sensory work with "bronze plates groaning" and starlight "thin as needlework." The grotto's agency shapes the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: individual weights → grotto's ancient burden → Elira's absorption. The grotto's counterpressure ("wanted to give back") forces her final acceptance with clear cost. Agency manifests as renunciation—she accepts becoming the loom rather than fighting it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The weaver/loom reversal offers a non-literal answer to burden-bearing without moralizing. The final image of villagers hearing her song while she's absorbed into the grotto reweights all prior collecting as preparation for this eternal role. Strong thematic coherence through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("whalebone harp," "shingled hush") that serves the accumulative mode. Some register elevation in places like "boundary-lessly trapped" feels slightly forced. The perceptual signature of weight-as-texture remains consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations. Deduction for occasional overwriting ("boundary-lessly trapped," some modifier stacking) and slight template cadence in the middle catalog of weights. The closing section regains strength with controlled, resonant imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of burden-collection manifesting as physical integration with place offers a fresh angle. The grotto as living repository and Elira's transformation avoid expected resolution paths. Some familiar elements (mystical burden-bearer) are transformed through specific execution.</comment>
