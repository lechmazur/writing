<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's affectionate skepticism creates genuine internal contradiction (kissing cat but scoffing at horoscopes), and her choice to paint rather than immediately follow Mira shows agency with visible cost. The motivation to "illuminate" pathways drives concrete action through the sliver-pressing sequence. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("ego dissolution") and the slightly convenient arrival of the sliver without stronger causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through light-as-pathway revelation building to Charged Poise closure where Lena stands at the painted door. The "Let's go find her" decision with cat in arms lands with emotional cost—choosing connection over skepticism. The sliver's dissolution into skin and door's heartbeat pulse create visceral stakes. Minor deduction for slightly rushed pacing in the telepathy pill exposition section.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The studio transforms from workspace to "node in a lattice" with walls that breathe light, constraining Lena's choice between following or painting. Sensory detail excels: "ozone and burnt sugar," "muscovite geode sliver thin as a whisper." The painted door becomes literal setting that charges the final image. Strong POV filtering through artist's perception of light and color.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation: static shock → sliver arrival → pressing to temple → walls breathing → Mira's voice → choice to paint the door. The cost is legible when Lena chooses to paint rather than immediately follow, creating a door "half-painted into existence." Stakes tighten as the sliver dissolves irreversibly into her skin, foreclosing retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between skepticism and belief, crystallizing in "worth believing in—not because they were true, but because they *mattered*." The willowglass hope stroke as "delicate, unbreakable" resonates with Lena's transformed skepticism. The painted door as threshold between worlds offers a non-literal answer to whether connection transcends physical reality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through artist's lens: "colors have names now, and they're all wrong," "pigments that didn't exist yet." Voice modulates effectively from technical ("fiber-optic brushes") to lyrical ("texture, a brushstroke of longing"). Minor deduction for slight register elevation in "fractal, precise" at the end that doesn't fully match Lena's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The studio smelled of ozone and burnt sugar" establishes setting, aftermath, and tone. Rhythm varies naturally between short declaratives ("Lena smiled") and complex observations. Some figurative density in peak beats ("veins of light pulsing in rhythms") but serves the accumulative design. Minor filter-verb clustering around "she understood, then."></comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathy-as-art with the painter literally creating doorways between consciousness states. The "affectionate skeptic" who believes in gravity but not its intentions offers a non-obvious character stance. Risk-taking in the experimental light-as-texture approach and Mira's voice as brushstroke heightens stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
