<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is consistently rooted in her devotion to symbiosis over doctrine, with her final choice to continue working despite terminal illness carrying visible cost. The internal contradiction between acceptance of death and defiance through action operates throughout. Minor deduction for Tomas's conversion feeling slightly convenient, though his curiosity is seeded early.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure with Tomas taking up the wire, showing the work continues beyond individual life with visible cost ("years"). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the ending. Orientation anchors established early (temple orchard, Elira as caretaker, terminal diagnosis).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The temple orchard with stone pillars and symbiotic systems constrains choices throughout—the hollow chambers enable root-fungi exchange, the copper wire feeds minerals to trees. Setting actively shapes the central conflict between doctrine and symbiosis. The sapling-pillar relationship embodies the thematic question.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving symbiosis over purity) established early and deepens through Elira's work on the western sapling despite elder opposition. The cost is legible in her physical deterioration ("knees cracking like old timber") and ultimate death. One meaningful deepening occurs through Tomas's transformation from skeptic to convert.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete marriage of copper/oak, stone/root without explicit moralizing until Elira's diary line, which feels earned. The final image of Tomas weaving while pillars "sigh" offers a non-literal answer about continuity over individual permanence. Subtext operates well in the copper-wrapping as both practical and philosophical act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person with selective perception (Elira notices botanical details, oxidation patterns). Dialogue between Elira and Tomas carries subtext effectively ("teaching them to ask" vs "beg"). Minor deduction for slight register elevation in narrative voice during some descriptive passages that doesn't fully match Elira's practical perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("joints to brittle hinges," "pillars breathed"). Some figurative density in opening that doesn't fully pay off ("breathed" metaphor). Minor scaffold in repeated "copper wire" phrasings without variation. Information density good but occasional redundancy in describing the symbiotic system.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The copper-wire-as-symbiosis concept offers a fresh angle on mentorship/legacy themes, made specific through botanical detail. The transformation of architectural "corruption" into ecological wisdom feels earned. Risk-taking in the quiet ending works well, though the premise of defying religious orthodoxy through gardening is somewhat familiar.</comment>
