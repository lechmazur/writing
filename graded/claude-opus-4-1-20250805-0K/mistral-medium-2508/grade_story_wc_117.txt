I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered moments and sensory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mira finds her voice.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is grounded in specific, embodied details ("tuning fork in his pocket," "fingers always itching") and his therapeutic patience feels earned through backstory. The shift from professional competence to vulnerable participation during the eclipse shows genuine complexity. Minor deduction for Lila's relatively thin presence as catalyst rather than full character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully - Mira's recovered hum creates a before/after with visible emotional cost ("tears of someone who'd just remembered how to wonder"). The accumulative structure coheres through musical motifs building to the eclipse moment. Slight dock for the epilogue feeling rushed after the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sage Ridge functions as more than setting - it actively participates ("The ridge sang back"). The sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's musical perception ("air would taste like iron and possibility"). The curl's transformation under eclipse light constrains and enables the crucial choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: three sessions of silence, then the risk of the eclipse trip, culminating in the ridge's response. The dominant stake (Mira's lost voice) tightens through each attempt. Cost is visible in Lila's "half laugh, half sob" and the generational passing of the curl.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "ordinary magic" - the patience of therapeutic work versus the extraordinary eclipse moment. The final image of the stroke survivor's twitching fingers resonates backward, reweighting the entire piece. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit "ordinary magic" callback.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias's perceptual signature is distinct ("noticed two things immediately," musical metaphors throughout). Some lovely compression ("voice rough as dried sage"). Dialogue limited but functional. Deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't fully match the established voice ("celestial spectacle").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("roots drinking rain"). Information density high in opening paragraphs. However, some template phrasing appears ("For a heartbeat, nothing") and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy. The final section feels slightly rushed with tell-heavy summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of music therapy with mystical landscape offers fresh territory. The curl as conduit is specific and unexpected. However, the "healing through music" frame is familiar, and the resolution follows predictable beats despite strong execution.</comment>
