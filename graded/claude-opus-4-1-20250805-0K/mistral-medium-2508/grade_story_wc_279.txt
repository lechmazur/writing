<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lior's motivation to preserve rather than erase is clear and consistent, with embodied reactions like "pulse stuttered" and concrete choices to listen/draw rather than scrub. The transformation from passive observer to active creator lands with cost (accepting the void's hunger), though internal contradiction could be more simultaneous rather than sequential.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns densify from chalk mural to mandala to the final void-drawing, with each iteration deepening Lior's commitment. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through "Some things were meant to be devoured" - accepting dissolution as creation's cost. Who/where/when anchored early ("grotto," "Lior," "unlearning week").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grotto functions as active participant through whispers and acoustic properties that constrain choices ("pressed his ear to it"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (lavender/slate chalk, cool sands, mist texture), with the flake's physical transformation charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal artistic expression to communal memory preservation as the mandala opens the void and releases "the village's buried doubts." The flake's burning and directive to "interject now" creates genuine urgency, though the resolution's cost (accepting dissolution) could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central paradox "The mess is the map" - meaning found in chaos rather than clean erasure. The child adding to the mural and its wild growth overnight demonstrates theme through action. Final image of feeding the void reweights all prior creation as temporary but necessary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through artist's attention to texture/color ("cobalt and ochre in slow spirals") and social observation ("baker's hands shook when she lied"). Prose rhythm accelerates during the mandala sequence, though some filter phrases ("Lior realized") could be cut for immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong moments like "The mist coiled through the grotto like a held breath" and varied sentence structures maintain momentum. Some repetitive stems ("He didn't..." appears multiple times) and occasional overwriting ("emergent hush" feels forced) prevent higher scoring. Information density generally high with lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of communal unlearning/erasure with one artist preserving through creation offers fresh angle on memory and resistance. The grotto as sentient archive and the flake as dissolved guide avoid typical mentor tropes. Risk-taking in the abstract ending enhances thematic coherence.</comment>
