I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric with precision.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal dominant at closure) - The story accumulates fractured timeline imagery while maintaining causal linkage through Elias's confrontation with his other self, leading to integration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's weightlessness and relationship to gravity creates a consistent character-specific trait that drives the central conflict. The confrontation with his shadow-self demonstrates contradictory impulses acting in scene ("*'Not this time.'* He lunged."), though the emotional embodiment could be more visceral during the merger. Internal consistency holds throughout, with clear motivation to conquer the fractured selves.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong closure through Resonant Reconfiguration - Elias achieves integration by merging with his fractured self, with visible cost (tablet crumbles, runes burn into skin). The hybrid lens holds as accumulative imagery ("fractured into jagged shards") builds toward causal resolution. The orientation anchors (viaduct, Elias, rain) establish by ~50 words. Cost is legible in "The tablet flared white-hot in his hand, the runes searing into his skin."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The viaduct functions as more than setting - it's a "procedural generation of moments" that constrains choice and enables the final transformation. Sensory detail is selective ("wet stone slick with rain," "neon glow"), filtered through Elias's unique perception of gravity's hesitation. The environment directly shapes tactics as the stone "rewound... *sideways*" guides his path to confrontation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure (hundred/thousand attempts) to the decisive confrontation. The dominant stake - conquering the fractured self - tightens when Elias faces his shadow-version and chooses action over repetition. Cost manifests physically (runes searing) and metaphysically (tablet destroyed, timeline collapsed), with agency driving the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the labyrinth metaphor - not external but "in the spaces between breaths." The final image of walking into unrecognized territory after integration offers resonant answer to the central question of self-conquest. The parenthetical ending "(And somewhere, in a timeline that no longer existed...)" adds conceptual cost without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm ("Not backward, but *sideways*") and purposeful compression. POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature evident in how Elias experiences gravity and time differently. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("procedural generation") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon, though it serves the speculative concept.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("shattering glass in reverse"), but some figurative density in peak beats without full payoff ("darkening brightness," "wet paper" similes cluster). Information density is high and propulsive. Template cadence appears briefly ("He looked... He had... He walked") but doesn't pervade. The final sequence maintains momentum through varied syntax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The fractured timeline concept with physical merger of split selves offers fresh angle on self-integration narratives. The viaduct as procedural generation that rebuilds with each failure is inventive. Specific details like gravity's hesitation around Elias and runes shaped like broken hourglasses avoid generic treatment. Risk-taking in the hybrid structure and parenthetical meta-ending enhances coherence.</comment>
