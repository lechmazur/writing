I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece - fortunes accumulate meaning, patterns of open secrets build density, and the final image of the train pulling away reweights all prior material through cadence shift rather than causal resolution.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Chen's motivation crystallizes through concrete actions - copying specs onto fortune slips, orchestrating information flow through vague-yet-cutting fortunes. The final choice to leave after twenty years carries visible cost ("the lighthouse dark behind him"). Internal contradiction between not believing in fate while writing prophetic fortunes creates authentic complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Chen's departure - the lighthouse going dark for the first time in twenty years marks decisive change with clear cost. The accumulative lens holds as fortunes and secrets layer toward the final reweighting. Minor orientation wobble with "the island" introduced before establishing Chen's location weakens early grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse's Fresnel lens "bent light into a warning" constrains Chen's final choice - he must leave for it to go dark. Brass-lined study, inkwell from grandmother, and the beacon's turning create lived-in specificity. The north cove children avoid "though no one ever said why" builds atmospheric pressure through selective detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal fortune-writing to espionage ("They're coming for the film") forcing Chen's departure. The dominant stake - maintaining open secrets versus exposure - tightens when the fisherman's daughter arrives. Cost becomes visible in "the lighthouse dark behind him for the first time in twenty years."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of "open secrets - truths hiding in plain sight" emerges through the lighthouse warning system, fortune slips containing weapon specs, and Chen's orchestration method. The final image of secrets staying open while "the tide, as always, would bring what was already lost" offers resonant non-literal answer to whether truth can remain both hidden and accessible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature emerges through Chen's fortune-writer lens - "vague enough to fit any life, sharp enough to cut when timing aligned." Brief dialogue maintains naturalism ("They're coming for the film" / "What about you?"). Rhythm modulates effectively from contemplative fortune-writing to urgent departure, though some filter verbs ("Chen knew how this worked") slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "the ink still damp with something heavier than soy sauce" conveys both physical detail and emotional weight. Some template cadence in fortune iterations and mild repetition of "somewhere" in the penultimate section. Prose maintains momentum through varied syntax, though occasional abstraction ("transposing life into a new key") lacks concrete grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper as information broker through fortune cookies containing weapon specs. The concept of "open secrets" and fortunes that become prophetic only in hindsight offers non-obvious angle on espionage genre. Specific detail like "third stall in the morning market" and grandmother's curse-writing inkwell prevents generic execution.</comment>
