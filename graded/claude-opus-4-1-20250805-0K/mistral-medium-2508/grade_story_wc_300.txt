I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered confessions and images toward a resonant reconfiguration where the inspector transforms from investigator to carrier/planter of truth.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inspector's transformation from skeptical investigator to bearer of radiance is earned through accumulating confessions that shift her understanding. Her hesitation before accepting the pearl and the embodied cost ("light unfolded—not outward, but in") demonstrate genuine internal conflict resolved through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the inspector transforms from seeker to bearer, with visible cost ("the pearl was gone now, its light woven into the fabric of the world"). The accumulative lens holds as confessions layer toward the decisive moment of accepting the pearl, though the final spreading of light borders on convenient resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystal caves with pulsing bioluminescent veins create atmospheric pressure, and the shells' physical placement ("each one buried deeper") constrains the inspector's path. However, the setting could more directly shape tactical choices beyond following a trail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through deepening confessions ("I wanted to be seen" → "I built this place to keep the world out") that reweight the inspector's understanding. The cost is visible when she accepts the pearl's burden, though the subsequent world-transformation lacks concrete opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of dissolving barriers between isolation and connection emerges organically through the shells' confessions and crystallizes in "The walls were never real." The bunker-as-womb metaphor and the inspector's final act of planting seeds of truth create resonant, non-literal answers to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm ("Her lantern flickered as she pressed deeper") and effective use of italics for the confessions. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("birth the radiance back into the world") that slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon during peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery, but occasional overwriting ("electric air," "resonant hush," "hungry, still waiting") and some template phrasing ("She understood then," "She didn't answer. Instead, she began"). The metaphorical density in places like "womb, waiting for someone brave enough" approaches purple territory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bunker inspection with spiritual transformation through the specific mechanism of shell confessions. The concept of a weapon that's actually a method for connection offers genuine originality, though some imagery (light spreading across sky) trends toward familiar territory.</comment>
