<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lydia's synesthetic perception creates distinctive interiority ("taste of burnt caramel, the scent of a violin's first trembling note"), and Elias's suicidal despair is embodied through gesture and stance. The choice to pass the coin carries visible cost—Lydia accepts her role as "ghost in the wings" rather than star. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around memory/possibility that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elias steps "into the *next act*" with the coin, foreclosing suicide. Cost is legible through Lydia's fading and acceptance of her recurring ghostly role. The fractured timeline and synesthetic layering create coherent pressure toward this moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard's synesthetic qualities constrain perception and enable connection ("trees heavy with fruit that shimmered like bruised silver"). The maze literally shifts to create the encounter. Setting details like "petals that crunched underfoot like brittle applause" integrate with the theatrical theme throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation operates through accumulative pressure—the orchard's offering, Lydia's recognition of Elias's despair, the visions of possible futures that "tangled with the present." The dominant stake (Elias's life/death choice) tightens through synesthetic overwhelm that forces his decision. Cost appears in both Lydia's fading and Elias forgetting "this ever happened."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the theatrical metaphor of acts, encores, and performances—life as ongoing show despite tragedy. The coin's journey between strangers who need it resonates without stating a moral. "Some encores were quieter than others" reweights Lydia's ghostly intervention as meaningful performance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through synesthetic perception ("music tasted like hope") and theatrical diction. Clean free indirect style for Elias's interiority. The prose modulates with emotional intensity, particularly in the vision sequence. Minor moments of elevated diction ("fractured the night she died") fit the ghostly narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong sentence variety and rhythmic control, particularly in the vision sequence's accumulative syntax. Information density high—most lines advance multiple layers. Some minor repetition of "the orchard" and occasional abstract phrasing ("what came next") but these don't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story, synesthesia, and suicide intervention through theatrical metaphor. The tarot coin as recurring talisman between strangers and the orchard as sentient space that "carries the rest" offer non-obvious angles. Risk-taking in the lyric mode and fractured timeline enhances rather than obscures (+0.3).</comment>
