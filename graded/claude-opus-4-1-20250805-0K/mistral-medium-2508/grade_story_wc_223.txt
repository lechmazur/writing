<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's transformation from crisis actor to "historian of small gestures" is well-motivated, with her walking patterns as embodied ritual creating genuine character specificity. The final choice to give the penumbra "silence instead" of stories shows earned agency with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("benevolently ruthless") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught walking rituals building to Resonant Reconfiguration when Liora releases the wing-moments and the penumbra retreats. Cost is legible in her dissolution "into the dark" and the gallery's transformation. The chessboard's reassembly with unmoving pieces creates Charged Poise that reweights the entire premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery functions as active setting through its stored voices and physical deterioration, while Liora's ritualistic steps create micro-setting that constrains her actions. The chessboard's warmth "pulsing like a second heart" provides crucial sensory grounding. Some passages lean abstract ("nomadic penumbra") without sufficient physical anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from preservation to transformation as Liora discovers the pawns "unbound themselves," forcing her pivot from historian to liberator. The penumbra's approach creates genuine pressure, and her final walking pattern "release" shows agency with cost. One meaningful deepening that changes her understanding and tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the spaces between stories mattering more than the stories themselves, crystallized in "What will you carry when the weight is gone?" The chessboard's transformation into wings and final reassembly offers resonant non-literal answer about release versus preservation without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric compression ("cathedral of forgotten kings," "luminous absence"). POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature in how Liora reads gestures and absences. Slight register elevation in places ("interregnum," "nomadic penumbra") but consistent with her historian role.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("wings...fragile as moths, each bearing the weight of a stolen gesture"). Some abstract passages lack concrete grounding, and occasional synonym loops ("benevolently ruthless"/"benevolent, ruthless"). The pattern-taught walking-as-writing device adds propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crisis actor becoming historian of gestures facing an entity that consumes memory. The concept of pawns ascending rather than being captured transforms chess metaphor meaningfully. The spaces-between-stories resolution feels earned and non-obvious.</comment>
