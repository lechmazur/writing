<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lirien's motivation as a "chivalrous thief" who steals forgotten things and leaves brightness is clear and drives the heist. The Keeper's trembling hands when finding his name and his whispered "You could have taken anything" show genuine emotional embodiment. Internal complexity emerges through Lirien's unspoken answer about doors needing keys, though some moments lean toward abstraction ("apprentice of wonder").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the sky beginning to mend and the spire singing after the exchange. The causal chain from theft to swap to revelation to healing holds, with visible cost in the Keeper's emotional breakthrough and Lirien's risk. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the pattern of exchanges building toward transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The wrong sky with violet sun and moving stars establishes an altered world immediately. The spire's ice that shapes itself into footholds and the chess pieces carved from saints' and sinners' bones create tactile specificity. Setting constrains choice through the vertical climb and the Keeper's precisely arranged chambers, though some descriptions tend toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from physical theft to emotional exchange when the Keeper confronts Lirien mid-heist. The tension peaks with "You think time is a thing to be stolen?" forcing Lirien's philosophical stance. The cost manifests in both the Keeper's vulnerability and the sky's transformation, though the resolution feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the pattern of exchange—stealing what's forgotten to leave something brighter—culminating in the sky mending after human connection. The master's teaching about the unknown as door resonates through Lirien's actions without explicit statement. The ending image of walking toward "the next wonder" embodies theme through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "needle of black ice piercing the belly of the wrong sky." Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("I think it's a thing to be amended"). Some moments drift toward elevated register that strains POV credibility ("sacredly playful"), and the prose occasionally prioritizes poetry over clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery like "where the sun bled violet and the stars moved like schools of fish" creates atmosphere. However, abstract phrases accumulate ("apprentice of wonder," "embrace the unknown," "the next wonder") without sufficient grounding. Some figurative language feels forced ("laugh was the sound of cracking ice") and the ending repetition of "And the next" creates unnecessary padding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of a thief who replaces stolen items with something meaningful offers a fresh angle on heist stories. The wrong sky and the sundial lid containing trapped light create original worldbuilding. However, the resolution through emotional revelation and world-healing feels somewhat conventional for literary fantasy.</comment>
