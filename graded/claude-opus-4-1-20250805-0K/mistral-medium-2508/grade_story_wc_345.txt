<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and consistent, though Kael's ghostly existence lacks embodied specificity beyond flickering edges. The collective's transformation from strangers to family feels earned through concrete actions (repairing channels, stringing lanterns), with visible cost in the fractured land they heal. Internal conflict operates more through accumulation than simultaneous contradiction, limiting depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through "We stay" - transforming the nebula from escape to building-with, with cost visible in the war-scarred soil and collective effort required. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details (chalk messages, bell-ringing, butterfly garden) layer toward the final reweighting of "respite." Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words with Liora on Veyth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating arches and pulsing fruit create vivid otherworldly specificity, while the butterfly garden's shattered-moon wings ground the fantastical in concrete imagery. The watering bell constrains choice (must be rung for arches to listen) and charges the final image when it becomes "warm to the touch." Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake - transforming Veyth into the nebula of respite - signals early and deepens through collective effort rather than reversals. Escalation occurs through accumulation (more arrivals, more repairs) with cost visible in the war-damaged land, though agency feels distributed rather than driven by Liora's decisions. The final "We stay" crystallizes stance with earned weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the shift from individual respite-seeking to collective building-with, never stated directly. The chalk message "Reexamine the cracks. That's where the light gets in" operates as both literal instruction and thematic key. The final reframing of the nebula from destination to process resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "fruit pulsed with starlight" and "ribs of a god the planet had swallowed whole," though Kael's dialogue ("You're early") carries effective understatement. POV remains stable with Liora throughout, and psychic distance modulates appropriately from cosmic observation to intimate soil-touching. Some figurative density in opening risks overwriting but serves the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks, with lines often doing double work (description + atmosphere). Information density is high without feeling rushed. Minor template cadence appears in "She [verb]" patterns mid-story, and some figurative language borders on purple ("split the sky"), but clarity remains intact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The altruistic ghost who helps rather than haunts offers fresh inflection on spectral fiction, while the nebula-as-state-not-place reframes the quest narrative. The collective healing of war-torn land through patient tending avoids tidy resolution. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode and non-confrontational closure heightens meaning without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
