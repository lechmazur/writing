<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's internal conflict between needing answers and letting go creates genuine tension through embodied details like "breath fogged the glass" and the notebook against her ribs. The final renunciation of "the need to know where the falling ended" carries visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for the sister reference feeling slightly underintegrated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration through Liora's decision to let go, carrying clear emotional cost. The snow globe's physics defying gravity and the lighthouse beam pulsing create pattern breaks that reweight meaning. The orientation anchors arrive cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drowned library with "books bloated into pulpy sculptures" and the snow globe's counterclockwise snow constrain Liora's understanding and choices. Sensory details like "cloying pressure of the dive suit" and bioluminescent fish "like fallen stars" create vivid atmosphere that serves the story's physics-of-letting-go theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding what Amelia discovered about thresholds—escalates through the snow falling upward, then sideways, forcing Liora's stance crystallization. Her choice to file a false report ("No significant findings") carries professional cost. The pressure coheres well under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The threshold metaphor ("The horizon isn't a line. It's a threshold") elegantly unifies Amelia's disappearance with Liora's grief about her sister. The final image of letting go "not of the grief...but of the need to know where the falling ended" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature in phrases like "untangling threads until the knot surrendered its shape" and "silhouette dissolving like sugar in tea." Voice maintains sophisticated control through pressure, though occasional elevated diction ("cloying," "fold") slightly strains the dive-scene context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("brass reading lamps still cradled ghosts of light"). Minor template cadence in "She noted...She had spent...She had come" sequence. Information density high, particularly in the snow globe descriptions doing multiple jobs simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis linking Earhart's disappearance to quantum physics concepts creates non-obvious angle. The snow globe as portal/threshold device and the specific detail of "holes that weren't from rust or depth, but from something passing through" elevate beyond typical shipwreck narrative.</comment>
