I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Identified: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through pattern accumulation (window displays, magnetic resonance) toward a resonant reconfiguration where the library's survival emerges from collective, synchronized resistance.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation coheres well through concrete actions (pawn in pocket, iron filings dancing) and his chess-coach patience translates effectively to orchestrating resistance. The contradiction between teaching foresight and facing immediate threat creates genuine tension. Deduction for some abstract interiority ("forests of second thoughts") that lacks full embodiment in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - the library remains through collective action with visible cost (workers' aching teeth, town's "unspoken rhythm"). The accumulative lens holds as synchronized displays build to magnetic resistance. Minor deduction for slightly opaque causality around how the grotto's magnetism literally seals doors, though the pattern teaches itself adequately.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto functions brilliantly as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the finale. "Cobalt library stood like a bruise" establishes strong atmosphere immediately. The grotto's evolving properties (humming walls → glowing veins → singing filings) directly enable the climactic resistance, making environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate effectively from whispered threat through window displays to physical confrontation. The dominant stake (library's survival) tightens through coordinated resistance with clear cost. Slight deduction because the council's capitulation feels abrupt - we don't see their decision process, only the posted notice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the chess metaphor ("see three moves ahead," "pieces on an unseen board") without explicit moralizing. The final insight about "quiet things that refuse to be forgotten" resonates deeply with the accumulative structure. The recurring pawn grounds abstract resistance in concrete object.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature through chess-filtered observations and selective attention to magnetic phenomena. "The unspoken words—whispering between the shelves like ink dissolving in water" demonstrates distinct voice. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("the hush where past meets prophecy") that strains POV consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("library stood like a bruise in the mist"). However, some figurative density in non-peak moments ("forests of second thoughts," "ideas waiting to be remembered") and template repetition in the window display sequence. The "sang" moment of magnetic resistance is precise and effective.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto as source of resistance offers fresh angle on library-salvation narrative. Synchronized window displays as chess positions creates original protest imagery. The quiet rebellion through attraction rather than noise provides genuine novelty, though the wise-mentor-mobilizes-students frame is somewhat familiar.</comment>
