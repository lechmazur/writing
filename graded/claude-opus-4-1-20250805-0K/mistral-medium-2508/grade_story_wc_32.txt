<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation through "unproductive obsession" and the hunger to prove himself drives consistent choices, with contradictory impulses (feeding the crozier memories vs. doubt) acting simultaneously in scene. The final transformation earns its cost through prior causality—his scars literally unmade. Minor deduction for the guildmaster's dialogue feeling slightly diagnostic ("Some men are born to tend fires, not light them").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the crystallized ending where Elias achieves vivification through "interrupting death at the root." The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (the guild flees, world remakes). Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract conceptualization of vivification mid-story.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ember nexus functions as constraining micro-setting—its "veins of molten copper" and heartstone directly enable the transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (breath frosting from the crozier's cold, the "sickly gold" glow). The frozen bloom's crystal petals charging the final image elevate the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the crozier's increasing hunger—from memories to doubt to the forbidden incantation "Let it be worse." The cost is legible when his scars reverse and the world remakes. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length. Minor deduction as the guild's reaction feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of "creative destruction" into creation-through-unmaking. The ending offers a non-literal answer—Elias will "tend the fire and light it"—that reweights the guild's earlier dismissal. The frozen bloom as "the precise shade of a held breath finally released" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through alchemical observation ("blackened lace, beautiful and inert"). Voice maintains consistency through pressure, though some phrases edge toward purple ("bitten by something stronger than faith"). Dialogue is minimal but functional. The POV holds without slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the nexus's embers dimmed—not like a flame guttering, but like a lung pausing mid-breath"). However, figurative density in peak beats without full payoff (-0.5), some elevated diction clashing with urgency ("successive approximation toward something alive"), and occasional overwrought metaphors ("light filtered through bruised skin") accumulate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of vivification as "interrupting death at the root" rather than breathing life into dead matter offers a fresh angle. The reversal of scars and unmaking of damage provides specific transformation. However, the alchemist-versus-guild frame and some metaphorical choices feel familiar without full transformation.</comment>
