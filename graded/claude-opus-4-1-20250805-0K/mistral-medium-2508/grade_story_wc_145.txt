<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's transformation from observer-editor to herald is earned through concrete discovery—the condensation patterns, Kael's journal, the phrasebook page—with embodied tension ("hands that didn't tremble" belying inner recognition). The final acceptance carries visible cost: dissolving into the lake's consciousness, surrendering her cartographic certainty for mythic becoming.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern recognition builds through condensation, phrasebook fragments, and Kael's notes until Lena's palm on ice triggers the Resonant Reconfiguration—she becomes what she sought to map. Cost is legible: her human form dissolves into the lake's primordial memory, the outpost groans "in relief" at witnessing completion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen lake functions as active constraint—its "black and glassy" center draws investigation while its ice "sighs" and parts with "invitation," making environment inseparable from revelation. Precise occupational detail (pH readings, topographic surveys) grounds the mythic turn, and the condensation patterns literally become language, constraining how discovery unfolds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation tracks through accumulating evidence—falcon's delivery, Kael's disappearance, the translated warning—until Lena's deliberate breath-pattern on glass becomes active participation rather than observation. The lake's response ("not from force but from invitation") confirms her agency shapes the outcome, with clear cost in her dissolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The central question—where do origins begin?—reweights from geographical to existential as Lena discovers rivers flow backward to their source, and she herself is that source. The phrasebook's "beginning" and "end" in a dead tongue gain resonance when she dissolves the page into the lake, literally rewriting currents.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lena notices through cartographic precision ("north-by-northwest," "delta, a fork") that transforms into mythic recognition. The voice modulates from dry observation to participatory awe while maintaining coherence, and the lake's "voice" speaking in the dead tongue feels earned through prior textual preparation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful compression ("She wasn't supposed to be here" creates immediate tension). Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("quiet catastrophe," "worrying tranquility") and one instance of elevated diction drift ("unfolded, a slow bloom of liquid darkness") that slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The reversal of rivers as convergence point rather than source offers genuine freshness, especially when tied to Lena's professional identity as someone who maps beginnings. The synthesis of hydrological science with mythic transformation feels specific and earned, avoiding generic mysticism through concrete details like pH readings and condensation physics.</comment>
