I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict between storytelling and song-singing creates genuine tension, with embodied details like trembling fingers and the burning throat. The transformation from avoidance to acceptance earns its emotional weight through specific sensory work, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("stories were safer than songs, which demanded truth").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Mira shifts from tinkerer to "keeper of songs," with visible cost in her physical struggle and what she "almost let die." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the arbor's revival, though the resolution's completeness ("the world felt whole") slightly undercuts the established stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The arbor functions as both setting and character, with vines that "sagged" then "unfurled with a sound like stretching silk." Sensory work is selective and purposeful (liquid gold light, scent of ripe earth), and the environment actively constrains choice through the dying vines and withering gourds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal reluctance through physical struggle ("throat burned, chest tight") to communal restoration. The cost is embodied in Mira's physical strain and years of avoidance, though the arbor's too-complete recovery deflates some earned tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between mechanical creation and organic tradition, with the automaton serving as counterpoint to the living arbor. The final image of Mira humming while vines sway captures the story's argument about preservation through practice, though "some things are too precious to lose" veers toward explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with selective perception ("liquid gold," "vine tendrils around a trellis") that fits Mira's tinkerer-artist sensibility. Some register elevation in peak moments ("the lock was time itself") doesn't quite match the established lexicon, and dialogue tends toward the declarative.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("leaves rustling like a gathering hush") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract declarations ("The melody was a key, and the lock was time itself"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("songs her people had let slip into silence" echoes the earlier "no one remembered the songs anymore").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of clockwork and organic imagery offers a fresh angle on the restoration narrative, with specific details like "brass gears" against "sacred gourds." However, the resolution's tidiness and the explicit thematic statement reduce risk-taking that might have elevated the piece.</comment>
