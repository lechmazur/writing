I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** with elements of temporal fragmentation that converge at closure.

<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene ("Almost lied. Almost said *yes*") with the final act of soaring earned through accumulated temporal paradoxes. Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("feral nostalgia clawed at his ribs"). Minor deduction for occasional abstraction in emotional states that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly with "Soared" as conceptual repricing after burning the scrolls frees him from chronicler role. Temporal fragmentation pattern taught early and sustained. Cost is visible in the empty grave and acceptance of multiplicity. Slight opacity in the exact mechanics of time-looping doesn't obscure the closure's emotional truth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mountain cabin setting constrains choices through its recursive nature ("too many versions of the same man hunched over the same desk"). Sensory details selective and POV-filtered ("birch bark scroll unraveled like a sigh"). The grave and wind function as environmental pressure. Doesn't quite reach 8+ as setting could more actively shape the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escaping the chronicler role) established early and deepens through encounter with younger self. The burning of scrolls represents meaningful agency that forecloses the path of documentation with visible cost ("He'd *be* that scream, someday"). Pressure coheres under accumulative lens as repeated cycles intensify toward liberation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accumulation of temporal paradoxes and the final image of soaring reweights all prior material about being trapped in documentation. The empty grave and burned scrolls offer non-literal answer to whether one can escape their own story. Subtext operates brilliantly in the dialogue between selves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout with parenthetical asides creating temporal uncertainty ("Or never here. Or both."). Prose modulates effectively between lyric compression and scene work. Controlled experimental techniques (fragments, parentheticals) serve the temporal confusion without sacrificing clarity at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The cabin held its breath"). Some figurative density in opening third but serves accumulative pattern. Clean propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful fragments. Minor repetition of "Elias" could be trimmed but doesn't harm momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-loop and meta-chronicler concepts with specific execution through birch bark runes and multiple selves. The solution (burning the scrolls to escape documentation) feels inevitable yet surprising. Risk-taking in temporal structure and experimental punctuation heightens stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
