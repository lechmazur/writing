<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in paternal regret, with embodied details like the compass "digging into his ribs." The internal conflict between leaving and staying plays out through concrete micro-choices. However, the daughter remains an abstraction through letters only, and some emotional beats lean toward therapy-speak ("the slow work of coming home").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's shift from leaving to staying, with visible cost in the three years of unread letters. The accumulative lens holds as utility poles accumulate meaning. Orientation is clear by ~100 words. The closure lands but the cost could be more visceral—we see regret but not its full price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The coastal setting and utility poles effectively constrain choice and become Elias's new navigation system. Sensory details like "saltwind" and "briny tang of kelp" ground the atmosphere. However, the setting doesn't fully pressure the central choice—the launch could be any departure point.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reconciliation vs. escape) is clear early and tightens when Elias reads the first letter. Agency manifests through his decision to stay. However, escalation relies heavily on internal reflection rather than present-scene pressure, and the conflict lacks a meaningful middle tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the navigation metaphor—from stars to utility poles representing the shift from grand aspirations to mundane presence. The ending offers resonant non-literal answer about "staying still" versus constant motion. Some passages edge toward explicit moralizing but recover through concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with maritime vocabulary and melancholic tone. The perceptual signature of counting poles is distinctive. However, dialogue is minimal (one exchange), and some passages drift into elevated register incongruent with Elias's working-class navigator identity ("gravitate toward the weight of what he hadn't done").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("He'd...", "He...") and occasional overwriting ("merrily melancholic," "the kind of blue that swallowed apologies whole"). Several paraphrase loops appear, like the redundant emphasis on choosing charts over daughter. Information density is uneven, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others merely restate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The utility poles as navigation system offers a fresh angle on the lost parent trope. The specific detail of counting poles between locations feels authentic. However, the reconciliation arc follows familiar patterns without significant transformation, and some metaphors feel forced rather than organic.</comment>
