<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lior's silence as active choice rather than inability creates genuine character depth, with contradictory impulses visible when he opens his mouth but produces no sound, then shapes air into melody. The final renunciation of speech for building doors shows earned transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and symbolic fragments build toward Lior's transformation from listening to building. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when silence shifts from retreat to offering to door-building, with emotional cost visible in his smile before beginning anew.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train constrains choices through its warped materials and impossible geography ("corridors twisted," "wrong turn"), while the oasis car's expanded mirrors directly shape Lior's final understanding. Desert setting's "misting hush" that "didn't belong" creates atmospheric pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through textural deepening: finding fragment leads to following song, entering impossible car, witnessing alternate selves, then receiving/returning the halo with new understanding. The cost manifests when Lior's silence transforms from withdrawal to creative offering.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the halo fragment, broken music box, and wind chimes—building toward the insight that "some doors weren't meant to be opened. They were meant to be built." The final image of Lior beginning to build reweights all prior silence and restoration work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Lior's craftsman's attention to materials ("warped wood," "gold leaf like captured sunlight") and his synesthetic experience of silence. Free indirect style cleanly captures his non-verbal consciousness, particularly in "the silence wasn't his retreat—it was his offering."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves lyrical density with lines like "melody of sawdust and rust" but suffers from occasional overwriting ("ghostly under the moon," "thrown confetti") and some filter-verb clustering ("Lior stood," "He stepped," "She stopped"). Template cadence appears in "The mirrors rippled. The train groaned" sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of a carpenter who sings through shaping air rather than voice offers genuine freshness, though the magical realism elements (impossible car, transforming mirrors) follow familiar patterns. The specific synthesis of circus decay and creative silence creates memorable texture.</comment>
