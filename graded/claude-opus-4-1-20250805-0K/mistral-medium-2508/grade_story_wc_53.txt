I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring an Accumulative/Textural drive lens based on the layered temporal fragments and density patterns that build toward the final submersion.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's contradictory impulses between holding on and letting go manifest viscerally through her interaction with the camera wheel and ghosts. The final choice to jump and not struggle creates genuine cost. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("regret," "failure") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres through recurring images (camera wheel, lagoon, carousel) that reweight at closure when Lira lets herself be pulled under. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as she accepts being "remembered" by the lagoon. Slight opacity around the exact nature of the ghosts/iterations weakens causality but doesn't break closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon as "suspension of memory and mist" constrains choices throughout and charges the final image when it "remembers" rather than ripples. The carousel's frozen horses and the camera wheel's trapped ghosts create a lived-in fantastical space. Strong selective detail filtered through Lira's scavenger perspective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through the confrontation with ghost-iterations demanding acknowledgment, tightening when they emerge from the lagoon as a "chorus of regret." The jump creates agency through acceptance rather than resistance. Cost is visible but the stakes could sharpen earlier—the dominant stake of confronting abandoned selves emerges clearly only at midpoint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the accumulated weight of abandoned possibilities and the cost of moving forward. The final image of being pulled under "just until the carousel started again" offers a non-literal answer about cyclical return and the impossibility of escaping one's past selves. No explicit moralizing; complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled compression ("time had frayed like the hem of her coat") and selective perception that tracks Lira's scavenger mindset. The ghost dialogue maintains naturalistic indirection. Minor register drift in some abstract passages ("architect of clouds") but rhythm modulates effectively with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong imagistic precision and information density in most lines. Deductions for paraphrase loops around the ghost iterations ("each holding a different failure" followed by listing failures) and some abstract labeling. The prose maintains momentum but occasional scaffolding ("She didn't turn") and filter constructions weaken immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of confronting one's ghost iterations through a memory-lagoon and broken carousel offers fresh synthesis. The camera wheel as portal to alternate selves transforms the familiar device. Risk-taking in the non-linear temporal structure and fantastical elements heightens stakes while maintaining coherence (+0.3 within band).</comment>
