I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece. The story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causality, with the "whispering hush" serving as a recurring textural element that guides movement toward transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation as a "philanthropist with empty pockets" who trades light for fire is embodied through concrete actions—distributing vials, throwing them into lava, accepting transformation. The character arc from giving light to embracing fire transformation is earned, though some transitions ("of course she would fulfill it by accident") feel slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands effectively with Elira's transformation on the pumice raft, showing clear cost (empty hands, lost collection) and reconfigured understanding. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building texture through repeated imagery. Minor causality wobbles around the prophecy's convenient appearance dock 0.4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint—the receding tide forces action, the volcano's breath frames atmosphere, the black sand turning gold marks transformation. The micro-settings (cave walls, mirror shard, pumice raft) directly shape choices and charge the final image of the humming island.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through textural accumulation: from distributing hope to fulfilling prophecy to physical transformation. The tide's retreat creates genuine urgency, and throwing the vials into lava shows clear cost. The "trade light for fire" fulfillment feels slightly predetermined rather than fully earned through pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the texture of transformation—lava becoming stone, bugs becoming comets, Elira becoming "both less and more." The final image of erased footprints while the island hums ahead offers resonant, non-literal answer to transformation's nature without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "The volcano exhaled, its breath a slow curl of embers." POV remains stable with consistent perceptual signature—Elira notices through metaphor and sensation. Rhythm modulates effectively with pressure, particularly in the acceleration toward the lava scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("her wealth measured in borrowed time and the quiet gasps of strangers"). Some figurative density in places ("the celestial bodies dragged their heels") but it serves the accumulative mode. Minor template moments ("Elira laughed, sharp and bright") prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of bottled hope given away by someone with "empty pockets" offers fresh angle on philanthropy. The prophecy-by-accident mechanism and transformation through volcanic glass-making create original synthesis, though some elements (oracle cave, prophecies) lean familiar.</comment>
