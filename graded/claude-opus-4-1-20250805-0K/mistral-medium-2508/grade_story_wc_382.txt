<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with Elias's physical responses to the building's language ("staggered," "fingers trembled"). The cyclical transformation from student to teacher shows earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for Veyra's somewhat stock mysterious-mentor characterization, though the "died once already" smile adds specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through repeated lessons building to revelation. Strong closure as Elias becomes the new tutor (Decisive Change) with visible cost—he's now bound to the building's grief. The cyclical structure reinforces the trap. Minor orientation wobble with Veyra's sudden disappearance, but the pattern justifies it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The building itself functions brilliantly as setting—breathing, whispering, holding grief in its walls. Rooftop lessons during meteor showers create atmospheric pressure. The seal's warmth "like a held breath" and walls that "exhaled" make the environment actively constrain choices, particularly when Elias must confront what the building "did to her."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity about whispers to signing a blood contract to inheriting Veyra's role. The building's grief has "sharp edges now" shows clear cost. One meaningful deepening as Elias learns the language isn't for learning but "interrogating," forcing his question about the woman in the wallpaper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of "agreed upon lies"—that some agreements are tombs. The final image of Elias becoming what trapped him offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The woman's silhouette in the wallpaper and the building's grief create layered meaning about what we inherit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled lyricism ("wisteria vines curled like question marks," "meteor split the sky into jagged syllables"). POV remains stable with Elias. Dialogue carries subtext effectively—Veyra's statements that should be questions, the new tenant's echo. Minor convergence in the final scene's repetition, though it serves the cyclical structure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction in metaphors ("sky wrote in fire," "mercury between his ribs") but it coheres with the mystical tone. Minor template cadence in the lesson descriptions ("Veyra would," "Elias learned") but variation in the crucial beats maintains momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of haunted house and language-learning conceits through the literal interrogation of buildings. The cyclical trap structure and blood contract for architectural knowledge feel earned. Risk-taking in the ambiguous supernatural elements and the protagonist becoming complicit heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
