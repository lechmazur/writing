<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict between duty and truth conviction drives the entire arc with embodied tension ("pulse scandalized the stillness"). The decisive choice to release classified information demonstrates clear motivation rooted in years of "bravely conflicted" record-keeping, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("the cathedral of secrets"). Final martyrdom lands with earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: letter triggers investigation → discovery of conspiracy → decisive action → martyrdom with lasting systemic change. Closure achieves Decisive Change with visible cost (Elara's death) and Resonant Reconfiguration (archives now "speak back"). The revolution's echo beyond her death satisfies closure requirements, though the conspiracy revelation feels slightly rushed in the middle third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The frozen library setting actively constrains choices through isolation chambers, pneumatic tubes, and surveillance architecture. Sensory details like "frost-laced spine" and "ink that smelled of burnt copper" create atmosphere while the Vaults' physical layout shapes Elara's tactical options. Setting could more directly pressure the climactic confrontation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal discovery to systemic exposure to martyrdom. The "blink that follows surprise" timeframe creates genuine urgency, and Elara's choice between compliance and truth has irreversible consequences. Cost is unmistakable in her death and the permanent system breach, though middle-section pressure could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus institutional control emerges through concrete action rather than statement. The final image of archives "speaking back" resonantly answers the central question about preserved versus erased history. Some thematic articulation ("I've just *remembered*") edges toward explicit, but the martyrdom-as-voice transformation earns its weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent formality befitting an archivist with evocative diction ("scandalized the stillness," "treacherously alive"). Perceptual signature shows in how Elara notices frost, silence, and systemic patterns. Brief dialogue carries subtext effectively, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("cathedral of secrets") slightly beyond POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and information density, particularly in opening passages. Some figurative language clusters densely ("breath held before a scream," "cathedral of secrets," "hooked her like a barb") without full payoff. Minor template cadence appears in final rapid-fire declarations ("The snow kept falling. The library kept breathing.") but overall momentum sustains.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a cryogenic archive that erases rather than preserves history offers fresh angle on institutional memory. Elara's position as complicit keeper who becomes whistleblower-martyr transforms the archetype. The "archives speak back" reversal and posthumous system awakening provide non-obvious resolution to the truth/silence conflict.</comment>
