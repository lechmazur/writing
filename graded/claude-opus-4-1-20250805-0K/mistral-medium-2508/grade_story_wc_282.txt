<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lior's motivation crystallizes through embodied sensation (heat-mapping emotions, palm-to-fossil contact generating crimson memory-burns) and drives toward becoming "the voice of the unknown" with clear cost—defying stasis councils. The internal contradiction between preservation and rebellion acts simultaneously in scene. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("too exhausted to speak for itself") that briefly weakens embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and fossil interactions build toward Resonant Reconfiguration where Lior becomes the caves' cartographer. Closure lands with visible cost (fossil lifting, cave answering in vibration) and the final image of rain as promise reweights the journey. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (caves, Lior, post-hibernation setting).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cave environment actively constrains and enables choices—bioluminescent lichen brightens "as if sensing intent," fossils embedded in living matter recognize Lior through heat. Setting functions as co-agent, particularly when "the cave answered" in vibration. The fossil's impossible floating/levitating property charges the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from mapping echoes to active rebellion against stasis councils, with the cave's recognition forcing Lior's transformation into "voice of the unknown." Cost is legible when the fossil "seared their skin—not pain, but recognition" and the display dissolves into "a topographic map of grief." One meaningful deepening through cave-human communion satisfies scope requirements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the fossil as "transitional object" bridging dead and living worlds, with Lior's rebellion against stasis embodying renewal. The final rain hitting sand "with the weight of a promise" offers resonant non-literal answer to whether the post-hibernation world can reconnect. Minor deduction for "The unknown had a voice now" edging toward explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through sensory mapping ("fear spiked violet," "curiosity bloomed gold") and specialized vocabulary ("factually mystical," "transitional object"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("resonated" vs "echoed") slightly strains POV lexicon. Psychic distance modulates effectively from close observation to cosmic connection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("caves exhaled salt and damp," "fossil lifted from their palm, suspended in charged air"). Template cadence appears in mid-section ("Lior understood. The caves weren't just transitional. They were waiting.") creating minor drumbeat. Some abstract phrasing ("voice to the silences") reduces density but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate fiction with sensory cartography creates non-obvious angle—mapping emotions onto cave networks as rebellion against species-wide hibernation. The "factually mystical" approach to impossible phenomena and heat-mapping as communication method show genuine innovation. Risk-taking in making caves sentient participants heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
