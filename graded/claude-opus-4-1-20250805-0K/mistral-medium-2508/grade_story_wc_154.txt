<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's translator identity drives concrete choices—decrypting the child's crayon marks and reframing grief through negative space reading. Her embodied pain (ribs singing, shrapnel memory) creates authentic internal contradiction against her healer role. The boy encounter earns its resolution through her specific method of reading absence, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("unknotting fear like a cipher").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as fragments build toward the coral transfer—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lena's role shifts from translator to active grafter of meaning. Cost is visible in "ribs singing" and the weight of carrying others' grief. Opening orientation delayed but pays off thematically; the coral's journey from wreckage to gift reweights prior trauma imagery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The atrium's mist and twilight actively constrain perception while ivy "curled like old barbed wire" bridges war memory and present space. Brain coral's "labyrinthine grooves" function as both tactile anchor and metaphor for translation work. Setting details filter through Lena's translator lens—the glass ceiling as bruise, mist as memory of operating tents.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from passive receipt of the cast to active decryption to the boy's arrival demanding immediate application. The coral's pressure "bit deeper" physicalizes internal conflict. Final transfer carries cost—Lena walking "toward the mist, where the shapes of other broken things waited" shows endless demand, though the middle section could tighten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts of translation—from language to pain to grief's "dialect." The coral as "how the sea remembers the shore" transforms from debris to connection method without stating its meaning. Final image of smudges glowing "like embers cupped in careful hands" reweights the child's scrawls as preserved warmth rather than chaos.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains literary control with distinctive syntax ("shrewdly innocent that way") and selective perception filtering war and medical experience. Dialogue carries subtext—"I unknot them" reveals method while maintaining distance. Some register elevation in peaks ("labyrinthine grooves mirroring the atrium's archways") slightly exceeds the intimate POV established elsewhere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs—"mist coiled around her ankles, cool as the memory of the operating tent." Some metaphor clustering in opening paragraphs ("bruise of violet and gold," "labyrinthine grooves") creates mild overwriting. Strong information density and propulsion in dialogue exchanges; the final image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of war translator becoming grief translator through physical objects (coral, cast). The specific method—reading negative space in the brother's marker strokes—offers non-obvious insight. Risk-taking in fragmentary structure and delayed orientation serves the accumulative design, though some metaphors lean familiar.</comment>
