<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora's skepticism-to-belief arc is earned through concrete embodied moments (tile warming against wrist, hands tracing symbols) with visible cost in accepting her brother's loss. Internal contradiction plays out effectively as she simultaneously scoffs at magic while desperately needing its promise. The final renunciation of skepticism carries weight, though some interiority edges toward therapy-speak ("grief couldn't reach").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens drives the piece through density increase and pattern accumulation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora transforms from skeptic to "cartographer of echoes." Cost is legible in her acceptance that "grief, like the sea, was never just one wave." The closure lands with felt emotional price, though the extended coda after "She closed her eyes and listened" dilutes impact slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tower as open-to-elements setting constrains choices (exposed to wind, whale songs vibrating through bones) and charges the final image of invitation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt wind, brass eyepiece, obsidian weight). The tide pools below with "hundred more tiles" extends the world meaningfully, though some descriptions lean abstract ("pocket of stillness").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal skepticism through memory recovery to acceptance of ongoing grief with clear cost. The tile's warming and the vision of her brother represent meaningful deepening that changes Liora's knowledge and options. However, the resolution relies heavily on internal shift without external pressure after the vision, and the extended philosophical ending reduces tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of transcription becoming a method for processing grief—"the magic wasn't in the tile, but in the transcribing." The whale migration, recurring tiles, and transformation from stargazer to "cartographer of echoes" create resonant layers without stating morals. The ending offers a non-literal answer about grief's ongoing nature, though the extended coda risks over-articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("space *stretched*—not outward, but *inward*"). Perceptual signature clear in how Liora notices astronomical/navigational details. Some register drift occurs in philosophical passages ("cartographer of echoes," "frequency only the brave or broken could hear") that doesn't fully match the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments of clarity and propulsion ("She didn't believe the tile could *summon* him, but if it could sculpt space for his echo, she'd carve the whole sky"). However, the extended coda contains paraphrase loops ("The story, after all, was never hers alone. / It was the sea's. / The stars'.") and template cadence in short declarative lines that reduce momentum. Some abstract phrasing ("pocket of stillness," "entangled memories") lacks concrete grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-processing through astronomical observation and magical realism, with the specific detail of transcription as method. The transformation from skeptic to "cartographer of echoes" offers a non-obvious angle. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure and extended ending, though the philosophical coda edges toward safety in its comprehensive thematic coverage.</comment>
