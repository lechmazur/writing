<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The priest's choice to illuminate rather than exorcise creates genuine internal conflict with visible cost (his dissolution into indigo). However, the possession entity remains underdeveloped as pressure, and emotional embodiment relies on abstract concepts ("unraveled stillness") rather than concrete sensation in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the priest's transformation reweights the anchor from prison to question, with visible cost (his dissolution). The cyclical structure with the novice works well. Deduction for orientation delay - we don't understand the dimensional anchor's function until late, creating unnecessary opacity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor and indigo paint constrain choices effectively - the priest must physically enter the paint to complete his illumination. The chamber's "muffled clarity" and geometric cracks create atmospheric pressure. Strong integration of setting-as-character through the anchor's evolving nature.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Central stake (illumination vs preservation) is clear with meaningful escalation as the priest steps into the rising indigo. However, the possession entity offers minimal resistance after initial recognition, reducing dramatic pressure. The cost lands clearly but the opposition could be stronger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Excellent thematic emergence through the contrast between banishment and understanding, with the anchor's transformation from prison to question serving as the central metaphor. The cyclical structure with the novice reinforces theme without stating it. The "decoration" motif effectively reweights from surrender to intentional transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and effective use of italicized dialogue as thought-action. The perceptual signature around color and geometry is consistent. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't fully match the mystical-practical hybrid voice ("telegraphed its own obsolescence").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("frost on glass," "color of understanding"). However, repetitive sentence structures in the ending sequence ("The novice..." x3, "The..." x8 in final lines) create template cadence. Some abstract phrases lack concrete grounding ("unraveled stillness").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The loop pedal priest concept freshly combines technology with mysticism, and the dimensional anchor as both prison and question offers genuine originality. The transformation of exorcism into illumination subverts genre expectations meaningfully. Risk-taking in the abstract conceptual approach mostly succeeds.</comment>
