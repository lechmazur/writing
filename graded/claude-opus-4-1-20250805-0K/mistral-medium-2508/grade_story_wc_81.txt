I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to trace "honest origins" and uncover historical erasures drives credible choices throughout, with his methodical nature embodied in careful hands and steady pulse. The discovery of his own name creates genuine contradiction between his pursuit of truth and confronting personal stakes. However, the resolution—choosing to keep working while hiding the discovery—lacks the visible emotional cost needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain from stamp discovery through coordinate decoding to finding the hidden chamber with Elias's name. The Earned Stasis closure (returning to work while keeping the secret) lands with implicit cost—"Some stillness wasn't meant to be shared"—though the emotional price could be more visceral. The piece teaches its accumulative pattern early through layered discoveries and pays it off when the final revelation recontextualizes his entire purpose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sunken library setting actively constrains choices—water levels force careful movement, the pressure lock requires specific knowledge, and the blackout creates urgency. Sensory details like "the slow breath of the ocean pressing against the glass dome" and "water...lapping at his knees" make the environment tactile and lived-in. The setting functions as more than backdrop, with the ocean's weight creating constant physical pressure that mirrors thematic tension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity about the stamp to discovering coordinates to finding his own name prophetically recorded, each revelation tightening options. The blackout deadline creates time pressure ("Surface teams would restore power soon"). However, the final choice to continue his work lacks the sharp cost or visible trade-off needed for higher bands—we understand intellectually but don't feel the price of his decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus erasure emerges through concrete action—Elias traces "lies woven into margins" and finds himself implicated in the very system he investigates. The concept of "reclaimed stillness" evolves from passive absence to active choice. The final lines "Some stillness wasn't meant to be shared / Some origins were honest only in the dark" offer resonant ambiguity without stating a moral, though the thematic weight could land harder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent intellectual precision through phrases like "tranquilly perceptive" and "meticulous script," with syntax reflecting Elias's methodical nature. The controlled, almost clinical tone effectively contrasts with the story's revelations. Minor repetition of "steady/even" descriptors creates slight monotony, but overall the voice distinctly characterizes a mind that processes shocking discoveries through scholarly distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity and momentum with varied sentence lengths and strong imagery like "waterlogged ledgers, their pages warped but still legible." However, filter verb clusters appear ("caught his eye," "felt like," "barely noticed") and some passages lean toward tell over show ("His motivation wasn't curiosity; it was deeper"). The writing is competent but lacks the razor precision needed for 8+ bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of a submerged library holding prophetic records offers genuine freshness, avoiding typical post-apocalyptic tropes. The twist—finding one's own future documented—emerges organically from established patterns. While the underwater setting and mysterious archive aren't wholly original, their specific execution through Elias's scholarly lens and the moral complexity of choosing ignorance over revelation elevates beyond formula.</comment>
