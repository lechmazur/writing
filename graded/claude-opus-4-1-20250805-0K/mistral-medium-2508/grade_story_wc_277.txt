<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lydia's internal conflict between regret and action drives meaningful choices, particularly her decision to break the "orbit" by publishing despite implicating her father. The characterization earns its closure through accumulated details (cufflinks, mother's pen, father's ledgers) that constrain her final choice with visible familial cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal structure: journalist's challenge → ledger discovery → plates arrival → decision to publish, with each beat narrowing Lydia's options. The closure lands as Decisive Change with clear cost (betraying father's memory to honor mother's work), though the plates' arrival timing feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting functions beyond decoration—its acoustics carry sound that matters ("clink of the caretaker's tea cup"), its brass telescopes and glass dome create atmospheric pressure, and the height metaphor ("two floors below") reinforces Lydia's isolation. The rosewood pen and zinc plates serve as tactile anchors that constrain choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from reputational doubt through familial betrayal to public truth-telling, with the ledger discovery forcing Lydia to choose between protecting her father's legacy or exposing corruption. The "orbit of regret" metaphor effectively tracks this escalation, though the plates' arrival reduces some earned tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The orbit metaphor elegantly develops from abstract concept to concrete action ("The orbit breaks here"), with the theme of cyclical regret versus intervention emerging through specific choices rather than declaration. The final tea toast reweights the opening's "weight of silence" without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice modulates between journalistic precision ("Final payment—V. Estate") and lyrical observation ("breath fog the glass dome above"), with controlled psychic distance that tightens during discovery moments. The perceptual signature—noting patterns, ledger details, physical objects—remains consistent with Lydia's observant nature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective variation ("The observatory hummed with the weight of silence" vs. short declaratives like "Her stomach twisted"), though some metaphor extensions feel slightly overwrought ("Regret was an orbit...you could trace its path forever"). Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The corruption-at-newspaper premise is familiar, but the specific synthesis of observatory setting, familial betrayal, and orbit metaphor creates fresh resonance. The twist that Lydia's father was complicit rather than merely victimized adds moral complexity, though the resolution feels slightly neat.</comment>
