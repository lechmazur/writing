<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eldrin's obsession with collecting silences drives concrete actions throughout—tracing gold leaf, pressing palm to stone, letting the booklet scatter. His final dissolution into "another layer of quiet" represents earned renunciation with visible cost (loss of human form). Internal contradictions between preserving and releasing manifest in physical gestures, though some moments edge toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered silences until Eldrin's dissolution creates Resonant Reconfiguration—he becomes what he sought to map. Cost is unmistakable: "no longer a man but another layer of quiet." Opening anchors who/where/when efficiently, and the pattern of collected silences builds coherently to the final transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint—the ridge fort's "bones" and "broken teeth" shape Eldrin's movements and choices. The fort absorbs and remembers silence "the way a shore holds the ghost of a tide," making environment inseparable from action. Gold leaf flaking onto skin creates tactile specificity that charges the final image of leaf caught in stone ridges.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Escalation operates through accumulative deepening—each silence adds weight until "the map was not in the recording but in the erasure." The dominant stake (mapping the endless night through silence) tightens when Eldrin realizes he must become part of the map rather than its creator. Cost manifests in his dissolution, though middle pressure could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of presence through absence—silences that map darkness, erasure that creates meaning. The final image of gold leaf glinting "in the memory of light" offers non-literal answer to how absence holds presence. Subtext operates through what's unspoken: the defender's name, the enemy that never came.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through silence-as-substance: "ambered hush," "silence could be a wound or a cradle." Lyric compression teaches its pattern early and maintains consistency. The shift from "His voice...was not a sound but a shape" demonstrates exceptional control of register under conceptual pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The pages whispered against his palms, their edges brittle as dried reeds" combines sound, texture, and fragility. Some figurative density in middle sections ("silence of her sword leaving its sheath") but pattern remains purposeful. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The conceit of an oracle who collects and retells silences rather than prophecies offers genuine freshness. Risk-taking in the dissolution ending and the choice to work entirely through absence/presence paradox elevates stakes. The synthesis of mapmaking through erasure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
