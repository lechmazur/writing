<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's functional creativity drives concrete choices throughout—jury-rigging the terminal's systems, repurposing rather than fixing, sketching solutions. Her internal contradiction between assigned duty and compulsive problem-solving creates genuine tension, particularly in "That was precisely why she'd come." The final renunciation of sleep for sketching shows earned character cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as Lena's discoveries layer into a resonant reconfiguration—the terminal transforms from abandoned ruin to pedestrian bridge. The closure lands with visible cost ("I'm recalibrating") and the sextant's integration drives the transformation. However, the middle section's hydroponics discovery feels slightly convenient, and the foreman scene adds unnecessary coda after the weather vane image provides stronger closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The terminal's architecture constrains choices brilliantly—"corridors looped back on themselves," the hydroponics system's stagnant water becoming the solution. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "trampled grass and the faint scent of burnt sugar," "algae-thick water." The sextant functions as micro-setting that enables the key transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through Lena's discoveries: finding the sextant, tracing its alignment with traveler desperation, activating the hydroponics, repurposing the terminal. The dominant stake—finding meaning in abandoned infrastructure—tightens as she transforms failure into function. Cost is visible in the town's lost belief and Lena's sleepless dedication, though the middle hydroponics beat lacks immediate resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the equation "Hope = Flow × Resistance" without moralizing. The carnival's extraction of belief parallels the terminal's abandonment, while Lena's redirection offers a non-literal answer: hope isn't destination but movement through. The weather vane's shift from stars to horizon crystallizes this reweighting perfectly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—Lena sees infrastructure as equations, dismantles "problems like rusted gears." Voice modulates effectively under discovery ("This wasn't just debris; it was a *key*"). The foreman dialogue feels slightly generic, but overall the engineering lens filters perception consistently.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong information density and varied rhythm, particularly in discovery sequences. However, several abstract phrases weaken precision: "hope itself had been a fleeting attraction," "intent, like a tool waiting for its purpose." Some repetitive structures appear ("She didn't fix... She repurposed," "She didn't cheer. She calculated") though they create purposeful cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of abandoned spaceport and civil engineer intern creates fresh angle—infrastructure as emotional archaeology. The sextant-as-key-to-failed-maze offers non-obvious solution, and "Hope = Flow × Resistance" equation provides memorable specificity. The carnival-as-hope-extractor premise feels slightly familiar but transforms through Lena's engineering lens.</comment>
