<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lila's internal conflict between mathematical certainty and intuitive leap drives genuine character evolution, with embodied tension ("palms stinging like she'd pressed them against something electric"). The final choice to "not choose" but let contradictions hold her represents earned transformation from her father's binary thinking. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional beats ("theoretically rebellious energy") that could be more viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught contradiction motif building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Lila steps into paradox itself. The closure lands with visible cost ("The mica pane cracked further") and conceptual repricing of luck as readable language. Orientation anchors who/where/when efficiently by line 3. Minor deduction for slight ambiguity in the library's dissolution sequences—the rules of traversal could be clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sensory specificity excels ("wet paper and old glue," "burnt clover") with the library setting constraining choice through its liminal quality. The mica lantern functions as micro-setting that enables traversal. Deduction for some spatial vagueness during the dissolution sequences and the infinite shelves moment that breaks coherence briefly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from following cryptic instructions to choosing between paths (gold/blue) to finally embracing contradiction itself—clear deepening under accumulative lens. The dominant stake (breaking from father's deterministic worldview) tightens through each lantern lighting with visible cost. Minor deduction for the middle dissolution feeling slightly consequence-free before the palm-stinging return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the gap "between what is and what should be," with the lantern's fractured mica embodying broken hypotheses. The final realization that "luck wasn't a lie, just a language" offers resonant answer without stating moral. Strong integration of gambling/probability metaphors throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled register ("the probability of her finding answers...was, frankly, insulting") and consistent POV. Perceptual signature strong in how Lila processes through mathematical frameworks. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in some metaphysical passages ("traverse them, step through the tear where logic frayed").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density high in opening paragraphs. Deductions for occasional abstraction ("theoretically rebellious energy") and some filter-verb clustering in middle sections ("she'd followed," "she'd ended up"). The "clover-melancholy" compound reads slightly forced.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of probability theory with magical realism creates non-obvious angle on parent-child inheritance themes. The subway scrawls as navigation system and the mica lantern as portal device show genuine invention. Risk-taking in the dissolution sequences and embrace of paradox elevates within band (+0.3).</comment>
