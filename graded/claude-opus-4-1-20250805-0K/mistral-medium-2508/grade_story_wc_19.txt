<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The child's internal conflict between safety/confinement and sprouting/freedom drives authentic choices, with contradictory impulses (staying down vs. climbing) acting simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation of the bunker/father carries visible cost ("Their father screamed. The child didn't look back"). Minor deduction for the father remaining somewhat opaque as pressure source.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing through silence flavors, gilded threads, and the trellis bloom culminating in a Decisive Change where the child abandons the bunker. Cost is visceral in the father's scream and bunker collapse. The "You were never the lock. You were the door" repricing lands with conceptual weight, though the father's "They're coming" introduces slight late ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bunker's "curved ribs" and rust-taste establish immediate claustrophobia that constrains choices throughout. The xenial trellis functions as counter-setting, its bone-white vines and honey-lightning silence creating tactile contrast. The gilded bloom and its "throbbing quiet" charge the final transformation, with environment directly enabling the sprouting ability.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through three inversions: discovery, climbing, then taking the bloom's silence. Each deepens the child's connection to the trellis while increasing distance from father/bunker. The gilded palm's "threads writhing like embers" creates irreversible change with clear cost in the father's wet gasps and final scream.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The silence-collection motif accumulates meaning from copper bunker-taste through frost-burn doll-silence to the bloom's "held note" quality, each flavor revealing the child's growing agency. "You were never the lock. You were the door" reweights twelve years of containment. The final image of biting the vine and tasting "beginning" offers resonant answer without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic silence-tasting ("coppery and thick, like licking a battery") and the child's selective attention to textures. Purposeful compression works through taught elision (mother never explained, father's past untold). Minor deduction for slight register elevation in "intangibly tangible" and "xenial" that briefly tensions the child-POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("safety was just another word for shrank"). Vivid specificity in "melted steeple," "threads writhing like embers." Some figurative density in peak beats ("wine" for silence, multiple taste metaphors) but pattern is taught early. Minor template echo in "They learned/They began/They pressed" sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The silence-collection conceit transforms the escape narrative through synesthetic specificity. The doll as frequency-key and the gravity inversions create non-obvious physics. "You were never the lock. You were the door" delivers conceptual surprise that feels inevitable given the child's liminal position. Risk-taking in the cryptic dialogue enhances rather than obscures.</comment>
