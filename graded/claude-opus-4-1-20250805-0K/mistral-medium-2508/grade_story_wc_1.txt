<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Liora's internal conflict between creation and unmaking drives genuine choices with embodied cost, particularly in "the frost had shown her one thing: the pauses were where the truth lived." The brother revelation forces contradictory impulses (pursuit vs. letting go) that play out through concrete action. Loses points for some abstract phrasing ("purpose was something you could melt and mold") and the final sections trending toward philosophical summary rather than embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (frost/glass/pauses) building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora releases the ledger and steps into "the quiet kind" of light. Cost is visible in letting the ledger fall—abandoning concrete evidence of her brother. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay (canyon location abstract initially) and some philosophical abstraction in final beats diluting the physical cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Frost patterns constrain choice and charge the final image—"the patterns remained, etched in her mind." The canyon's physical narrowing mirrors internal pressure. Sensory detail effectively filtered through artist's perception of light/fracture. Slight deduction for abstract "canyon" that never fully materializes spatially.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from artistic loss through brother's betrayal to choosing between pursuit and release. The ledger entry "pay in silver or the girl" effectively tightens pressure. Cost visible when she drops the ledger. However, the resolution's philosophical turn ("Maybe purpose wasn't in the making, but in the unmaking") softens what could be sharper physical consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of pauses/absence as meaning emerges through frost patterns, broken glass, and final release without explicit moralizing until late. The recurring pause motif effectively reweights from emptiness to fullness. Deduction for abstract statements like "Not to create, but to follow the lines already drawn" that approach thesis-speak in final third.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of glass artist seeing world through fracture/light. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats. However, register drift into philosophical abstraction ("the kind that lingers") in final section breaks from established concrete voice. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments like "frost...like forgotten script" and "molten tears." But template cadence appears: "She stepped...One step. Then another." Multiple philosophical abstractions in final third ("Not to create, but to follow..." "Maybe purpose wasn't in the making...") create paraphrase loops. Filter verb clusters ("She thought of," "She felt like") dull immediacy in closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass artist reading criminal ledger through frost patterns. The connection between artistic practice and moral reckoning feels earned. However, the philosophical resolution trends toward safe abstraction rather than bold specificity, particularly the extended meditation on purpose/pauses that could apply to many stories.</comment>
