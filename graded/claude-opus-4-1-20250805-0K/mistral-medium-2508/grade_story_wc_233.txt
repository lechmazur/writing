I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece with elements of Causal progression. The story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation (fireflies, starlight bleeding, crimson light) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the queen transforms into a constellation. I'll judge primarily under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The queen's transformation from skeptic to willing participant shows clear internal progression with embodied cost ("pain was exquisite, a thousand needles"). Her childhood bargain revelation creates genuine character depth. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "thing that had been a queen" rather than more concrete embodiment in the final beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the queen's transformation fulfills a childhood bargain, with visible cost ("bones hummed...veins filling with their fire"). The accumulative lens holds consistently through firefly/starlight motifs. The cyclical warning structure ("next queen") effectively reweights the opening. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in the transformation mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ember grotto setting actively constrains choices (forbidden climb, thin air) and charges the transformation. Strong sensory work ("air tasted of copper and old magic"). The cobalt stone and smoldering veins create vivid specificity. Deduction for some abstract elements ("curled in the back of the throat") that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from dreams to physical climb to transformation with clear cost. The fireflies' shift from guides to teeth shows meaningful intensification. The queen's agency drives the choice to "let the light take her." Minor deduction for the middle section's slightly looser pressure before the transformation beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional thematic integration of memory/bargains/patience without explicit moralizing. The final line "memory...was the kindest kind of bleeding" brilliantly reweights the entire piece. The cyclical structure (warning for the next queen) creates resonant complexity without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("jagged spine above the clouds where the air grew thin"). Strong perceptual signature in how the queen notices wrongness ("violet—wrong, like everything else here"). Minor deduction for occasional elevation that slightly exceeds the POV's established register ("constellation given flesh").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Some overwriting in places ("smoldering veins where the rock itself seemed to breathe") and occasional abstract constructions. The "thing that had been a queen" construction feels slightly workshop-worn. Information density is high but occasionally tips toward purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fairy tale bargain with cosmic transformation. The fireflies as teeth and the starlight-bleeding grotto show genuine originality. The cyclical structure with warnings passed between queens offers a non-obvious angle. Some familiar fantasy elements prevent higher scoring.</comment>
