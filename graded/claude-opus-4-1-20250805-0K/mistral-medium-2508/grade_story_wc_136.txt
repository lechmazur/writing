<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's obsessive need for precision as a defense against grief provides clear, consistent motivation that intensifies through his confession "I don't know where she went." The internal contradiction between mapping everything and accepting unknowability drives genuine struggle. Minor deduction for the sister's slightly convenient wisdom at closure, though the emotional cost of acknowledgment lands effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through cracks, mist, and mapping imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts mystery over certainty, with visible cost in releasing his sister. The phantom punch's transformation from tool to threshold and the vault's revelation as "moment not place" create earned causality. The closure's shift from solving to "carrying with trembling certainty" reweights the entire premise with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cracks-as-arrows motif constrains Elias's path and the vault's temporal lock ("precise hour when regret turned to resolve") shapes his access. The phantom punch's physical interaction with space itself and the suspended train platform create vivid, consequential settings. Slight deduction for the station's abstract destinations though they serve the conceptual frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through pattern recognition, vault entry, and the punch "biting" into reality itself, forcing Elias to name his core lie. The stakes tighten from external mystery to internal truth with clear cost in admitting ignorance about his sister's fate. The final choice to step back into uncertainty rather than toward answers demonstrates agency with visible renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between mapping/precision and accepting unmappable mysteries, culminating in "some paths aren't meant to be followed—only acknowledged." The final image of deliberate crease that "would never quite align" resonantly answers the central question without moralizing. Strong subtext in the phantom train carrying "things left unsaid."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines precise cartographic language with lyrical compression ("mist curled," "stars bleeding through like wounds"). The perceptual signature of seeing patterns and fractures everywhere reflects Elias's character. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("fortress of unspoken truths") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied rhythm, though some figurative density in peak moments ("stars above bleeding through like wounds") and occasional elevated diction ("yawned wider," "twilight") create minor friction. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. The final image of the crease effectively recharges earlier mapping motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapping obsession with grief processing, transformed through specific details like the phantom punch that marks absence rather than presence. The concept of precision as grief-avoidance and the vault as threshold moment rather than place shows genuine originality. The risk of lyrical density mostly pays off in supporting the trembling certainty between knowing and unknowing.</comment>
