<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lior's internal contradictions operate simultaneously throughout—his fingers twitch as his "tell" while he practices occlusion, and his choice to bury the eye rather than use or sell it crystallizes his values with visible cost. The eating of the truffle creates embodied sensory experience ("earth and rot and something like grief"), though some emotional states lean toward summary rather than full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Earned Stasis closure—Lior's burying of the eye forecloses the path to "revelation" with legible cost (his sister's death, the world's raw honesty). The constraint of the empathy virus shapes every tactic from occlusion to truffle-masking, and the final image of the ravine keeping secrets while he climbs away resonates with accumulated weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ravine and orchard function as active constraints—roots that will "swallow" the eye, mist patterns Lior has studied, fruit falling to specific wind pitches. Setting directly enables the concealment choice and charges the final image of stars "like pins in a black shroud," though some descriptive passages ("broken chandelier") edge toward ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to hide or reveal the eye's power—tightens through the warlord's men's arrival, forcing Lior's occlusion tactic. The cost is legible in his sister's suicide and the world's inability to lie, though the piece relies more on accumulated pressure than dramatic reversal, fitting its textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus kindness emerges through concrete particulars—the sister's line "We used to lie to be kind. Now kindness is the lie" reweights the entire premise. The final burial offers a non-literal answer that some truths are "better buried," with the ravine's secret-keeping charging the thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout—Lior notices textures ("rough as a scar"), counts time by mist patterns, processes grief through taste. The prose modulates effectively under pressure (shorter, sharper sentences during the warlord's men encounter), and the controlled elision about the sister's death pays off thematically.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The virus had stripped the world of artful deception, but it had also unspooled the threads of trust"). Some metaphoric density in opening passages ("broken chandelier," "saint's relic") without full payoff, and occasional filter constructions ("Lior's breath fogged") that could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The empathy virus that makes lying impossible but teaches occlusion instead offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic truth-telling. The specific synthesis of truffle-foraging, glass eye relic, and the distinction between lying and occluding creates an inevitable-feeling world logic, though some elements feel slightly familiar from dystopian templates.</comment>
