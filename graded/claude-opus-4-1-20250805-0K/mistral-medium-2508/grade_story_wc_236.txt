<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's loss of smell creates genuine constraint that shapes his interactions and worldview, with embodied contradictions between his former expertise and current limitation. The woman's trembling hands and Elias's tactile exploration of the screw show character through physical specificity. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract wisdom exchange that could use more embodied resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and object meditation build toward Elias's resonant reconfiguration about witnessing versus fixing. The closure lands with conceptual cost—accepting limitation as its own form of understanding. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Slight deduction for the middle section's reflection density that briefly stalls present-frame momentum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fog functions as both atmosphere and constraint, creating the "hush" that enables intimate exchange. Tactile details like "threads worn smooth as river stones" and the water clock's mechanical presence ground the scene. The shop's sensory void ("smelled of nothing and everything") constrains Elias's choices and charges the final witnessing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding versus fixing—develops through the woman's need and Elias's recognition of his new role. Pressure coheres as the screw's meaning shifts from tool to teaching object. The escalation is subtle but present: from examining object to reading gesture to accepting witness role. Missing a sharper cost moment that would elevate the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the screw's transformation from birthing tool to wisdom carrier—"the space between" words, tightening versus trusting. The final image of measuring life "between the hands that held and the hands that let go" resonates without stating a moral. Slight deduction for the somewhat explicit thematic articulation in Elias's dialogue about spaces and trust.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Elias's tactile focus and memory-based sensing. The rhythmic control in short, declarative sentences ("The clock dripped. The morning waited.") effectively modulates emotional beats. Free indirect style clean throughout with purposeful fragments at closure that enhance rather than obscure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"fog curled through the alley like breath on glass" establishes setting, atmosphere, and metaphoric register. Sentence variety and rhythm support scene momentum. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("ordinary miracles," "emotional terrain") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The aromatherapist-without-smell creates genuine irony that drives character and theme. The midwife's screw as wisdom object rather than medical tool offers fresh angle on inherited knowledge. The water clock repair setting provides unique metaphor for time's flow versus measurement. Some safety in the resolution's wisdom-exchange prevents higher scoring.</comment>
