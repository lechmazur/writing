<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to "patch the holes in her soul" drives consistent choices through bartering memories and guilt, with internal contradiction shown through her recklessness despite warnings. The final choice to trade her deepest guilt (the child's name) for freedom lands with visible cost, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("holes in her soul") rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through layered trades and root/bone imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora accepts her scars as "hers to carry." The orchard's rules establish clear causality (trades extracted/given), and the closure lands with felt cost as she walks away "lighter" but still scarred. Minor orientation wobble with "corridors" appearing late without clear spatial logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard setting actively constrains choices through its trade mechanics—roots that "split skulls" and drink from bones create visceral atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective (damp sighs, half-lit glow, rain on dry earth) and the environment shapes the final walking-away image, though some spatial elements like "corridors" feel disconnected from the established orchard space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—trading away pain versus keeping identity—escalates through the needle-stitching ritual to the roots pulling at "the thing she'd hidden deepest." Cost is visible when she trades the child's name for freedom, with the white flower as tangible evidence. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, though the mysterious voice adds complication without full payoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the bartered destinies concept: what we give up shapes who we become. The white flower "soft as a child's sigh" resonates without stating meaning, and Liora's acceptance that scars are "not gaps to fill" offers a non-literal answer to the premise. The recurring trade imagery accumulates meaning, particularly in "The dead slept easier with their bargains kept."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("breathed in the slow, damp sighs") and character-specific perception (seeing roots as veins, touching "fiercely gentle"). Dialogue between Liora and Veyra feels natural with subtext about recklessness. Some register elevation in places ("trammel fate itself") slightly exceeds the established voice range, and the mysterious voice moment feels underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments of compression ("roots twisting like veins through the ribs of the forgotten") but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "holes in her soul"/"patch the holes"/"gaps to fill" recycles the same concept. Template cadence appears in the ending ("Somewhere, a root split another bone. / Somewhere, a new trade began.") though it creates intentional rhythm. Information density varies, with some lines doing multiple jobs while others merely restate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The bartered destinies concept offers a fresh angle on dealing with trauma—trading specific memories/guilt for transformation rather than simple healing. The catacomb orchard as a place that "thrived on bartered destinies" creates an original world-logic. Execution stays within familiar literary gothic territory without significant risk-taking, though the specific detail of stitching ashes into bark shows imaginative precision.</comment>
