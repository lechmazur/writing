<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena's motivation to bridge entangled memories through self-modification is clear and drives the closure with visible cost. The contradiction between her precise engineering mind and chaotic pursuit of buried connections creates genuine tension. However, the emotional specificity of her losses (failed prototypes, lover, never-had child) reads more as catalog than embodied experience, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Lena transforms from engineer/archeologist to "cartographer of the entangled dark," with the cost visible in her physical collapse and acceptance of fractured memories. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and memory fragments build toward this crystallization. The closure lands with felt cost as she embraces the fractures rather than seeking precision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The canyon setting functions as both physical space and metaphorical threshold, with the fractured mirror constraining and enabling Lena's exploration. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("ozone and old rust," "liquid white" moon). The environment actively shapes the final transformation, though some descriptions lean toward the ornamental ("fractured ribs," "silver scalpel").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering/integrating lost memories—escalates through Lena's active modification of the mirror and herself, culminating in her acceptance of entanglement over abandonment. The progression from seeing her reflection to stranger's memories to full integration shows meaningful deepening. However, the lack of immediate opposition or complication limits the pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of memory as entanglement rather than storage emerges organically through concrete action with the mirror and neural modifications. The final image of Lena as "cartographer of the entangled dark" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The canyon-as-wound metaphor and the transformation from precision to embracing fractures create thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent lyrical-technical register appropriate to Lena's engineer-philosopher perspective, with controlled modulation during the memory cascade. Perceptual signature is strong ("helix of equations," "chaotically precise"). Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("moon's silver scalpel," "quantum foam of decision and regret") but remain within the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythm and varied syntax, with effective information density in most passages. However, several instances of overwriting appear ("quantum foam of decision and regret," "fractured ribs under the moon's silver scalpel") and some conceptual redundancy ("abandoned dreams" appears twice). The final third maintains momentum despite these ornamental tendencies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of memory as quantum entanglement offers a fresh angle on the familiar theme of confronting the past. The specific synthesis of neural engineering with archeology of memory feels earned. However, the treatment occasionally relies on sci-fi abstractions ("quantum foam," "synaptic plasticity") rather than fully grounded specificity.</comment>
