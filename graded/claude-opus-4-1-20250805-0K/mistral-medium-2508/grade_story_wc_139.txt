I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Hybrid (Causal dominant with Accumulative elements). The story follows causal linkage (Lira discovers ledger → writes names → ink transforms reality) but incorporates accumulative density through the ink's growing weight and symbolic resonance.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her desire to find "the equation for a trade that didn't rot," with concrete internal conflict shown through her hesitation before writing. The girl character provides immediate pressure that forces Lira's choice. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract resolution of debt dissolution without fully embodied emotional cost in the final moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the ink dissolves rigid debt structures and Lira chooses collective math over individual accounting ("They added up to *them*"). The causal chain holds from ledger discovery through ink transformation to border crossing. Slight deduction for the magical realism element not being fully taught before its climactic use.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room constrains choices effectively—the embalming table, ink pot, and mortuary setting all participate in the transformation. Sensory details like "porcelain surface streaked with ghosts of names" and ink that "moved, thick as blood" create atmosphere. The setting actively shapes the story's resolution through the ink pot's properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (cleaning up father's mess) to collective (twelve refugee lives) with the girl's arrival forcing immediate action. The dominant stake—finding fair trade mathematics—tightens when Lira realizes "twelve for *her*" was the real equation. Cost becomes visible when the pot shatters and transforms the space, though the physical/emotional price could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mathematics metaphor—from con artist calculations to collective accounting. The serpent eating its tail motif pays off when Lira becomes endless like the symbol. The final insight that "the only fair trade was the one that refused to be counted" resonates without moralizing, reweighting all prior transactional logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on mathematical/transactional details fitting Lira's background. The girl's dialogue carries authentic urgency ("You count what's missing"). Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("porcelain surface streaked with ghosts") that slightly exceeds the established voice range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments like "ink pot tucked into her coat like a second heartbeat" and maintains momentum through varied sentence structure. Deductions for filter verb clusters ("Lira knew," "she thought") and some overwriting in metaphorical density ("the serpent had no end. Neither, now, did she") that slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of mathematical fairness in con artistry offers a fresh angle, with the ink pot that dissolves debt providing an inventive magical realist element. The transformation from individual to collective accounting feels earned. The ending's rejection of countable trades in favor of unmeasurable connection shows genuine insight beyond surface cleverness.</comment>
