I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's contradictory impulses—clutching dried flowers while whittling them away—embody grief's paradox effectively. The scream as raw release against performed stillness earns its emotional cost. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "remade hush pressed into bones" early on, but the character work recovers strongly through concrete gesture and choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly: from enforced silence to chosen silence, with the gift of dried flowers marking genuine connection. Cost is visible in "something like fear, something like hope" and the three-year weight of the Mandate's aftermath. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the Mandate backstory could integrate more smoothly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Wind turbines as "slow, indifferent gods" establish atmosphere effectively and return meaningfully. The farmhouse's groaning walls and dust exhalation create lived-in specificity. Setting constrains through the porch's splintered wood and empty spaces, though the turbines could more actively shape choices beyond framing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—breaking free from enforced emotional suppression—escalates through Lena's scream and the offering to teach whittling. The happiness tin discovery deepens pressure effectively. Cost registers in Harkin's fear/hope response, though the middle section could tighten pressure more decisively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the distinction between performed happiness and chosen silence, with "it's easier to carry grief when your hands are busy" offering earned wisdom. The final image of working in chosen silence powerfully reweights the opening's enforced stillness without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent distance with strong perceptual signature in "blades cutting the sky into rhythmic slices of silence." Dialogue feels natural with effective subtext ("Still carving?"/"Still breathing?"). Minor register elevation in "sacred act of rebellion" doesn't quite fit the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments like "curls of wood falling like shed skin" but suffers from some overwriting ("mechanical mourning," "tangled into something unnameable"). Several filter constructions ("she recognized," "which was as close as") dull immediacy. The paraphrase of theme in "easier to carry grief when your hands are busy" edges toward explicit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Happiness Mandate as dystopian backdrop offers fresh context for grief exploration. The transformation from performer to grief-carrier shows specificity. The synthesis of enforced happiness versus chosen silence feels earned, though the concept could push further beyond familiar post-dystopian territory.</comment>
