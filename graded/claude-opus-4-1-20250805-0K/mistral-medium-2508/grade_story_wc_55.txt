<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scribe's internal contradiction between preserving silence and releasing his unfinished work drives a meaningful renunciation with visible cost. His choice to break the crystal and reassemble the orrery despite elder condemnation shows clear motivation rooted in the "petrichor nostalgia" that "unraveled something in him." The final image of him letting silence "measure him" rather than measuring it demonstrates earned transformation through concrete action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the orrery's assembly and the crystal's fracturing, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the scribe releases his dream rather than abandoning it. Cost is visible in the broken forecourt and his acceptance of being called "ruin" by the elders. The pattern of whispers-to-chimes creates clear before/after legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt constrains choice by preserving the "echoes of his own unfinished work" and enabling the final assembly when he cracks it open. Setting details like "the tower's heart" ticking and the "soundless sanctuary" create atmospheric pressure that shapes his decision. The forecourt's transformation from pristine to fractured mirrors and enables his internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to complete the forbidden orrery—intensifies through the crystal's whispers revealing themselves as "echoes of his own unfinished work." His choice to crack the crystal and arrange the pieces "not as they should have been, but as they had always wanted to be" shows agency foreclosing the path of obedience with visible cost in the broken forecourt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of creative expression versus institutional silence emerges through concrete actions: pressing his ear to glass, cracking crystal, assembling forbidden gears. The final image of letting silence "measure him" rather than measuring it offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The orrery's imperfect assembly "alive" rather than harmonious deepens the theme of authentic creation over prescribed perfection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, though occasional elevation ("glacial hush," "petrichor nostalgia") slightly strains the scribe's presumed lexicon. Strong perceptual signature in how he notices time through sound ("each tick of the tower's heart") and texture ("crystal sighed beneath his bare feet"). Some filter verb accumulation ("he realized," "he knew") dulls immediacy in middle passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "the whispers were messages"/"the glass would confess" and "preserved them"/"preserved the hush" restate without advancement. Template cadence appears in "He rose...stepped...Kneeling, he pressed" sequence. The closing image achieves strong propulsion with "The orrery tick-tick-ticked, and the world answered."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of measuring silence/stillness between heartbeats offers a fresh angle on creative suppression. The specific synthesis of clockwork, crystal acoustics, and heretical timekeeping feels non-obvious yet inevitable. The transformation of whispers from external messages to internal echoes shows genuine ingenuity in reweighting familiar material.</comment>
