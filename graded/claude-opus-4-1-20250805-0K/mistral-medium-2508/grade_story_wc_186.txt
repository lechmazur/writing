<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The custodian's motivation is grounded in concrete loss (mother's death) and the contradictory impulse between accepting solitude and seeking connection through the beacon drives the closure choice. Her retrocognitive gift creates genuine internal conflict—seeing "pasts you'd missed" embodies the pain of knowledge without agency. The final choice to continue seeking "echoes" of the future despite uncertainty shows earned endurance with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught resonance between the prism's fractures and personal loss, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the beacon's flare reweights all prior coincidences into meaningful design. The closure lands with felt cost: "She didn't know if anyone was left to see the beacon. But that wasn't the point." establishes the price of continuing despite isolation. The causal chain from touching prism → tracing star paths → beacon flare → rain's arrival creates coherent escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass tower's "humming" walls and star-path carvings constrain the protagonist's actions—she must trace specific grooves to activate the beacon. Sensory hierarchy reflects her custodian expertise: she notices the prism's "hush" making her teeth ache, the pavilion's breathing quality, and the way light falls in constellation patterns. The post-apocalyptic setting pressures every choice through isolation and scarcity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving meaning exists in coincidence—escalates from personal memory (mother's face in the first flare) to cosmic pattern (the beacon revealing design in collapse). The prism's mending represents a meaningful deepening that reweights all prior "coincidences" as intentional design. Cost is legible in her acceptance that connection may never come: "She didn't know if anyone was left to see the beacon."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete parallel between the prism's fractures and life's broken patterns, both containing a "hush" that can still generate light. The final insight—"it had never been about bringing the past back...but seeing the shape of it"—reframes the entire narrative without stating a moral. The recurring motif of coincidence-as-design earns its weight by constraining her choice to continue despite isolation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature: the custodian notices through retrocognitive filtering, seeing "echoes of what had been" in present objects. Rhythmic control intensifies during the beacon sequence with shorter, breathless sentences ("The prism groaned. Then, with a sound like a held breath released, it *mended*"). The lyric compression serves the accumulative design without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high—most sentences advance both external action and internal revelation simultaneously. Some metaphorical density in peak beats ("thistle-blown moment") approaches overwriting but remains coherent. Minor template cadence in the final sequence ("Tomorrow, she'd...Tomorrow, she'd...") and slight paraphrase loop between "the pavilion's song fading behind her, but not gone. Never gone." costs precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with mystical technology and retrocognition creates a non-obvious angle on loss and meaning-making. The specific detail that the beacon's light matches "the constellations...exactly as they'd been the night her mother was born" transforms generic coincidence into lived particularity. The risk of leaving the ending open (no confirmation anyone sees the beacon) heightens rather than diminishes stakes.</comment>
