<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation as a collector of souls is clear and embodied through specific sensory details (souls as "quiet hum," "tuning fork vibrates against bone"). The laughing soul's desire to be "the joke, not the punchline" reveals authentic complexity. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution where spreading petals immediately triggers the needed connection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the harp's transformed music—notes remain "distorted, but now they *harmonized*"—with visible cost in the soul's integration rather than release. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the final image of carried laughter. The orientation anchors (Liora, Echo Gorge, dawn) establish clearly within the first 50 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The misaligned harp functions as both setting and constraint, its "strings stretched at odd angles" creating the distorted notes that shape the entire interaction. The gorge itself participates—"walls no longer leaning in but standing tall"—showing environment changed by the resolution. Sensory details (wet earth, gold mist, cracked harp string) are selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—integrating rather than releasing the soul—deepens when Liora realizes "some souls didn't need release. They needed *integration*." The cost appears in the soul becoming part of "the story of the stones and the water," foreclosing traditional release. The escalation through laughter (broken→chorus→echoes) follows the accumulative lens coherently.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of integration versus release emerges through concrete action—scattering petals, sharing a joke—rather than declaration. The crocodile tooth carrying "memory" not "power" reinforces that healing comes through connection, not force. The final image of echoes laughing offers a non-literal answer to whether grief must mean separation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature appears in phrases like "seep into Echo Gorge" and "tuning fork vibrates against bone." The spectral dialogue maintains naturalistic indirection ("I haven't done that in a hundred years"). Minor deduction for slight register elevation in "integration—the stitching of joy back into the fabric of their endings" that briefly breaks POV consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong rhythm variation and information density in lines like "He hadn't wept. He'd laughed." Template cadence appears in the "Liora didn't..." repetitions (didn't startle/didn't ask), though used purposefully for character establishment. Mixed metaphor slightly strains in "fabric of their endings" combined with musical motifs throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The reversal of soul collection—integration rather than release—offers fresh perspective on the ghost story trope. The specific synthesis of misaligned music creating harmony through imperfection feels earned. The crocodile joke provides unexpected levity that transforms the haunting into healing.</comment>
