<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora's curiosity drives meaningful action under pressure, with her pattern-recognition shifting from transgression to salvation. The character shows genuine embodied tension ("breath fogging the glass," "pulse jumped") and makes costly choices that risk captain's anger for potential discovery. However, the crew's instant acceptance of her solution feels slightly unearned given their weeks of grumbling about omens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Liora's pattern-recognition transforms the ship from trapped to free, with cost visible in weeks of drift and crew desperation. The hopscotch board functions as both literal navigation tool and metaphorical key, teaching its pattern early and paying off through physical escape. Causality holds throughout, though the magical mechanics of "stranded luminance" could be slightly more grounded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The airship setting constrains choices effectively—engines failing, limited fuel, crew trapped in repetitive loops. Sensory details like "brass portholes," "warped navigation charts," and starling shadows create atmospheric pressure. The hopscotch board as micro-setting directly enables the resolution, though some spatial choreography between captain's study and deck could be clearer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal transgression to ship-wide survival as Liora connects the phrasebook phrase to the glowing hopscotch pattern. The engine failures create genuine urgency, and Veyra's shift from anger to trust marks meaningful pressure. Cost is visible in weeks of drift and depleted resources, though the resolution comes perhaps too smoothly once the pattern is recognized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the interplay of "stranded luminance," pattern-recognition, and finding home through careful observation. The phrasebook's "Where light lingers, the lost find home" gains resonance as literal navigation wisdom. The ending reframes being stranded as opportunity for discovery, with Liora's final line "Here, the sky remembers" offering non-literal thematic closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on patterns and light, fitting a map apprentice's mindset. Dialogue feels natural with subtext (Veyra's "Show me how to jump" carries both skepticism and desperate hope). Some filter phrases ("She thought of," "She noted") could be trimmed, and occasional elevated diction ("luminous," "vast") slightly exceeds Liora's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves solid momentum with varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks marking scene shifts. Information density is generally strong, though some passages contain mild redundancy ("The crew cheered... but Liora stayed"). Minor template cadence appears in repeated "She [verb]" constructions, and the extended denouement after escape slightly dilutes impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The hopscotch navigation system offers fresh specificity to the trapped-ship trope, with pattern-recognition as salvation feeling earned through Liora's established character trait. The synthesis of children's game with cosmic navigation creates memorable imagery. While individual elements are familiar (airship, apprentice, mysterious book), their combination through "stranded luminance" feels distinctive.</comment>
