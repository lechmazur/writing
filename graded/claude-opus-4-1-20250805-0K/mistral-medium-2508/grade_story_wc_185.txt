<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eldrin's motivation to preserve the caves' memory is clear and consistent, with embodied details like fingers tracing walls and the stone warming against skin. The final choice to listen rather than resist shows earned renunciation with visible cost—the caves transforming into something new. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("library," "preservation") that could be more viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the bloom of hush transforming from weapon to invitation to growing harmony—a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost as the caves permanently change. The pattern of listening/reading/mapping holds throughout, and the final image of Eldrin resting while the storm becomes a lullaby crystallizes the reconfigured world. Slight deduction for the cost being more conceptual than visceral in places.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The harmonic caves function as both setting and constraint, with ice fractures recording disturbance and the echo chamber stone drawing quiet "like water from a well." Spatial details like the fissure splitting between Eldrin's knees ground the action. The environment directly shapes tactics—examining ice patterns to find the eye of the storm—and charges the final image of transformed caves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: beings arrive → Eldrin reads fractures → conjures bloom → beings recoil → harmonization begins. The dominant stake (preserving the caves' essence) deepens when the bloom becomes "not a wall, but a door," forcing both sides to adapt. Cost is legible as the caves transform permanently, though the tension could tighten more sharply at the peak moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of listening versus resistance, with the bloom of hush as invitation rather than weapon. The final image of mutual listening and the storm becoming a lullaby resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral. Strong subtext in "hammered into repose" and the ripple-marks rewriting themselves. Minor deduction for slightly abstract framing of "conversation" and "language."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through Eldrin's sensory focus on vibration, texture, and geological memory. Strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths matching emotional beats. Some filter verbs ("understood," "felt") slightly dull immediacy in places. The voice maintains consistency through pressure, though a few moments of elevated diction ("harmonic caves had always hummed with the breath of the world") slightly exceed the POV's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied rhythm. Information density is solid—most lines advance multiple purposes. Several instances of abstract phrasing ("library," "preservation," "conversation") that could be more concrete. Minor repetition of "bloom of hush" without sufficient variation. The "smiled" beat feels slightly stock. Strong closing sequence from "Eldrin exhaled" onward with good propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of hostile energy beings creating a "storm" that must be met with invitation rather than resistance offers a fresh angle on first contact. The specific method of reading geological memory through ice fractures is original. The transformation from conflict to harmonization through the bloom of hush as "door not wall" subverts expected confrontation. Some elements feel slightly familiar (caves as repository of memory) but the synthesis works.</comment>
