<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dye master's journey from borrowed heart to authentic rhythm shows clear motivation through concrete embodied details—the heart "thudded against his ribs, not in fear, but recognition." The transformation from passive recipient to active conduit of stories earns its cost through specific choices, though some interior passages edge toward abstraction ("hollows that ached to be filled").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds consistently as images and encounters build toward the Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts his role as story-facilitator, with clear cost: "He painted until his arms burned, until the wing dissolved into his palm." The closure lands with the heart settling into "its new rhythm, no longer borrowed, but his own," though the middle journey section could tighten its causality between villages.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating tea house and morpho wing create immediate atmospheric specificity, with setting constraining choices—the protagonist must leave via "suspension bridge, the valley yawning below." The wing's physical dissolution into his palm and the mist that "swallowed the first words of his journey" make environment inseparable from transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal understanding to communal healing as the protagonist discovers his power isn't to tell stories but to help others find theirs—"the hollows that ached to be filled with color and caution." The physical cost accumulates ("painted until his arms burned") though the middle village sequence could sharpen its specific pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of the wing's meaning—from gift to tool to dissolution—as the protagonist learns stories aren't magnetized but recognized in people's gaps. The final image of silence as "invitation" resonates without stating its moral, though the explicit thematic statement about "cracks in people where stories needed to be" edges toward directness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with selective perception ("iridescence flickering like a held breath") and controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The woman's dialogue carries genuine subtext ("You're looking for the why"), though occasional register elevation ("the quiet explosion of being seen") slightly exceeds the established range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong imagery and momentum with lines like "mist curled through the gaps, thick enough to mute the world below." Some figurative density in peak moments ("color and caution and the quiet explosion of being seen") and occasional abstract phrasing ("hollows that ached to be filled") create minor friction without breaking clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of a transplant heart carrying its owner's gift transforms through specific execution—the dye that moves on paper, stories emerging through painted patterns on cobblestones. While the core concept isn't wholly original, the synthesis of elements (dye master, butterfly wing, floating tea house) creates a distinctive whole.</comment>
