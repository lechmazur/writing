I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's motivation crystallizes through concrete details—the bleeding palm, the phobia she's conquered professionally, the betrayal that erases her legal existence. The child character applies immediate pressure that forces Lena to act despite her vulnerability. Minor deduction for the child's somewhat convenient appearance and cryptic knowledge ("They lied to you too") that feels slightly unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal drive with clear closure: Lena transforms from erased victim to agent of her own proof through the ledger discovery. The shell's whispers → cast message → ledger location creates a because/therefore chain. Cost is visible in the blood price and the acceptance of fear ("fear wasn't the enemy. It was the current you learned to ride"). Slight deduction for the child's unexplained knowledge weakening mid-story causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rusted library with sagging shelves creates immediate atmosphere, and small details like the "grimy cast scrawled with smudged crayon" ground the scene. The physical environment constrains choice when Lena must climb the groaning ladder. However, spatial choreography occasionally blurs (where exactly does the child come from?) and the library's ownership history feels inserted rather than organic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from physical threat (footsteps) to existential (erasure) to agency (reclaiming proof). The dominant stake—proving Lena exists—tightens through the shell's guidance and the ledger discovery. Cost is paid in blood and in accepting vulnerability as strength. Minor deduction for the child's challenge ("You gonna let him win?") feeling slightly manufactured rather than emerging from established pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: vulnerability as power manifests in Lena's blood offering and her final understanding that "the very things they called weaknesses were the cracks that let the light in." The water phobia transforms from limitation to metaphor for navigation. Slight deduction for the near-explicit thematic statement in the penultimate paragraph that borders on telling what's been shown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm ("cliff dives with frayed ropes, car flips with faulty harnesses") and character-specific perception. Dialogue feels natural with subtext ("Yeah, well. I'm good at breaking rules"). Some filter verb accumulation ("Lena hesitated," "Lena moved") and occasional register elevation ("The betrayal coiled tighter") that doesn't fully match the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation and strong specific details. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "She wasn't Jacob's shadow. She wasn't the studio's liability" repeats the erasure concept. Template cadence appears in the final section with multiple "She [verb]" constructions. Mixed metaphor with water as both feared element and navigational current slightly muddies the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on identity theft through the stunt double profession, making vulnerability literal through physical risk. The child with the smudged cast message is an inventive touch. The synthesis of shell mythology with contract fraud creates an unexpected blend. Loses some points for the somewhat convenient magical realism of the whispering shell that provides exact instructions.</comment>
