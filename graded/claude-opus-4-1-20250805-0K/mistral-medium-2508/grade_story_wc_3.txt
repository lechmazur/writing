I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and metaphysical exploration rather than strict causal linkage, with the final transformation serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's grief-driven pursuit crystallizes through concrete details like "hands steady as a metronome" and the embodied absence of the spirit. The final choice to return "not to stay, but to understand" demonstrates earned acceptance with visible cost—he experiences his wife alive yet must leave again.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's transformed relationship to loss—"held now in a light that let him see both at once." The accumulative pattern of translation/transition metaphors coheres, though the cost could be more viscerally felt in the reunion scene itself rather than implied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Sky Arbor's inverted physics ("roots tangled in the storm-wracked heavens") creates a world where transition is physical law, directly enabling the story's conceptual exploration. The magnetic pull on tools and the "sap that glowed faintly, as if embarrassed by its own luminosity" demonstrate exceptional integration of setting with theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from linguistic puzzle to metaphysical transformation, with the seed's planting creating genuine pressure—"the world tilted... not sideways, but through." The cost manifests in Elias's acceptance that he cannot stay with his resurrected wife, though this renunciation could carry more immediate weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the sustained metaphor of translation as transition—"finding the shape of one truth in the negative space of another." The final insight "Some doors only open when you stop knocking" reweights the entire narrative without moralizing, achieving genuine resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains scholarly precision ("wedge-shaped script that had outlasted empires") while allowing lyrical flights that match Elias's emotional state. The controlled shift when reality bends—"stepped into a reflection and found it deeper than the original"—demonstrates strong modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("the fingers of a god testing the weight of mortality") but occasionally overreaches with density—three metaphors stack in the spirit's description alone. Some transitions feel abrupt (the two-day climb compressed to one line), though momentum generally holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of translation as metaphysical transition offers genuine freshness, avoiding expected ghost-story tropes. The inverted arbor and the "physics of leaving" create an original cosmology that serves character rather than ornament.</comment>
