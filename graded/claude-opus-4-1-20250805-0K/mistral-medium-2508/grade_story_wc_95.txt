<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Characters show genuine internal contradiction (Elias's mechanical precision vs philosophical flexibility, Liora's calculated smirk vs genuine eagerness), and the final partnership choice carries visible cost—they abandon the Council verdict they waited three days for. The "fierce minds could fence with shadows and still walk away partners" lands with earned weight. Slight deduction for the convenience of Liora's twelve-year-old code being exactly what's needed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (Causal-Accumulative) holds: the duel accumulates meaning through coded moves until the sundial revelation triggers causal change—from opponents to partners. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (abandoning the Council verdict). The "lock's been broken for decades" line crystallizes that their philosophical debate was always theater; the real negotiation happens through blade-work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass atrium's "shattered diamonds" light and the sundial's shadow-angles constrain the duel's choreography and enable the coded communication. The needle card's precise landing "where the shadow split VII and VIII" matters causally. Deduction for some ornamental description ("damp earth and crushed mint") that doesn't pressure choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from philosophical debate to physical duel to partnership negotiation, with each thrust carrying diplomatic weight. The needle card's trajectory, the sundial strike revealing the hidden key, and the decision to abandon the Council verdict all tighten options with visible cost. The "real answer had been here all along" pays off the three-day wait.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of fencing as negotiation—"each thrust and parry a clause in an unspoken treaty." The story rejects binary opposition (waiting vs acting, questions vs destinations) for synthesis through partnership. The final image of "one whole, one augmented, both unbroken" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV maintains close third on Elias with consistent perceptual signature (mechanical precision, philosophical framing). Dialogue carries strong subtext—"Destinations" as correction, "The brook doesn't stall. It *waits*"—though some exchanges feel slightly mannered. Minor deduction for both characters occasionally converging toward similar articulate registers under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful syntax ("A coded overture" as fragment for emphasis). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("like shattered diamonds," "as calculated as the angles") and occasional register elevation ("curdled into something fiercer"). The paraphrase loop "Took you long enough"/"First door on the left" could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sundial-as-coded-negotiation-space offers fresh specificity, transforming a standard duel through the mechanical arm detail and the twelve-year-old hidden message. The synthesis of physical combat with philosophical debate through literal geometric angles shows genuine ingenuity. Risk-taking in the elliptical revelation structure pays off.</comment>
