<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's guilt manifests through embodied contradictions—the cold brass cuff against the watch hand he "wasn't supposed to keep," his measured exhales against client grief while carrying seven years of self-deception. The final choice to meet Harkin despite knowing the danger shows earned agency with visible cost, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("the weight of a withheld truth had finally tipped the scales").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through layered images (cobalt terrace, driftwood bones, watch hand) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias finds Harkin's note dated tomorrow—crystallizing his complicity and forcing action. Cost is felt through "each step echoing like a name called out too late," though the precise nature of Harkin's disappearance remains deliberately elusive, which slightly weakens causal clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and driftwood shore create atmospheric pressure—tiles "slick with ocean mist," carved figures "warm as a pulse." The setting actively participates when the driftwood splits to reveal Harkin's note, constraining Elias's choice. Some descriptions verge on overwriting ("stretched like a bruise") but mostly serve the accumulative texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pressure builds through accumulation—from passive guilt-carrying to active disposal of the watch hand, triggering the driftwood's revelation. The stake (confronting truth about Harkin) tightens when tomorrow's date forces immediate decision. However, escalation relies heavily on coincidence (the driftwood splitting) rather than protagonist agency, limiting the score despite felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the "siege of hush"—how manufacturing false histories corrupts the fabricator. The watch hand becomes Elias's "penance," and the sea keeping secrets "not with malice, but because some things, once spoken, could never be unsaid" offers resonant complexity. The ending reweights his professional skill against personal guilt without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains literary density with controlled rhythm—"stitching lies into bloodlines for coin, grafting false grandparents onto orphaned heirs." The perceptual signature shows Elias reading patterns in driftwood and hearing accusations in waves. Some passages edge toward purple prose, but syntax effectively modulates with emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful imagery. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "stretched like a bruise," "slithered into his thoughts," and repetitive conceptual phrasing around "withheld truth" and "weight." The filter-heavy construction "he realized he'd never once tried" dulls immediacy in a key realization moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The genealogist-as-memory-forger premise offers fresh angle on identity and truth. The specific detail of "grafting false grandparents onto orphaned heirs" and the watch hand as physical guilt-token avoid generic treatment. While competent, the resolution doesn't risk enough—Elias's decision to meet Harkin follows expected emotional logic rather than surprising transformation.</comment>
