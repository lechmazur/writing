<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pip's "steadily curious" nature drives concrete choices throughout—testing new wings despite repeated crashes, prying free the arrow to use as compass, conducting rather than falling. The yearning algorithm as internal contradiction works well, though the final transformation ("conducting" the air) edges toward unearned epiphany without sufficient embodied struggle in that specific moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Pip transforms from falling to "conducting," with the workshop's destruction as visible cost. The kaleidoscope visions effectively forecast and pay off the transformation. Deduction for slight ambiguity in how exactly the arrow enables the conducting shift—the mechanism could be clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The acid sea constrains every choice—forcing workshop elevation, eating brass ribs, threatening each test flight. Strong micro-setting work with the arrow tip as recurring object that transforms from wound to compass to integrated component. The workshop's physical degradation mirrors Pip's evolution effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation follows accumulative pattern: repeated crashes into acid sea, kaleidoscope revelation, arrow integration, then conducting breakthrough with workshop destruction as cost. The "first draft" reframing shows agency in accepting destruction. Minor deduction for the conducting shift feeling slightly sudden despite setup.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through iteration and failure as creative method—the workshop as prayer, crashes as drafts, destruction as progress. The "bell no one hears yet" effectively captures innovation's isolation. Strong resonance in treating wreckage as necessary rather than failure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blending technical vocabulary ("bicycle chains," "grease pencil") with lyrical compression ("rusted prayer," "dissolved into the sea"). Perceptual signature strong—Pip notices mechanical details and possibilities others miss. The inventive verb choices ("transliterate gravity," "conducting" air) elevate without obscuring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The workshop hung above the acid sea like a rusted prayer" establishes setting, stakes, and tone simultaneously. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful compression. Minor deduction for occasional density that requires re-reading ("the vibration of the thing").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk elements with artistic creation metaphor—the workshop as draft, crashes as revision. The "yearning algorithm" as mechanical description of artistic drive is particularly inventive. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode and experimental punctuation enhances rather than obscures.</comment>
