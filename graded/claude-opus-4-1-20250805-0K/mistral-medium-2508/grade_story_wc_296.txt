<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eldrin's motivation to find his brother drives concrete choices through the seed-planting and confrontation with the lake-entity, with embodied tension in "hands were steady" while discovering the painful truth of his brother's voluntary jump. The cost of knowing ("weight of knowing pressing him flatter than any blade could") lands with specificity, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("finder of things that wished to stay hidden").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-breaks that reweight meaning: the lake's transformation from wound to conscious keeper, the seed's digestion revealing truth, and Eldrin's shift from seeker to bearer of unwanted knowledge. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—Eldrin walks away with the key, accepting some wounds should bleed—with visible cost in his deliberate not-hearing of the lake's renewed hum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The carnivorous plant with "needle-teeth" and "maw" creates visceral constraint on Eldrin's choice, while the warm key burning against his thigh charges the final walking-away sequence. Setting details like "rotting blossoms" and "unnatural cold" support the dominant stake, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("tearing silk").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from finding a missing brother to confronting the lake's true nature as keeper rather than killer, with the seed's violent digestion forcing revelation. The cost manifests in Eldrin's physical collapse under truth's weight and his choice to walk away from further revelations, though the middle section could tighten between planting and confrontation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete tension between finding and leaving lost—the brother who "wished to stay hidden," the lake that keeps rather than takes, and Eldrin's final choice to let some wounds bleed. The warm key against cold snow creates a resonant final image of carried burden without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in details like "warm as a heartbeat" and "chips of the lake's own frozen core," with consistent POV filtering through Eldrin's finder-lens. Brief dialogue maintains subtext ("I didn't come for you," he lied), though some passages drift toward elevated register ("symmetric satisfaction").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the weight of knowing pressing him flatter than any blade could"), but parenthetical asides create momentum drag and some metaphors strain ("wound" lake, "hungry" roots). Template structures appear in the ending sequence ("Some things...Some things...") though they create intentional rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dark fantasy with psychological revelation—the lake as voluntary repository rather than predator transforms the missing-person trope. The warlock's failed trick being intended to force confession rather than freeze curse adds layered world-logic, though some elements feel familiar (carnivorous plant, mysterious key).</comment>
