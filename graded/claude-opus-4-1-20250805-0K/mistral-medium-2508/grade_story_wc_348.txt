<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied grief through concrete details (chrysalis against thigh, breath hitching) and contradictory impulses (building bridges that can't mend what matters). The final choice to wade deeper shows earned transformation through accumulated pressure, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("atonement wasn't a bridge, it was a dissolution").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Elias shifts from building to flowing, with visible cost in releasing the chrysalis. The ravine's divergent/convergent paths establish the governing metaphor early and pay off through his final wading in.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ravine functions as more than setting—its braided channels constrain and enable Elias's realization about separation/connection. Vivid sensory work (foam patterns, cold biting through boots) filtered through his polymer-chemist lens, though some descriptions lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: from identifying sister's body to placing chrysalis to wading deeper. The girl's appearance provides external pressure that crystallizes his stance, though the escalation relies more on internal realization than external complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the ravine's physical properties—separation/reconnection isn't stated but embodied in water's divergence and convergence. The final image of wading toward convergence offers a non-literal answer to loss without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of a polymer chemist (stress loads, bond angles, lattice structures) consistently filters observation. Some filter verbs ("he saw," "he thought") slightly dull immediacy, but voice remains coherent under emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("symphony of erosion," "Fibonacci unfurling"). Minor paraphrase loops around dissolution/letting go concepts, but momentum sustains through varied sentence structures.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-work through materials science perspective—polymer chains as metaphor for connection/dissolution. The biodegradable scaffold concept transforms familiar loss narrative, though some metaphors (composer/symphony) feel less integrated.</comment>
