<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora's skepticism drives genuine internal conflict between her disbelief in patience and her compulsion to act, with embodied tension ("fingers traced," "hands didn't waver"). The final choice to pull the memories free despite knowing "some locks needed breaking" carries visible cost through the city's transformation. Minor deduction for the younger-self voice appearing without sufficient setup, though the contradiction works thematically.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern accumulates (breadcrumbs, fractured light, memory threads) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where releasing memories transforms the city's fountains from rust to light. The closure lands with clear cost—"Some things, once unstuck, couldn't be contained"—and Liora's departure signals the irreversibility. Slight opacity around the mechanics of memory liberation prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The city of forgotten fountains constrains choices through its decayed infrastructure (rust-gurgling pumps, calcified wishes) and guides Liora via environmental breadcrumbs. The Bone Fountain's door "seamlessly fused into the stone" creates a physical obstacle requiring the glass box. The fountains' transformation to weeping light charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating pressure: following breadcrumbs → finding the sealed door → memories fighting back ("stretching like taffy") → the chamber trembling as threads snap. The dominant stake (liberating memories) faces genuine resistance with visible cost as "the city's fountains began to weep." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and liberation, with the glass box's "fractured light" mirroring broken memories. The final image of fountains weeping light rather than water offers a non-literal answer about transformation's cost. "Some things, once unstuck, couldn't be contained" resonates without moralizing, though the memory-as-imprisonment metaphor could push deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Liora's skeptical lens ("saw the glow of old lies but refused to call them truth") with consistent lyrical compression. The narrative voice maintains control through peak pressure, though some elevated diction ("sidereal patience") slightly strains the established register. Dialogue from the younger self feels abrupt without clearer distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variation and purposeful imagery ("V-formations dissolving into the horizon like a breath held too long"). Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("luminous skeptic" feels forced) and slight register drift in philosophical moments. The prose serves the accumulative design but occasionally reaches for effect over clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The memory-vault concept transforms the familiar trapped-memories trope through specific physical mechanics (glass box aligning with brass door cracks) and the city-scale consequence. The image of fountains weeping light instead of water offers genuine freshness. Slightly derivative in the quest-object framework but executes with sufficient particularity.</comment>
