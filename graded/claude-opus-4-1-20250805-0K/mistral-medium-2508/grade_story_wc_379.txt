<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to connect stories with healing is clear and embodied through concrete actions (handling the locket, opening the mailbox). The internal experience remains grounded in physical detail rather than abstract emotion. However, the final transformation to community healing happens too quickly without sufficient internal conflict or cost shown in Mira's choice to share Elena's letter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered discoveries (locket → mailbox → letter → community response). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the community begins writing their own letters, with visible emotional cost in Mrs. Delgado's trembling hands. The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical progression from discovery to community transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The courtyard setting actively constrains and enables choices—the rusted mailbox that "hasn't opened since '89" creates physical resistance, while the gathered neighbors provide immediate pressure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("jasmine and damp earth"). The locket's "tick-tick" and the mailbox's coldness in rising heat create tactile immediacy that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (proving listening heals through connecting lost stories) is signaled early and tightens when Mira must decide whether to open the private letter. The escalation follows the textural lens as discoveries accumulate pressure. Cost is visible in Mrs. Delgado's emotional response, though Mira's personal risk in choosing to share remains understated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—the locket holding "the sound of home" and the community's collective response to loss. The final image of neighbors writing letters offers a non-literal answer about how stories demand to be heard. Slight deduction for the line "we know she wanted to be heard" which edges toward explicit thematic statement rather than letting the action speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinct literary texture with controlled rhythm ("The courtyard held its breath") and selective perception focused on tactile details and sounds. The perceptual signature stays consistent even under emotional pressure. Brief dialogue serves its moments well with natural indirection ("That box hasn't opened since..."). No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose shows strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most lines advance story, atmosphere, and character simultaneously. Minor figurative excess appears ("like a slow exhale," "like a half-remembered secret," "like a misplaced note") but doesn't obscure clarity. The final image effectively recharges earlier motifs without loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The locked mailbox mystery offers a fresh angle on community healing through found objects. The specific detail of the 1989 storm and Elena Lopez creates authenticity. However, the transformation from individual discovery to collective healing follows a somewhat predictable arc. The risk-taking is modest—the story executes its premise competently without bold structural or perspectival choices.</comment>
