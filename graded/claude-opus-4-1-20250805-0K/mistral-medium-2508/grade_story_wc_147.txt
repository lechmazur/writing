<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's guilt-driven journey to harness the hush shows clear motivation with embodied details like "the taste of iron in her mouth as she clawed through the rubble." The internal contradiction between fleeing and confronting her guilt drives meaningful choices. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient transformation at closure where guilt dissolves too smoothly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the "gathered hush" achieving Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—Liora accepts living with loss rather than erasing it. Cost is visible in "the weight of what she'd lost" and her permanent inland exile. The perfume's transformation from violet-scented to clear water marks decisive change with clear before/after.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underwater temple setting actively constrains choices through oxygen limits and creates atmosphere with "bioluminescent jellyfish drifted like slow, indifferent stars." The mosaic floor's unnamed constellations and corroded metal plates enrich the world. Doesn't quite reach higher bands as the temple could be more specifically tied to the hush's properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from survival to moral reckoning as the signal dies and the hush gathers, forcing Liora's choice between erasure and acceptance. The oxygen countdown adds concrete pressure. Cost is legible in her permanent change and exile, though the middle section could tighten the pressure more explicitly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the perfume's transformation and the recurring jellyfish imagery, exploring memory's weight versus erasure. The final lines "Time...was something to hold, gently, like a vial of light—then let go" offer resonant non-literal answer to whether trauma should be escaped or integrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression like "the silence between echoes where time itself thinned like frayed silk." POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Some filter phrases like "she knew" and "she thought" slightly dull immediacy in places but don't harm closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery. Deductions for repetitive "She [verb]" constructions in the ending sequence and some paraphrase loops like "done answering"/"had harnessed." The filter-verb cluster in the final section ("she decided," "she thought") dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "gathered hush" as silence that rewrites memory offers a fresh angle on trauma and forgiveness. The underwater temple setting and perfume-as-memory device feel organic. Slight derivative elements in the diving accident backstory, but the execution transforms familiar material through specific detail.</comment>
