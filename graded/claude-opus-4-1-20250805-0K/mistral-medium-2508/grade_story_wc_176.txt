I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and symbolic actions toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elira transforms preservation from "holding tight" to "letting names change."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's internal journey from guilt to acceptance is embodied through concrete actions (unraveling/reconfiguring the rope, absorbing names into skin). The contradiction between preserving and releasing operates throughout, though some emotional transitions ("her heart light") lean toward telling rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where preservation transforms from static holding to dynamic transmission, with visible cost (years of regret, the dissolved card). However, the orientation remains somewhat abstract - we never learn specifics about Elira's world or the nature of "casters," creating comprehension friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sanctum setting actively shapes choices - the ice walls weep, the aurora responds to the rope's illumination, and the glacier's physical properties enable the ritual. Sensory details ("blue-dark," "breath crystallizing") are selective and purposeful, though some descriptions ("snowmelt ardor") prioritize lyricism over clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving lost names/language) coheres through Elira's ritual transformation, with escalation from whispers to chorus to bodily absorption. The cost registers emotionally but lacks concrete consequences - what exactly changes for Elira beyond internal acceptance remains vague.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of preservation-as-transformation, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of Elira as "the one who let the lost be found" resonates without stating its meaning directly, though the extended denouement slightly dilutes impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with selective perception ("fingers—still gentle despite decades of wax and flame"). Some passages achieve genuine beauty, but occasional overwriting ("snowmelt ardor given form") and abstract constructions weaken immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose varies between crystalline moments and overwritten passages. Mixed metaphors appear ("rope's strands were time itself" becomes "sleeping serpent"), and abstract language ("transcribed into the sanctum's bones") occasionally obscures concrete action. The extended ending creates momentum drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of preservation through transformation rather than stasis offers a fresh angle on memory and cultural loss. However, the execution relies on familiar fantasy elements (ancient sanctums, mystical auroras) without fully transforming them through specificity.</comment>
