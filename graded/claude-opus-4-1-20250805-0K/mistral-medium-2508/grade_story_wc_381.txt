<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation to "map the silence" and counter the prophecy is clear and embodied through concrete actions with the origami wing and water ritual. Her years-long pursuit shows consistent drive, and the final acceptance of partial success ("Just a sigh") represents earned endurance with visible cost. However, the internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—she moves linearly toward her goal without meaningful internal opposition pulling her elsewhere.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—the summoner accepts partial success ("not a scream, just a sigh") and finds peace with this incomplete victory, foreclosing her years of pursuit. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery intensifies (brook→origami→lattice→shattered surface) toward the crystallized moment of acceptance. Cost is visible in "her solitude pressing in like a second skin" and the years spent chasing echoes, though the exact stakes of the prophecy remain abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nocturnal brook setting constrains and enables the ritual—water serves as readable text, the origami wing requires moonlight to activate, and the reeds/moss provide physical grounding for the summoner's final rest. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("edges glowed faint with eerie light," "terrestrially cosmic tension"), creating atmosphere that mirrors internal state. The environment actively participates in the magic system and charges the final image of dawn dissolving into gold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preventing world's unraveling through silencing the prophecy) escalates through the ritual's progression: reading water→unfolding origami→catching escaped thread→accepting partial success. The "snap" moment provides reversal when the prophecy thread breaks free, forcing adaptation. However, the abstract nature of the threat ("weight of its own unspoken fears") and the lack of immediate consequences limit visceral pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "mapping silence" and finding peace in imperfection—the world saved not through elimination but softening ("edges of fear had been sanded down"). The origami wing's transformation and return carries thematic weight about accepting incomplete victories. The final image of the crane's shadow as "benediction" resonates without stating a moral, though some passages edge toward abstraction ("terrestrially cosmic," "half-remembered constellation").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("fingers tracing the water's surface as if reading a forgotten tongue"). The POV's mystical register fits the summoner's role, and psychic distance modulates effectively from close interiority to wider cosmic perspective. Some elevated diction ("terrestrially cosmic," "nocturnal haven") occasionally strains but serves the mythic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, ritual mechanics, or emotional state simultaneously. Minor redundancies appear ("The brook carried it away. The reeds bowed.") and some abstract phrases lack concrete grounding, but the closing sequence from "She closed her eyes" forward achieves exceptional cadence control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of achieving victory through "smoothing" rather than eliminating threat offers fresh perspective on the hero's journey. The origami wing as magical tool that "drinks" moonlight and reflections, then unfolds into a "lattice of light," demonstrates imaginative specificity. The resolution's acceptance of partial success ("Just a sigh") resists conventional triumph narratives while maintaining emotional truth.</comment>
