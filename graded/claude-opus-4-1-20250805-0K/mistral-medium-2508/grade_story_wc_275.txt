<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's internal conflict between leaving (father's voice) and staying (roses' need) creates genuine tension through embodied details like pressing thorns into palm and tasting salt/rust on sandbag fabric. The final choice to stay and "weave it back together" feels earned through her transformation from passive inheritor to active guardian, with visible cost in isolation amid chaos.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building density through rose-tending rituals toward Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora chooses to remain as keeper of quiet while the world burns—cost visible in her isolation. The pattern of father's phrases carved into tools/bark accumulates meaning, culminating in her decision to stitch the sandbag into the dome's seam as protective act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Glass dome constrains choice by creating binary inside/outside worlds—Liora must choose between them. Sensory hierarchy reflects her priorities: roses breathing, stems creaking, roots drinking versus external chaos felt only as vibrations through glass. The fissured pane becomes deadline pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating pressures: tower's fall, father's voice commanding departure, dome's cracked pane threatening breach, culminating in Liora's stance crystallization to stay and tend. Cost legible in accepting isolation: "Neither did she" spread.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: roses that "didn't know" the tower fell embody preserved innocence worth protecting. The ending image of weaving "one thorn at a time" offers non-literal answer about continuity through patient tending rather than fleeing, with Liora accepting the cost of isolation to preserve what matters.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Liora notices plant details (roses breathing, stems creaking) over human chaos. Some register elevation in phrases like "inculcating the roots" and occasional filter-verb clusters ("She pressed," "She traced") that slightly dull immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments of compression ("The tower was dust. The roses were not.") but filter-verb stacks appear in pressure beats ("She pressed," "She traced," "She tore"). Template cadence runs in middle sections with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions across 4-5 consecutive sentences diminish momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with contemplative garden-tending creates unexpected juxtaposition. The specific detail of father as bounty-hunter-turned-rose-whisperer who taught plants to "listen" transforms familiar collapse narrative through intimate scale and inverted violence (knife sharpened only to carve words).</comment>
