I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural** lens, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern-work toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's motivation crystallizes through embodied patience—her curved spine, cracked fingers, and methodical layering reveal character through physical detail. The final choice to continue working "in the spaces between breaths" shows earned endurance with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("patience as endless as the dark") that briefly pulls from concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the alchemist's understanding shifts from "preserving light" to "teaching it how to stay"—a conceptual repricing with clear cost in her isolation and endless labor. The accumulative structure coheres through pattern-work building to this revelation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The subarctic crater setting actively constrains choice—the cold cracks her fingers, the silence enables her work, the withered orchard provides materials (apple husks, ice shards). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "frost on iron," "thin as dragonfly wings." The orchard's transformation from green memory to white snow charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation reads as density increase and pattern deepening appropriate to the textural lens—from arranging materials to binding starlight to understanding her true purpose. The cost is legible in her physical deterioration and chosen isolation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the seal succeeds and she grasps her role as teacher rather than preserver.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of "teaching light how to stay"—a non-literal answer to preservation that reweights all prior pattern-making. The recurring star image transforms from unreachable goal to patient student. Subtext operates through the quiet acceptance of endless work while others find her maps "someday."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through craft metaphors—heartbeats as maps, starlight with taste, patience settling into bones. Voice maintains lyric control even under the pressure of the binding ritual. Minor filter-verb clustering ("she liked to think") creates slight distance but serves the meditative tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs—"her breath curling like smoke" establishes cold, life, and fragility simultaneously. Some metaphor density in peak moments ("patience as endless as the dark") approaches overwriting but coheres with the lyric mode. Clean prose mechanics with purposeful fragment use that serves rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy-as-teaching and starlight-as-student offers a fresh angle on preservation stories. The specific detail of flash-paper craft and the subarctic crater setting avoid generic post-apocalyptic templates. Risk-taking in the quiet, meditative approach to world-ending pays off through earned resonance.</comment>
