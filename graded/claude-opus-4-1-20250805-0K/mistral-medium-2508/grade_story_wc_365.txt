I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through pattern, resonance, and density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora becomes "the map" itself.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's sensory mapping ability and internal conflict between resisting/following the pull create genuine tension. The "weight in her chest wasn't fear" crystallizes her values with earned cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("weight of meaning") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Liora becomes the map) with clear cost—abandoning the known world. The accumulative pattern of shards/seams/weights builds coherently. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (spaceport context emerges gradually) and some opacity around the man's identity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The repair bay's "rusted girders groaning like bones" and sensory details (ozone, old grease) create atmosphere while the shard/seam constrains choices. The environment actively shapes Liora's navigation. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors ("sickly glow").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from finding the shard to the seam closing/reopening to final choice. The "weight" accumulates meaning across beats—grams→meaning→promise→fear/thrill. Cost is visible when she steps through, leaving the known world behind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the weaving metaphor and truth-as-choice concept without exposition. The final "She was the map now" resonantly answers the opening's sensory mapping. Strong subtext in "Some doors only open when you stop looking."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Liora's sensory mapping POV. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("You weren't supposed to find that"). Deduction for occasional register elevation ("cyclically spontaneous") and some filter-verb clustering in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("weight of meaning"), some synonym repetition (shard/fragment/glass), and occasional overwriting ("ghost of machinery"). The paraphrase loop "She was the map now / And the map was endless" weakens momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of parallel universe navigation through sensory mapping. The concept of truth as "weaving" and doors that "only open when you stop looking" offers non-obvious angles. Risk-taking in the elliptical structure pays off.</comment>
