<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lior's internal contradiction between isolation and his role as sanctuary keeper creates genuine tension, with embodied details like "fingers tracing the doorknocker ring—a tarnished bronze coil, cold as the silence." The shadow's arrival forces a choice between letting go and holding on, earning the final renunciation through prior causality of his deliberate bridge-burning.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Lior steps through the newly-appeared door, with visible cost in abandoning the sanctuary lineage. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and shadow encroachment build pressure toward the crystallized choice. Who/where/when anchored early ("ashen sanctuary," "Lior," inherited space).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sanctuary functions as constraining micro-setting with "walls blackened by centuries of whispered confessions" and "starlight through the cracked dome." Environmental details like the fading threshold and materializing door directly shape Lior's final choice, though some descriptions lean toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure escalates from ember's dying pulse through shadow's encroachment to the threshold offer, with Lior's agency in turning the ring releasing all shadows. The dominant stake—whether to maintain isolation or release the accumulated weight—tightens as the sanctuary itself begins fading, forcing action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: burned bridges as self-imposed prison, the sanctuary as both refuge and trap. The final line "Some were meant to be burned so thoroughly, the smoke taught you how to breathe" resonantly reweights the suffocation motif without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("The dead didn't encroach all at once"). Some register elevation in phrases like "loaded emptiness" and "the way roots split stone" occasionally strains against the intimate POV, but psychic distance modulates effectively with emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. However, some overwriting appears ("the kind that clung to skin long after the ritual ended") and occasional template patterns emerge ("Lior didn't move" / "Lior exhaled" / "Lior reached"). The metaphorical density in places like "bridges burned" risks cliché.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The sanctuary as liminal space between isolation and connection offers a fresh angle on the haunted-place trope. The specific detail of being a "tender shadow keeper" who paradoxically cuts everyone off creates originality, though some elements (burned bridges metaphor, ghostly visitation) feel familiar.</comment>
