<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lior's internal conflict between understanding and surrendering to the path's choice creates genuine tension, with embodied reactions (breath fogging glass, shaking hands) and the final acceptance earning its cost through prior setup. The wafer seal's physical heat and the visceral response to seeing alternate selves ground the character's progression convincingly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring path/choice imagery that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lior accepts being chosen rather than choosing. The cost is legible in the dissolution of the bunker and the ash transformation of the wafer seal—tangible losses that enable the new stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bunker's transformation from refuge to test site and its final dissolution into forest constrains Lior's choices throughout. Vivid sensory work ("damp earth and something older—ozone") and the peeling murals that shift from blurred to clear create a setting that actively participates in the narrative arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking shelter to confronting identity across timelines, with the terminal's directives forcing increasingly difficult recognitions. The final negotiation between Lior and the path ("a dance, a negotiation") demonstrates agency through acceptance rather than action, with clear cost in surrendering certainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The central theme of agency versus determinism emerges through concrete imagery (paths choosing walkers, vines pulling dream-Lior) rather than exposition. The final image of Lior running through rather than away, laughing as the forest swallows her, offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire question of choice versus fate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through Lior's specific consciousness ("the kind her grandmother had warned her about in riddles"), with controlled psychic distance that tightens during peak moments. The italicized other-Lior dialogue and terminal messages create textural variety without breaking POV consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and varied syntax, though some metaphorical density in early paragraphs ("swallowing its own echoes," "ghost of machine oil") slightly slows momentum. The final sequence accelerates cleanly with shorter, more direct sentences that match the urgency of transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of paths as sentient choosers rather than passive options offers a fresh angle on the choice/fate dichotomy. The specific synthesis of bunker-as-test-site with time-storm and film-showing-alternate-selves creates an inevitable-feeling payoff, though the grandmother's riddle setup feels slightly familiar.</comment>
