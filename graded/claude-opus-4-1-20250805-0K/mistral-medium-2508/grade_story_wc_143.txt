<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation crystallizes through embodied details—the grain of sand as temporal anchor, his methodical documentation against erasure. His choice to plant the canister shows agency under pressure, though the internal conflict could sharpen further. The final acceptance ("that had to be enough") lands as earned resignation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with the three-pulse canister creating temporal markers against the mining countdown. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's departure carrying his private archive while the crater awaits destruction—cost is palpable in "what it had lost." The sand grain's transformation from timekeeper to witness deepens the stakes effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tycho Crater's summit becomes more than backdrop—the "silvered dust" and "jagged rock" provide tactile anchors while Earth hanging "like a pale jewel" charges the photography. The canister's green shimmer against black void creates visual drama. The landing pad and ship's "hull already gilded" mark spatial transitions cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Escalation builds through the three-hour countdown and the canister's timed pulses marking inevitability. The dominant stake—preserving beauty before erasure—tightens as "the drones' distant hum vibrated through the dust." Cost registers in Elias's final photograph capturing "his own shadow stretching toward home," though the conflict could press harder.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the sand grain's evolution from measuring scientific time to marking endings. The photographs as theft/defiance and the canister's message "I was here. I saw" avoid abstraction. The final image—Earth rising with Elias's shadow—offers resonant answer to preservation versus progress without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "kicking up ghosts of light" and the camera's "hungry" lens. Voice modulates effectively from lyrical observation to terse action ("He snapped the shot. Then another."). The controlled rhythm in "But nights did end. And so did craters" heightens impact without sacrificing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the universe clearing its throat." Some repetitive structures appear ("Elias knelt," "Elias smiled," "Elias exhaled") and occasional overwriting ("swollen with unspoken promises"). The final image achieves high density with multiple layers of meaning compressed effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bioluminescent time-marking system offers fresh angle on preservation theme. The sand grain's recontextualization from hourglass to lunar witness shows ingenuity. While the lone-observer-before-destruction frame is familiar, specific details like the chemical cocktail's precise intervals elevate execution.</comment>
