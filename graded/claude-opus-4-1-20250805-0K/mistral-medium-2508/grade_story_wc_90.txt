<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lien's motivation to mend the dimensional tear is clear and consistent, driven by three hundred years of solitary purpose. Her embodied responses—body becoming "lighter" with grief lifting, trembling fingers at breakthrough—ground the emotional arc. The final choice to step through carries genuine cost (unraveling behind her), though internal contradiction could be sharper during the pivotal push.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lien crosses into the green world, leaving the Eulogy behind. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through stitching attempts, with the photograph warming and the tear widening until breakthrough. Cost is visible—the ship of bones dissolves, the old dimension seals shut. Minor orientation wobble around "locked dimension" mechanics early on.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Eulogy as "ship of bones" creates immediate atmospheric pressure, while the needle of "black glass, honed from the edge of a collapsed star" adds mythic specificity. The green grass at closure provides stark sensory contrast to the bone-ship's decay. Setting constrains choice through the ship's failing gravity and recycled hull, though mid-story spatial choreography occasionally blurs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through three stitching attempts: thread snaps, then holds, then opens the tear fully. Each failure adds pressure—the photograph warms, gravity flickers more violently, the AI activates with urgency. The child's impossible laugh and reaching hands raise emotional stakes perfectly. Cost is legible in Lien's unraveling and the Eulogy's dissolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the act of mending what's "broken beyond use"—shadow work as necessary grief-labor. The final image of green grass where "sorrow had been" delivers resonant transformation without stating a moral. Kwan Yin's compassion-as-code and the tear as "absence where sorrow should have been" create layered meaning about loss and connection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice combines technical precision ("Subject 47-X. Terminated at 3 minutes") with lyrical compression ("The thread was her own breath, spun thin"). POV remains stable with Lien throughout. The child's single line of dialogue "Look" carries appropriate simplicity, though some filter constructions ("She could see hands reaching through") slightly dull immediacy in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong opening "ship of bones—human bones" and closing "She stayed" create propulsive frame. Information density high throughout, with lines doing multiple jobs. Some template cadence in middle sections ("She [verb]. The [noun] [verb].") and occasional paraphrase loops ("She began to stitch" follows closely after describing her stitching). Figurative language mostly lands, though "ladder of light" feels slightly stock.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of generation ship and dimensional portal tropes through the specific image of stitching reality with breath-as-thread. The Eulogy built from human bones and "last prayers" offers haunting originality. Risk-taking in the lyrical compression and mythic register pays off, though the green world resolution edges toward familiar territory.</comment>
