<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with Elias's physical engagement with the lattice and lighthouse, contradictory impulses between fear and determination shown through action. The transformation from inheriting his father's legacy of lies to speaking truth lands with visible cost—the disbelief he'll face. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("burned like a secret") rather than full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Decisive Change occurs when Elias retrieves his father's name and speaks truth for the first time, with the cost being perpetual disbelief. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of imagery and pattern-breaking at closure. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Deduction for slightly abstract cost presentation—the price of disbelief could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-prison with its copperlight beam constrains choices throughout—Elias must climb the lattice, navigate the spiral glass, work before bodies are found. The reef as teeth, the scuffed door, and the lattice's transformation all pressure action. Setting actively shapes the closure when the beam flickers blue, signaling change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of changing the beginning/breaking the cycle escalates through Elias's ascent, the lattice's unfolding, and the race against discovery. The hush moment crystallizes options effectively. Cost is present but somewhat oblique—the burden of truth-telling in a world of disbelief could be more immediately felt in the final beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the inherited burden of lies versus truth, with the lattice as confessional wood carrying others' sins. The final image of Elias grinning with "copperlight in his teeth" while offering to tell the whispers' stories resonates strongly. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit framing of "changing the beginning" rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with inventive metaphors ("rusted needle in the throat of the sea"), controlled rhythm that modulates with tension. The whispers' dialogue carries authentic otherness. Strong perceptual signature in how Elias experiences the lighthouse's copperlight and the lattice's warmth. Clean POV control throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"the lighthouse stood like a rusted needle" establishes setting, tone, and threat simultaneously. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful fragments. Minor repetition of "copperlight" works as pattern. Slight deduction for occasional abstraction ("hungrier affinity") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of confession, inherited sin, and lighthouse-as-prison creates original mythology. The lattice that unfolds into names, the specific detail of "the boy who cried wolf's son," and the transformation of lies into truth through physical retrieval all feel inevitable yet surprising. Risk-taking in the lyrical density pays off (+0.3).</comment>
