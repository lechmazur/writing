I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds meaning through layered imagery, metaphor, and pattern rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chronicler's motivation emerges through embodied details—fingers tracing stone, the cicada's warmth, her tangential observation methods—rather than declaration. The fisherman's grief creates genuine pressure that forces her gift of the cicada, a meaningful micro-choice with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("the truth was too vast") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the chronicler's gift of the cicada and her understanding that "transitions were never truly over, only layered." The cost is visible in her relinquishing the grandmother's heirloom and the fisherman's future grief softening "like a stone worn by the tide." The accumulative lens holds throughout, though the temporal jump to "years later" slightly weakens immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The grotto functions as more than setting—its dripping water, moonlight pooling "like spilled ink," and whispering walls actively shape the chronicler's perception and enable her insight. The tidal pools mirror human transitions throughout. The jade cicada's physical properties (cool, then warm, finally weeping) constrain and enable key choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through textural deepening: the fisherman's unspoken grief, the cicada's warming potential, the water drop creating ripples that "expand, then fade." The dominant stake—understanding transitions and grief—tightens when she sees "the shape of it, the way a shell holds the memory." Cost is legible in the relinquished heirloom and the fisherman's altered future.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of tidal pools and transitions, avoiding direct statement. The hermit crab's new shell "smooth and unbroken, but for a single hairline crack" resonates without explaining. The final image of the cicada weeping in the dark and textures "meant to linger" offers a non-literal answer about grief's persistence and transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout—the chronicler notices through marine metaphors ("like a crab sidles toward its prey"), tangential observation, and textural detail. Prose rhythm modulates effectively, particularly in the grotto sequence. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("metallic tang," "tangential approach") that slightly exceeds the naturalistic frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong moments of compression and imagery, particularly "moonlight pooled like spilled ink" and the water drop "like a pinprick through fabric." However, several abstract passages dilute momentum: "the truth was too vast for the shape of his question," "transitions were never truly over, only layered." Some filter constructions ("she knew," "she understood") reduce immediacy in key beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The integration of marine biology observation with human grief offers a fresh angle on loss. The jade cicada as a listening device for transitions and the chronicler's tangential observation method create specificity. The final image of the cicada weeping transforms the expected arc, though the grief-as-tide metaphor itself is somewhat familiar.</comment>
