Looking at this story through the lens of a demanding editor, I'll evaluate each category with precision.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's transformation from extraction to offering is earned through concrete particulars—the shell's warmth, Liora's grip, the jump—with contradictory impulses (capturing vs. returning) acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to "pull her into the next equation" carries visible cost in their physical fall and emotional vulnerability. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("density of presence") that occasionally drifts from embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the shell's transformation from vessel to key to promise, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the jump literalizes their philosophical shift. Cost is felt in "The fall was weightless. The landing was not." and the physical/emotional vulnerability of their shared descent. Orientation anchors (ember nexus, twilight, Elias as alchemist) establish by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ember nexus functions as more than backdrop—its "veins of molten copper" and "hidden furnaces" constrain the alchemical world while the shell's physical properties (warmth, spiral, equations) enable the final transformation. The jump through the cityscape charges the ending with spatial consequence. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (the city's "pulse," the shell's "hum").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing vs. offering presence) deepens through Liora's challenge "You've been measuring the wrong thing," forcing Elias to revalue his entire practice. The jump forecloses his old extraction method with physical risk ("The landing was not [weightless]"). Agency drives the resolution but the middle lacks a sharper tightening moment before the philosophical shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shell's evolution and the extraction/offering dialectic without explicit moralizing. The final image of walking "inside" the experiment rather than toward it offers a non-literal answer to the central question of presence. "The secret wasn't in the whisper. It was in the echo" resonates without explaining, reweighting all prior alchemical attempts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through alchemical metaphors ("pocket-suns," "bottle the weight of a moment") and scientific-romantic fusion in observations. Dialogue carries subtext effectively (Liora's "Took you long enough" compresses years of waiting). Some register elevation in peak moments ("the juice the density of all the things they'd ever meant to say") strains against established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density generally high with lines doing multiple jobs, but figurative density in high-pressure beats occasionally obscures ("splitting open like a fruit, its juice the density"). Template cadence appears in final section ("The shell had done its work. Now it was theirs to do the rest."). Some paraphrase loops around the extraction/offering concept reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The alchemical framework freshly explores presence through physical transformation of light and equations that are "felt" rather than solved. The jump "through" rather than down offers a non-obvious spatial metaphor for their philosophical shift. Risk-taking in the lyrical density serves the accumulative design though occasionally tips toward opacity.</comment>
