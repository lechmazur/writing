<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Li Wei's internal contradiction between his role as oracle and his homesickness drives credible micro-choices, particularly his decision to finally "conduct" rather than merely write. The character's embodied emotions through specific memories (mother's sewing machine, father's fishing boat) avoid therapy-speak, though the final conducting gesture risks slight abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Li Wei's shift from passive fortune-writer to active conductor, with visible emotional cost tied to his displacement and family losses. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and memories build toward the final crystallized moment, though the conducting metaphor's exact mechanics remain slightly oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The glass spire and frozen lake create genuine spatial pressure that shapes Li Wei's isolation and amplifies his every sound. The nautilus shell functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (he must "hold" rather than "hear"), directly charging the final image where he shapes air between spire and sky.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure builds through accumulation of sensory and memorial weight rather than external conflict, culminating in Li Wei's choice to "conduct" despite the waiting courier. The cost is legible in his acceptance of homesickness as temporal rather than spatial ("not a place but a *when*"), though agency could be more forcefully dramatized in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete paradox of creating futures while being trapped in the past, with the nautilus shell's dual nature (hearing vs. holding) providing non-literal resonance. The final conducting gesture offers a complex answer about creation from loss without moralizing, though it edges toward slight abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Li Wei's synesthetic awareness ("air tasted of ice and old electricity") and his tendency to map time through sensory memory. The prose rhythm successfully modulates with emotional intensity, particularly in the fragmentary memories, maintaining coherent POV throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs (e.g., "the frozen lake stretched like a cracked mirror, its surface splitting the dawn into jagged reflections—a horizon that refused to stay still"). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though occasional elevated diction ("treble clef," "overture") slightly strains the register in peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The fortune-writer-as-conductor synthesis feels earned through specific details like arranging cats by meow-pitch, avoiding template mysticism. The homesickness-as-temporal concept offers genuine freshness, though the conducting metaphor at closure, while poetic, doesn't fully transform the familiar artist-in-exile framework.</comment>
