<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's thirty-year burden and the puppet head's arrival create clear motivation for his final choice to release the stolen moments. The cost—his own erasure from the tapestry—is explicit and felt. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("nested patterns," "vouchsafe") that briefly distances from embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the puppet head triggering Elias's decisive action to unspool time's stolen moments, accepting his own dissolution. The closure lands with visible cost ("Elias stayed until the stars remembered how to blink") and resonant reconfiguration. Slight opacity around "nested patterns" mechanics prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse as "membrane where time's final ripple thinned" and the clock's amber glow create atmospheric pressure that shapes Elias's choice. The puppet head's porcelain materiality and "glass eye clouded as if weeping" grounds the fantastical. Setting constrains action through the clock's physical mechanism requiring the puppet head as key.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from clock maintenance to releasing all stolen time, with Elias's thread as explicit price. The puppet head's lullaby creates the turning point that forces his choice between continuing his role or releasing the trapped moments. Cost is legible: "no more adjustments, no more stuttering hands, just the final chime."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lullaby bridges personal memory and universal consolation, with the puppet head as "seam where pressure had finally split." The ending's child humming "a tune they'd never been taught" offers resonant answer to time's burden without stating a moral. Theme emerges through the paradox of holding versus releasing time.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("where time frayed," "salt-spit of waves"). POV remains stable with Elias's perception filtering the fantastical elements. Some elevated diction ("vouchsafe," "nested patterns") occasionally drifts from established register, preventing higher score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong imagery and varied syntax, but "nested patterns" appears twice without clear definition, creating mild opacity. Some abstract phrasing ("membrane where time's final ripple thinned") risks comprehension. The closing sequence from "The lighthouse kept its secret" forward achieves excellent rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper and temporal guardian with the puppet head as unexpected catalyst. The concept of time as something that can be "held" in amber-like compression, released through a lullaby, shows genuine originality. The image of a child humming an untaught tune resonates beyond genre expectations.</comment>
