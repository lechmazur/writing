<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's transformation from performance-driven scientist to patient observer is earned through concrete details (butterfly dust, mapping decay patterns), with his final choice to take sabbatical carrying clear professional cost. The internal contradiction between his neutron star expertise and greenhouse attachment creates authentic tension, though some emotional transitions feel slightly accelerated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through dust applications, pattern recognition, and the shift from "making things matter" to "watching things fall apart," culminating in Earned Stasis where Elias accepts decay with visible cost (abandoning career trajectory). The closure lands with "The Theory of Kindled Humility" as both conceptual repricing and character transformation, though the email exchange feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse's transformation from "cathedral of glass and steam" to "jagged panes...like broken teeth" constrains Elias's choices throughout, with wet soil, shattered glass, and flood wreckage creating tactile presence. The butterfly dust's iridescent properties and soil patterns provide specific sensory detail, though the lab and department settings remain somewhat generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure builds through accumulation: daily dust applications, colleague dismissal, dwindling vial contents, leading to Elias's recognition that forces his sabbatical choice. The stake—choosing between forcing outcomes versus witnessing decay—deepens when he feels "something shift beneath the dust," though the middle section could tighten its repetitive observations.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically through the butterfly dust revealing "the shape of absence" and patterns in decay, culminating in "even in decay, there was a kind of creation." The neutron star parallel enriches without over-explaining, and the final image of math feeling "soft...Like butterfly wings" offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question of how to respond to loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature emerges through scientific precision ("iridescent dust," "spiral arms," "neutron star's crust") mixed with poetic observation. The prose modulates effectively from clinical observation to emotional recognition, though the philosophical register in places ("poetry of decay," "kindled humility") slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("clawed its ribs bare," "blackened stems, petals dissolved into pulp"), but suffers from repetitive structures ("He wasn't planting. He was mapping") and some overwriting in metaphorical density. The final section contains mild template cadence ("Like butterfly wings. Like the first breath. Like the beginning") that dulls impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics and horticulture creates non-obvious angle on grief and acceptance, with butterfly dust as unexpected bridge between scales. The concept of studying decay rather than forcing growth offers genuine insight, though the "Theory of Kindled Humility" naming feels slightly forced.</comment>
