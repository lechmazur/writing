<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aldric's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (trembling fingers, pressing ear to egg), with internal conflict between desperate hope and "quaking certainty" of failure. The final choice to embrace the "broken miracle" shows earned acceptance of imperfection with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("bitter-sweet ache of living") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (egg cracking, creature emerging) that reweight the dominant stake of reviving beauty. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when prince and creature hang "not in defeat, but in the quaking reverie of a world learning to breathe again" - cost is visible in the "broken miracle" and acceptance of ugliness. Orientation anchors (prince, palace, egg) established early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The suspended palace setting directly constrains choices through "failing lungs," groaning chains, and spatial limitations that force the prince's desperate experiment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt-stiff robes, rust taste, mineral tears). The stalactite world and mechanical infrastructure shape both the problem and the flawed solution, charging the final image of suspension between abyss and ceiling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawakening beauty) signaled early and tightens through the egg's transformation from potential to "flawed genesis." The creature's emergence escalates pressure as it becomes clear success means accepting imperfection rather than recovering lost perfection. Cost is legible in the "ugly trying to become beautiful" and the prince's laughter/weeping convergence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of the egg into glass-winged creature, avoiding abstraction until earned. The final image offers a resonant answer: beauty requires accepting flaws and "the bitter aftertaste of hope." Strong subtext in the mother's hidden egg and the distinction between "madness" and "hypothesizing."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through selective attention to decay and mechanical failure, with controlled modulation during the hatching sequence. Some elevated diction ("quaking reverie," "sacrament") fits the fairy-tale register but occasionally strains. No dialogue to evaluate. Voice maintains consistency through emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("bitter-sweet ache of living," "numb efficiency") and some repetitive structures ("It was not...It was something new"). Information density is high in descriptive passages but occasionally loops conceptually (beauty/ugliness dichotomy restated). No major artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk and fairy tale through specific details (chains of black iron, hollow bird bones, glass wings). The transformation of sky-singer into mechanical-organic hybrid offers non-obvious angle on rebirth myths. Risk-taking in the ambiguous creature design and acceptance of failure as success heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
