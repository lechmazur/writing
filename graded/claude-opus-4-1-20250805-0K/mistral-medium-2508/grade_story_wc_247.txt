<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction between Elias's urgent signing and Liora's measured disruption creates genuine tension. The characters' responses to the faceless entity—Liora lunging forward with the camera, Elias signing a storm—reveal values through action under extreme pressure. Minor deduction for slight emotional abstraction ("quiet charisma wrapping around them like a cloak") in non-peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration: the harbor transforms from empty silence to "alive" silence "humming just beneath the threshold of hearing." Cost is legible in "heavier now, like a heart full of names" and the transformation of forgotten songs into recovered memory. The faceless entity's dissolution and the waves' color-chord response create decisive change with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The harbor setting actively constrains and enables: water becomes the medium for the entity's appearance, waves respond with color-chords, moonlight fractures into "trembling notes." Sensory hierarchy privileges sound-as-silence and light-as-disruption through Elias's signing and Liora's camera work. The vintage camera functions as micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation: signing faster → shadow appears → camera truly flashes → waves rise in color-chords. The dominant stake (recovering erased memory) tightens when the faceless entity manifests as active opposition. Cost appears in Liora's shaking hands and the camera's changed weight, though the resolution feels slightly swift for the threat level introduced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: memory as resistance, silence as both loss and potential. The final image of "forgotten began to sing" and "the world felt wide enough to hold them" offers resonant answer without stating moral. Subtext operates beautifully through the empty camera capturing essence, though "stealing back what time had erased" edges toward slight thematic directness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature: "signs for sounds that had no voice," "thread of smoke in the damp air." Lyric compression serves the accumulative mode well, with taught patterns like italicized phrases marking different registers of meaning. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("Light doesn't need film to be real"). Minor friction in occasional elevated diction ("silvered moon") that doesn't fully integrate with character perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "waves lapping at the docks like a lullaby no one remembered how to sing" establishes setting, loss, and tone simultaneously. Some figurative density in peak moments ("blade wrapped in velvet," "heart full of names") creates slight coherence friction. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph breaks maintain momentum throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-recovery through sign language and empty photography creates non-obvious angle. The faceless entity with only a mouth—singing "hunger" rather than sound—transforms expected antagonist tropes. Risk-taking in the lyric mode and color-as-chord synesthesia heightens stakes, though some metaphors ("blade wrapped in velvet") feel less integrated.</comment>
