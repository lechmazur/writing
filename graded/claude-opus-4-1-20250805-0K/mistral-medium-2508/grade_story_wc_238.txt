<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's guilt and need for reconciliation drive genuine internal conflict, with the perfume bottle's "current" metaphor embodying her complex stance on apology—requiring mutual participation rather than one-sided absolution. The final choice to "plant something new" shows earned transformation through prior causality with visible cost (the orchard's loss). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("gossip-column exorcist") that lacks immediate grounding, though the emotional architecture remains sound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the perfume's magic as connective tissue building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where both characters accept loss while choosing renewal. The closure lands with felt cost—the orchard falls but earth "remembers the current"—creating a legitimate before/after through accumulated metaphorical weight. Slight opacity in the magic system's mechanics ("tendrils threading through walls") doesn't break causality but prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive's sensory palette (yellowed paper, old roses) and the orchard under threat create atmospheric pressure that shapes the reconciliation's urgency. The perfume's transformation from floral to "sharp, green tang of sap" mirrors the shift from past hurt to future growth. The setting constrains choice through the dawn deadline, though some spatial choreography remains vague ("back room" positioning).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconciliation before irreversible loss—tightens through the perfume's painful magic that "dragged up the weight of every unsent letter." The orchard's impending destruction creates genuine urgency, and Mara's choice to stay and "plant something new" shows agency with cost. However, the magical escalation feels somewhat predetermined rather than arising from character decisions, limiting higher scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The current metaphor elegantly develops from magical perfume to reconciliation philosophy to the earth's memory, with the final image of saplings growing fast providing non-literal resolution to the forgiveness question. "Some miracles don't need to be perfect. They just need to be true" crystallizes theme through earned particulars. The complexity of mutual culpability and imperfect healing resists tidy moral resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice balances lyrical description ("liquid twilight") with sharp dialogue ("Words are easy. This?"), maintaining consistency through emotional intensification. POV control remains stable with Mara's perspective filtering the magical and emotional elements. Minor convergence in dialogue rhythm during peak emotional moments ("It hurts." / "Good.") prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful metaphorical density that serves the accumulative structure. Information density is high—most sentences advance both literal and thematic layers. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("gossip-column exorcist") lacking immediate clarity and some repetitive stems in the emotional peak section ("Elias..." constructions), though overall momentum remains strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "gossip-column exorcist" concept offers fresh specificity, and the perfume-as-apology-current provides non-obvious synthesis of magic and reconciliation. The mutual culpability (Mara's reckless accusation, Elias's secretive good intentions) avoids simple moral positions. While execution is strong, the reconciliation arc follows somewhat predictable emotional beats once the premise is established.</comment>
