<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's twenty years of silent service and numb arm create clear motivation for his choice to listen rather than maintain silence. The pianist's sewn lips and burned face embody the cost of the unpardonable silence viscerally. Internal contradiction between duty and recognition drives the decisive final choice, though some emotional transitions could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elias's choice to stay and listen, with the fortress "answering" as visible cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details (bolt warming, note in molars, snow falling like broken scales) build toward the crystallized moment where "remaining was its own kind of sound." Causality is clear: bolt discovery → following traces → finding pianist → understanding → choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress's needle-thin turrets and humming quiet establish atmosphere immediately. The bolt constrains choice by being the "key to rebuilding" the piano. Sensory hierarchy works well—the note thrumming in molars, the wax "seraphically mundane in its imperfection"—though some descriptions lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from discovery (bolt) through recognition (pianist) to understanding (cost of silence) to choice (giving bolt/staying). The teacup shattering and woman's scream dying before reaching stairs show immediate consequences. Cost is legible in the pianist's sewn lips and Elias's returning pain "like distant music."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete revelation that "the cost of safety had never been silence. It had been the choice to stay silent." The final image of the fortress answering offers a non-literal resolution. The "unpardonable silence" that unravels sound itself gains complexity through the pianist's return and Elias's choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent limited third with selective perception—Elias notices the bolt's "brass head dulled by something darker than tarnish." Brief dialogue is sparse but effective ("You're not supposed to be here"). Some filter verbs in emotional beats slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong moments like "seraphically mundane in its imperfection" and "the color of a bruise just before it fades" show control. However, abstract phrases like "the effort of remaining" and "a tuneless, frostbitten hope of a sound" lean toward ornamental. Some paraphrase loops around silence/sound concepts in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "unpardonable silence" as a sequence that unravels sound itself is fresh. The image of lips sewn shut with black thread is viscerally original. The synthesis of nerve regeneration with returning ability to feel/hear pain as music shows ingenuity, though some metaphysical concepts remain abstract.</comment>
