<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal contradiction between destroying and preserving drives genuine complexity, with his final choice to burn again carrying visible cost ("volcanic tenderness erupting"). The self-vandalism-as-map revelation earns its weight through prior setup. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("the weight of unspoken vows") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change: Elias burns the final archive after understanding his true motivation, with cost visible in "pockets empty, his hands unmarked by soot for the first time." The causal chain from discovery to understanding to final action holds. The promise/fire revelation lands with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archive setting constrains choices (the key, the pillar, the hidden book) and the desert provides the final erasure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("charred parchment and old regret"). The tapestry fragment and pillar carvings function as micro-settings that enable discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from archaeological discovery through self-recognition to the final burning decision. The revelation that "the promise was the fire" effectively reweights all prior destruction. Cost is visible in letting go of both the archive and the unnamed archivist's memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of preservation through destruction without explicit moralizing. The final image of smoke "curling into the shape of a question no one would ever ask" offers resonant ambiguity. "Some promises were meant to burn" crystallizes the thematic question without preaching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled elevated register fits the archaeological/archival setting. Some overwriting ("volcanic tenderness," "the archive would burn clean this time") slightly dulls impact. POV remains stable and the perceptual signature of noticing texts and symbols is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose occasionally strains with elevated diction ("volcanic tenderness erupting in his chest") and some abstract phrasing. Information density is generally strong but phrases like "the weight of unspoken vows" and "another ghost the desert wouldn't remember" tend toward the ornamental. Line-level craft supports the story without major impediment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait as map inverts expectations effectively. The concept of burning libraries to save rather than destroy knowledge offers a fresh angle. Some elements feel derivative (desert archive, mysterious key) but the execution transforms them through specific detail.</comment>
