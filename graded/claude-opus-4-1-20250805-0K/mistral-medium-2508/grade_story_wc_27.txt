I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena's "awkward confidence" manifests through concrete embodied actions (barefoot navigation, pressing palm to stones) and her internal contradiction between desperation and certainty drives the discovery. The transformation from solitary seeker to catalyst feels earned through specific gestures, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("desperate for it to be the former").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the stones' awakening reweights the rebellion's meaning from "stalled" to "listening." Cost is legible in "wreckage," "scars," and the implied risk of reignition. The pattern of hum→roar→collective awakening builds coherently, though the transition from individual discovery to collective action could be tighter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned bay's physicality (rusted girders, cracked concrete, skeletal engines) constrains movement and discovery effectively. The stones' warmth and shifting carvings create tactile specificity that drives action. Setting evolves from dead space to alive with engines coughing to life, though some descriptions lean generic ("margin of daylight").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal searching to collective reignition through the stones' activation—a deepening that transforms "waiting" into "listening." The hum's progression (feet→arm→chest→bay) creates physical escalation. Cost appears in "wreckage" and accepting the "mess," though the rebellion's specific opposition remains vague.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between "forgetting" and "remembering," with the stones as literal memory-holders. The final insight—"meaning wasn't found in clean victories, but in the stubborn, thunderous act"—reframes the rebellion without moralizing. The opera glasses' transformation into conduits deepens the seeing/listening motif effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical density with effective rhythm modulation ("a yawn in the margin of daylight"). Some passages achieve strong perceptual signature ("toes curling against grit"), but occasionally drift toward elevated register inconsistent with Lena's embodied perspective ("thunderous serenity," "war drum made of stars").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with purposeful figurative language, though some metaphors strain ("war drum made of stars"). Template cadence appears in "She + verb" constructions across multiple paragraphs. The paraphrase loop of "remembered/remembering" in the final section dulls momentum, and "meaning wasn't found...but in" reads as explicit thematic statement rather than earned resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of ancient stones as rebellion catalyst offers fresh specificity within familiar uprising territory. The opera glasses' transformation from vintage heirloom to activation device shows inventive repurposing. However, the rebellion framework itself follows recognizable patterns without significant transformation of the core template.</comment>
