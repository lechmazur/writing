<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's internal contradiction between isolation and connection plays out through embodied choices—the blood offering, accepting Elias's gift—with visible cost in her "quivering" hands and years of closure. The final renunciation of self-protection ("let herself believe in the shape of an open door") is earned through prior guardedness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through garden decay, gauge tooth accumulation, and harbor rhythm until the final image of belief in "an open door" crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost ("for the first time in years"). The pattern of locked/unlocked deepens from physical tools to emotional states.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fire escape functions as micro-setting constraining choices—five stories up isolates yet allows moonlight's "sharp" carving of shadows. The gauge teeth become tactile tools that "score the earth" and later symbolize unlocking, while the harbor's rhythm threads through as environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through textural deepening: dying garden, wilting basil, blood offering, then Elias's arrival shifts the dynamic. The dominant stake—whether to remain closed or risk connection—tightens when she accepts his gauge tooth, foreclosing her isolation with visible cost in letting herself "believe."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lock/unlock metaphor emerges organically through gauge teeth that measure "the space between what was locked and what was free," culminating in "two keys to a lock neither of them needed anymore." The final image of belief in "an open door" resonantly answers whether healing requires risk.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through Lena's war-scarred lens—moonlight becomes "a blade left too long in rain," the harbor carries "warning." Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("Plants like iron"/"Plants like water"), though brief convergence in final beats slightly dulls distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong figurative language occasionally tips toward density ("luminous harbor air," "silvering the water like a blade") without always advancing pressure. Some paraphrase loops appear ("quivering hush"/"tremor in her hands"), though the prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The locksmith gauge teeth as gardening tools offers a fresh angle on healing-through-cultivation stories. The specific detail of scoring earth with lock-picking tools to plant seeds transforms the expected metaphor, though the broader arc of isolation-to-connection follows familiar patterns.</comment>
