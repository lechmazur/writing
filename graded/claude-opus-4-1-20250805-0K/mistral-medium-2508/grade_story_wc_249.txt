<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira's internal conflict between being a "vault of auroral sorrow" and her desire for autonomy drives clear motivation, with embodied details like "fingers twitched, drumming a restless rhythm." The transformation from passive victim to active agent releasing memories shows genuine change with visible cost. However, some moments lean toward abstract emotional summary ("vault of auroral sorrow") rather than fully embodied contradiction in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural closure where Lira's drumming releases the entangled memories, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost ("for the first time in years, her mind was her own"). The pattern of water-memory-sound builds coherently to the release sequence. Minor deduction for slightly abstract framing of the treatment's mechanics early on, though the ending's embodied action compensates well.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden with crystalline reeds and auric lagoon creates a vivid, purpose-driven setting where water holds memories and reeds respond to frequencies. The environment directly constrains choice—Lira must use the garden's resonator properties to untangle memories. The synesthetic details ("gold and violet" memories) enhance atmosphere while serving the story's logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Lira shifts from passive suffering to active rebellion, culminating in the frantic drumming that releases memories. The cost is visible in the "gasping fish" of surfacing memories and her "slow and shaking" exhale afterward. Stakes deepen effectively though the opposition (doctors) remains mostly off-page, limiting direct conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the tension between medical "progress" and personal "theft," with the final image of wild memories "finding their way home" offering resonant answer without moralizing. The water-as-memory metaphor sustains throughout, and Lira's transformation from vessel to liberator embodies the thematic question. Slight abstraction in places ("vault of auroral sorrow") prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical control ("hummed at the hush of the universe inhaling") and consistent POV. The perceptual signature shows in synesthetic details and water-focused imagery. Some moments drift toward elevated register ("auroral sorrow," "infinite") that slightly exceed Lira's established lexicon, though the overall texture remains compelling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure, though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("crystalline reeds bending under the weight of frequencies"). Minor template cadence in the "She called it" repetition and occasional abstract phrasing ("vault of auroral sorrow"). The closing sequence maintains clarity and momentum effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-manipulation and sound-healing creates non-obvious angle on the experimental subject trope. The specific mechanism of drumming water to release stolen memories feels earned and particular. The transformation from medical victim to self-liberator through the garden's unique properties shows genuine ingenuity beyond template rebellion.</comment>
