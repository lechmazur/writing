I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through pattern accumulation (naming the stones), density increase, and a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake.

<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action—tracing tesserae while haunted by specific memories. The commander's transformation shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("The sword clattered to the ground"). Internal conflict manifests physically in both characters' hands reaching for stones, with the final renunciation/joining earning its cost through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost when the commander joins Elias's work, crystallizing a Charged Poise where both men cradle sorrow "in arms of steel and shattered light." The accumulative pattern of naming stones builds to this reconfiguration of enemy-to-participant. Cost is legible in "my son's name"—the commander's personal loss that reweights his prior violence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plaza's shattered tesserae function as micro-setting that constrains and enables the central action—Elias can only work through these specific fragments. Sensory detail is selective ("charred cedar and something older") and the minaret's skeletal presence haunts every beat. The stones warming and glowing directly participates in closure, though some spatial choreography could be clearer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether memory can resist erasure through naming—deepens when the commander arrives with his sword, forcing immediate physical danger. The escalation from solitary work to confrontation to shared grief forecloses Elias's isolation with visible cost. "Mercy isn't what you burn. It's what you carry" crystallizes the stakes at the decisive moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of naming stones after the dead, avoiding abstract moralizing until the earned confrontation. The final image of cracks filling with gold offers a non-literal answer to whether mercy can survive violence—it transforms through remembrance. "The great fire had tried to erase them. Instead, it had made them unforgettable" reweights all prior material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elegiac tone with controlled rhythm ("The plaza had once been a jewel—now it was a wound"). Dialogue carries subtext effectively, particularly in the commander's "They'll kill you for this" masking his own grief. Some filter constructions ("He recognized") could be more immediate, and occasional register elevation ("retrocognitively trapped") slightly strains the POV's lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful fragments. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. However, some metaphoric density in peak beats ("dying prayer," "skeletal," "heretic's compassion" in quick succession) and occasional template cadence ("He began with... He moved to...") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of memory-as-resistance through naming transforms the familiar post-disaster narrative. The specific synthesis of Islamic architectural elements (minaret, tesserae) with the act of renaming creates fresh texture. The commander's transformation from enforcer to mourner offers a non-obvious moral calculus, though the "gentle radical" archetype itself is somewhat familiar.</comment>
