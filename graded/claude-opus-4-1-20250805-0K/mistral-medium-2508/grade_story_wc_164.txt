<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The recollectionist's discovery that "the missing pieces were never gone. They were inside her all along" represents earned internal change with visible cost (blood glowing iridescent, memories surging into her). Interiority is concrete and embodied through physical interactions with crater glass, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("paths disappeared so new ones could be found").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist absorbs memories and transforms (glowing blood, seeds rooting through skin). Cost is visible through physical transformation and the "weight of a thousand half-remembered lives," though the precise mechanics of how she "transliterates emotions into colors" remains vague.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The geode cave functions as more than setting—its crater glass walls contain memories that directly enable the protagonist's transformation, and the "cheerful gloom" atmosphere supports the paradoxical tone. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (salt-sting, blue-green hue, glass clinking like bones), with the cave actively participating through breathing and sealing itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking missing pieces to discovering they're internal, with time pressure from the migrating bird's "hurry" message. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through choosing to "let them in," though the conflict lacks a clear oppositional force beyond abstract "memory fading."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of crater glass as memory map, with the final realization that "paths disappeared so new ones could be found" offering resonant answer without stating a moral. The fisherman's daughter and merchant's stories provide specific emotional grounding, though some passages approach abstract philosophizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with distinctive perceptual signature ("sea-foam recollectionist," "breadcrumbs of possibility"), though occasional register drift occurs ("transliterating emotions"). The prose successfully teaches its pattern of metaphorical density early and maintains it through closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("crater glass embedded in the iridescent walls like forgotten stars") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "missing pieces" and abstract constructions ("the universe's way of being kind"). Some sentences do multiple jobs effectively, though density occasionally obscures clarity ("seeds marking the way like breadcrumbs of possibility, each one whispering conjecture").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of a "recollectionist" who physically absorbs others' memories through crater glass offers fresh angle on memory/identity themes. The synthesis of geological imagery (geode, crater glass) with emotional archaeology feels specific and earned, with the bird as time-keeper adding urgency without feeling forced.</comment>
