<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to understand the jasmine's night-blooming drives consistent action through painting, examining postcards, and pressing against the glass. Her internal journey from seeking answers to accepting silence shows genuine transformation with visible cost—she leaves behind her work and the pavilion. The revelation about the flowers in the glass creates a concrete turning point, though some interior passages drift toward abstract philosophizing rather than embodied reaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered discoveries—postcards, glass layers, preserved flowers—culminating in Liora's Resonant Reconfiguration as she shifts from seeking to listening. The closure lands with clear cost: she abandons her artistic work and the pavilion itself, accepting that "some questions weren't meant to be solved / Only held." Orientation anchors (Liora, pavilion, end of winter) establish by line 3, and the pattern of revelation-through-stillness holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The amber pavilion and cathedral window function as more than setting—they constrain and enable Liora's discovery, with the glass literally containing the preserved jasmine that triggers her transformation. Sensory details like "fingers stained with pigment," "cold seeping into her bones," and "scent thick and sweet" ground abstract concepts. The pavilion's transformation from workspace to "lantern in the gathering dark" charges the final image as Liora walks away.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—deepens through accumulative pressure as each discovery (postcards, glass shivering, preserved flowers) reweights Liora's approach. The key escalation occurs when the glass reveals its layers, forcing her choice between continuing to paint/document or accepting silence. Cost is visible: she abandons months of work and leaves barefoot into the night, though the middle section could tighten its pressure points.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of active seeking versus receptive listening emerges through concrete details—night-blooming flowers, layered glass, faded postcards—rather than direct statement. The final postcard "Some things only reveal themselves when you stop looking" crystallizes this without preaching. However, the ending's extended philosophical meditation ("Some questions weren't meant to be solved / Only held") shifts toward explicit thematic summary, and several passages abstract into conceptual territory rather than staying grounded in scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistent texture through fragments, repetition, and rhythmic control: "The pavilion stood. / The flowers listened. / And the world, for a moment, was perfect." POV remains stable with Liora's selective perception filtering details like the jasmine's night-blooming and the glass's hidden layers. The fragmentary structure in the final third effectively mimics the "hush" the story explores, though occasionally drifts toward overwrought lyricism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments like "glass shivered" and "light bleeding through the paper like a wound" demonstrate precise imagery, but repetitive structures proliferate in the ending: "The postcards would stay. / The murals would fade. / But the hush would remain." Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "The world was quiet. / And in that quiet, everything made sense" essentially restates the same idea. The final third contains excessive one-line paragraphs that fragment momentum, and phrases like "earth and possibility" lean toward abstract poeticism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of flowers revealing themselves through stillness rather than darkness offers a fresh angle on discovery narratives. The preserved jasmine between glass layers provides an unexpected physical manifestation of temporal preservation. The story commits to its lyric-accumulative structure, though the extended philosophical ending and familiar artist-seeking-meaning framework prevent higher distinction.</comment>
