<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "shape the unseen" drives coherent choices through the veil transition and his decision to sacrifice twilight juice to sharpen the girl's edges. The internal contradiction between his hunger for shaping and his ultimate choice to let wonder pass through him lands with visible cost. Minor deduction for the girl's underdeveloped presence and some abstract phrasing ("insatiable craving") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the veil crossing serving as the decisive turn where Elias discovers the fading orchard layer and chooses to give rather than take. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as he transforms from shaper to conduit, with visible cost in his disappearance and the children's recognition of impossible colors. The seed's transformation from heirloom to bridge and the silver sapling's appearance confirm the price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The parapet, waterfall veil, and endless orchard with sunset fruit create a vivid setting that constrains choices—Elias must pass through the veil to access the other layer, and the fading quality of the fruit drives his intervention. The silver-leafed sapling and colors "no one had names for" charge the final image. Setting actively shapes the story's central transaction between worlds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder across the veil—escalates from seed contemplation through the girl's fading state to Elias's choice to paint her with twilight juice. His disappearance and the emergence of the silver sapling show clear cost. The tension between capturing/shaping versus passing through deepens meaningfully, though the girl's agency remains minimal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the transformation of "capturing essence" into "passing through"—wonder as transmission rather than possession. The children's instant recognition versus the old men's bewilderment creates resonant irony. The final image of saplings "whispering in a language made of light" offers a non-literal answer about how beauty persists through sacrifice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception fitting a pruner who "listens" to cuts. Some elevated diction ("parapet," "insatiable craving") occasionally drifts from Elias's working-class register. The prose modulates effectively during the veil crossing, though dialogue between Elias and the girl lacks the subtext depth of the narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("fruit that glowed like captured sunsets"), though occasional abstraction ("insatiable craving to shape the unseen") and mild redundancy in the closing meditation on wonder. Some template phrasing in dialogue tags ("she whispered," "he said"). Information density is high in descriptive passages but thins during the extended philosophical conclusion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of an orchard existing in layers with transferable essence offers fresh transformation of portal fantasy. The specific synthesis of pruning expertise with otherworldly sacrifice feels earned. The inversion from capturing to releasing wonder and the children's innate recognition versus adult blindness provide non-obvious insight into how beauty propagates.</comment>
