I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens**: Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant with Causal elements). The story builds through layered imagery and temporal metaphors, with causal linkages in Elias's reconstruction of the vase shard leading to the vision.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation as poet-revolutionary seeking revision over vengeance is distinctive and consistent. His internal contradiction between accepting failure and needing vindication drives the closure choice. The moment where "the weight in his chest lighter than it had been in years" embodies genuine emotional release with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration achieved through the vision sequence where the cathedral briefly reassembles, forcing Taelis to carry "uneasy knowledge." The cost is visible—the shard turns to dust, permanently foreclosing this method. The hybrid lens holds, though the causal mechanism of the shard's power could be clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The asteroid cathedral with its "time-strands thick as rope, pulsing with memories" creates a distinctive setting that constrains choice—Elias must work within the storm's charged particles. The baroque spires, irradiated silk, and cracked dome all function as resources that enable the climactic vision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—legitimizing a lost civilization's legacy—escalates through Elias's decade of counter-theories to physical proof via the shard. The confrontation with Taelis crystallizes opposing worldviews. However, the archaeologists' threat feels somewhat abstract; their power to diminish the Republic could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between history and poetry, data and memory. The final line "It was beautiful, after all. And it was his" reweights the entire narrative from loss to ownership. The worship of visible time versus fearing it creates genuine philosophical depth without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "threads unspooling from the wrists of its citizens until the day the threads snapped." The perceptual signature—Elias seeing time as beautiful rather than terrible—remains consistent. Taelis's brief dialogue effectively contrasts with Elias's poetic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and information density, particularly in the opening paragraph's world-building. Some metaphorical density in places ("tangled, glowing web, draping the asteroid in strands thick as rope") but it serves the accumulative texture. Clean grammar and varied syntax throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of a civilization that made time visible as threads is genuinely fresh. The transformation of archaeological dispute into poetry versus data creates an unexpected angle. The risk of dense temporal metaphors pays off in the vision sequence where abstraction becomes concrete.</comment>
