<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer's motivation crystallizes through embodied details (watch burning against ribs, trembling hands) and culminates in a earned renunciation of the cipher for direct communication. Internal contradiction plays out between stealing moments and learning to speak, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the compressed timeframe.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks and density shifts that reweight meaning, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the dreamer chooses direct speech over the cipher's indirect revelations. Cost is legible in "her heart no longer a cipher, but a door" and the abandoned watch. Minor orientation wobble with the confidence man's temporal position but recovers through the vision sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The library's impossible architecture and mist function as active constraints, forcing urgency and dissolving with the second letter's arrival. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (ink-breath, parchment over bone), though some descriptions lean slightly ornamental. The watch and path work as micro-settings that constrain choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the library's dissolution tied to the second letter's posting, forcing the dreamer to act under time pressure. The watch's cost (stealing from future to pay for past) creates genuine trade-offs. Agency manifests in the final choice to write rather than decode, though the middle section could tighten slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the gap between spoken/unspoken, culminating in "Some things only needed to be said." The stolen page's message "You were always the one who listened" reweights the entire cipher quest. Subtext operates through the watch's deception and the library's true nature without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through selective, dreamlike attention to texture (amber glow, velvet voice) with controlled rhythm that accelerates during the library's collapse. Some filter verbs ("she saw him") but voice-motivated. Dialogue minimal but carries subtext when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong opening and closing lines with varied syntax and purposeful compression. Information density high in key beats. Some metaphorical density in places ("curling like ink," "velvet unspooling") and occasional template structures ("She had to move faster") but generally clean propulsion. Minor repetition of "mist" without always advancing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of epistolary regret with magical realism through the cipher-watch and library of unspoken words. The transformation from seeking the unsaid to learning to say carries emotional specificity. Some familiar dream-logic elements but executed with particular detail and genuine risk in the collapsing library sequence.</comment>
