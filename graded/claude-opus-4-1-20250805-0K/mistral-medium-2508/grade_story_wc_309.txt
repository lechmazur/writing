<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marlin's motivation is clear and grounded in his specific failure—the candle that won't extinguish becomes both flaw and strength. The internal contradiction between his "unremarkable" label and his perception of "lingering luminance" drives authentic choices. The final choice to walk away with his unruly flame shows earned renunciation with visible cost (leaving the keystone behind).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Marlin refuses the Conservatory's demand to explain, walking out with his transformed candle. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as images (candle, keystone, light) accumulate meaning through the climb. Cost is visible in his rejection of "mastery" and the keystone abandonment. Minor orientation wobble with "mist walking" transition deducts slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The spire functions as both physical obstacle and metaphorical divide between automated creation below and stubborn sacred above. The pocket garden's impossible summer charges the thematic turn. The keystone's light revealing "veins of gold in the ice, patterns in the frost" constrains Marlin's final choice to leave it behind.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from exile/penance to understanding the sacred's true location—"not in the spectacle" but in stubborn persistence. The keeper's challenge ("mastery's just another kind of forgetting") forces Marlin's stance crystallization. Cost is legible when he leaves the keystone for others to "puzzle over" while keeping his unruly flame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the candle's stubborn flame versus the engines' automated perfection. The ending's merged lights casting "shadows that moved like living things—imperfect, flickering, *alive*" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Minor deduction for the keeper's slightly on-the-nose "make things instead of asking a machine to."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm ("a jagged tooth of ice piercing the underbelly"). The keeper's voice is distinct ("dry as dead leaves"). Perceptual signature strong in how Marlin notices light and luminance throughout. Minor convergence in dialogue between keeper and candle's whisper.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful imagery. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("storm-wracked sky," "wreathed in frostbloom") but serves the fantastical register. The final image of the candle roaring "Louder" against automated hymns lands with precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of failed magic student finding power in imperfection feels fresh against typical chosen-one narratives. The "lingering luminance" concept transforms the underdog trope through specific detail. Risk-taking in rejecting the expected triumph (leaving the keystone) heightens thematic stakes.</comment>
