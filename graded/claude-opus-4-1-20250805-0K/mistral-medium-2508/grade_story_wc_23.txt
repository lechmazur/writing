<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's transformation from ship navigator to "patchwork navigator" who builds maps for the lost is earned through specific loss (the lighthouse failure). Her contradictory impulses—building to chart loss while helping others find their way back—create genuine tension. The final choice to continue building despite ambiguity shows agency with visible emotional cost ("the weight in her chest felt lighter").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered calls, maps, and the censer foot's warming until the final image of Lena rolling fresh paper crystallizes her acceptance of this role (Earned Stasis). Cost is visible in "the weight in her chest" transforming to something "lighter"—she accepts helping others while carrying her own loss. The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (signal station, cliffs, Lena).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The signal station functions as both setting and metaphor—"clung to the edge of the cliffs like a barnacle" with "dying relay switches." The censer foot's patina shifts from "cold" to "warmed" to "the color of old bruises," constraining Lena's ritual and charging the final image. Sensory detail filters through her navigator's perspective: coordinates, graph paper, the station as "a ship of its own."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Lena can transform loss into navigation for others—deepens through the progression of calls (clear on waxing moon, dissolving on wane) to her active instruction: "Start walking." The moon's phases create natural pressure that forces her repeated choice. Cost appears in accepting she may be calling "echoes of herself" while still building.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "reverse migrations, paths leading inland from the sea"—the drowned finding their way home. The censer foot that "listened" rather than glowing or singing subverts expected mysticism. The final image of maps as both "directions" and "anchors" offers a non-literal answer about how we navigate loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent maritime metaphor throughout ("fathoms," "divining rod," "ship of its own"). Dialogue carries authentic subtext—riddles that require translation, the woman's hitching breath. The perceptual signature of a navigator pervades: everything becomes coordinates, charts, courses. Brief dialogue convergence at "Is this—?" / "The way back" reads intentional at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful repetition ("She hadn't always been," "Now, she built"). Some figurative density in places ("breathing patina," "divining rod," "ship of its own") but serves the accumulative design. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and stakes simultaneously. Minor template cadence in "She [verb]" patterns costs precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of navigating loss through midnight calls from the possibly-dead transforms familiar ghost story elements. The specific synthesis of maritime navigation with emotional geography feels fresh. The reverse migrations metaphor—paths leading inland from the sea—offers genuine conceptual originality that couldn't work with different professions or settings.</comment>
