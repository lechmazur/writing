I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring an **Accumulative/Textural** drive lens based on the density patterns, lyric callbacks, and the final resonant reconfiguration where the choir finds presence through absence.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation through loss is deeply embodied ("expectantly resigned sigh," "scribbling not melodies but silences"). The four remaining choir members have distinct physical markers and arrive with earned wariness. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of their simultaneous arrival, but the final choice to join the negative-space humming carries genuine cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the choir learns to "listen to the cracks" rather than restore what was. The rosette's transformation from artifact to vibrating witness effectively charges the ending. Accumulative lens holds throughout with pattern breaks ("Now, only four remained") that reweight the dominant stake of artistic persistence through hatred's erosion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library as "velvet" sanctuary and autumn's deliberate stripping mirror the choir's reduction beautifully. The rosette constrains choice—Elias must work with remnants rather than wholeness. "Stained-glass windows bleeding amber" and "leaves falling silent" create a lived-in sensory world that pressures the final decision to embrace incompleteness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving art against hatred's unlearning—tightens through reduction (twenty to four voices) with visible cost. The shift from trying to "braid into harmony" to accepting "negative space where music used to be" effectively narrows options. Slightly limited by the lack of active opposition in the present scene, though the accumulated losses provide sufficient pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges gorgeously through the rosette's journey from "vibrant inlay dulled to old honey" to remembering vibration. The concept of "subtracting noise" to find meaning resonates without didacticism. "It wasn't about fixing what was broken. It was about listening to the cracks" offers a non-literal answer that reweights all prior loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature filters everything through musical metaphor ("exhaled the scent," "last note of a dying song"). Controlled psychic distance moves from external library to intimate humming. Brief dialogue carries subtext effectively ("You're late" holding "no reproach, only quiet acknowledgment"). Minor convergence in the choir members' minimal dialogue, but the voice coheres under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong figurative control ("bleeding amber," "traveled stillness") with good information density. Some metaphor density in opening paragraphs borders on overwriting but serves the accumulative design. Deduction for occasional abstraction ("the way hatred worked—the way it unlearned people") and filter-verb clustering in the reflection passages, though these don't touch the crystalline closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The central conceit of notation through absence ("scribbling not melodies but silences") offers fresh insight into artistic persistence. The specific detail of the "bullet-scarred folder" and each member's particular trauma elevates beyond generic loss narrative. The transformation of incompleteness into presence through "listening to the cracks" feels earned and non-obvious.</comment>
