<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's internal contradiction between wanting to hate the tourists and letting them misread the photograph as a bird shows genuine complexity. The embodied pause technique ("press your palms into your thighs until the sting overrides the echo of screams") grounds her trauma response in specific physical action. Her final choice to prune deadwood while leaving "the rest to grow" earns its resonance through prior dramatization of grief and the cypress leaf ritual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the photograph's journey from pocket to branch to absence, with each stage reweighting Lena's relationship to grief. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis—she doesn't let go but "makes room," with visible cost in the empty pocket space and the physical pain she induces. The orientation anchors (arboretum, cliffs, fig trees) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The arboretum functions as more than backdrop—it's a "pearl of stillness" that enables Lena's somatic practice and provides the cypress that catches the photograph. Sensory details layer effectively ("salt and the ghost of foghorns," "citrus and resin"). The ancient cypress actively constrains choice by catching the photograph at the precise height where a child can misread it, though some descriptive passages lean toward the atmospheric without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Lena can transform grief into something generative—escalates through the photograph's release, the child's misreading, and her decision not to correct them. The cost is legible in "the empty space where the photograph had been" and her acceptance that roots are "heavier" than grief. While the story lacks dramatic reversals, the accumulative pressure coheres around her shifting relationship to loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme emerges through concrete particulars: the fruitless fig trees, the photograph's transformation from burden to "bird," the cypress leaf replacing the photo in her pocket. The final insight that optimism is "meeting [pain] without flinching" avoids platitude by grounding in specific embodied action. The story resists tidy resolution—Lena keeps her grief but changes her stance toward it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent close-third POV with distinctive perceptual signatures ("the wind carried salt and the ghost of foghorns"). Free indirect style works cleanly ("She wanted to hate them"). Some passages drift toward elevated register ("the stubborn persistence of life") that slightly exceeds Lena's established lexicon during emotional peaks, though the overall texture remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("henna still wet on her hands, the drone a speck in the sky no one had noticed yet") but suffers from occasional abstract elevation ("something heavier—something like roots") and repetitive structure in the philosophical passages. The italicized therapy-speak (*embodied pause*, *You don't have to let go. You have to make room.*) creates mild register friction. Information density varies, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others loop conceptually.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story transforms familiar trauma-recovery material through specific details: the drone strike at a wedding, the somatic freeze technique, the arboretum as active refuge rather than passive escape. The child's misreading of the photograph as a bird offers a non-obvious reframing of grief. While working within recognizable therapeutic frameworks, the execution feels particular to Lena's experience.</comment>
