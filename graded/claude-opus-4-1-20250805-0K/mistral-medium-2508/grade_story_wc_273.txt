I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation crystallizes through concrete embodied details—the "milky eyes burned with serene anger" and his physical transformation from using the ink. The internal contradiction between hunting and understanding lands with earned weight, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("Time didn't slow in crisis, he realized. It *fractured*") rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Kael's decision to follow rather than kill, with visible cost in his transformed body and the risk of stepping through. The causal lens holds as each discovery (the encampment victims, the thief's pattern, the broken spiral) drives Kael's tactical shift. Minor orientation delay with "no one here knew it" before establishing the "here."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment and frozen victims create visceral constraint—"a child's hand outstretched toward a fallen cup, a woman's mouth half-open in a plea." The disappearing ink's physical behavior ("branching like lightning") directly enables the story's mechanics. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through Kael's approach to the thief.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through Kael's agency: from tracking to confrontation to the choice to understand rather than destroy. The cost manifests in his physical transformation and the irrevocable step through the ink pattern. The revelation that the thief is "collecting pieces" meaningfully reweights the conflict, though the final escalation could push harder against Kael's initial stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of fractured versus stolen time emerges through concrete action—the frozen victims, the disappearing patterns, Kael's own temporal displacement. The final image of clocks starting and stopping "somewhere" offers resonant ambiguity about time's nature. The hunter-becoming-hunted reversal deepens without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice emerges in constructions like "the kind that didn't shout but carved rivers through stone" and the controlled rhythm of short declaratives ("Kael didn't run. He walked."). Some register elevation in peak moments ("consciously wild enough") slightly strains the established voice. The sparse dialogue carries appropriate weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose maintains strong momentum with varied sentence lengths and purposeful fragments ("No body. No blood."). Information density stays high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor repetitive structures appear ("He had been tracking," "He'd vanished," "He would follow") but don't significantly impede flow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The time-thief concept transforms through specific execution—victims frozen mid-gesture, ink as temporal doorways, the revelation of collection versus theft. The albino tracker with transformed blood offers fresh specificity. The ending's pivot from vengeance to understanding provides genuine surprise grounded in prior setup.</comment>
