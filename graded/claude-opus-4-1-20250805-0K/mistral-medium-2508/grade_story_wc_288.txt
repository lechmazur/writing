<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lior's evolution from hunter's guilt through brittle awakening to acceptance is earned through concrete interaction with the Hesperornis, with the final choice to let the bird go showing genuine cost. The internal contradiction between seeking forgiveness and needing independence manifests through embodied action (touching books, holding the sundial as shield), though some transitions between emotional states could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lior's realization that "to translate isolation into independence was to stop asking for forgiveness," with visible cost in releasing the Hesperornis and stepping through previously unopened doors. The accumulative/textural lens holds as pattern breaks (the bird striking its reflection, the book of mirrors appearing) build toward the final reconfiguration where both beings accept their status as "ones who refused to stay dead."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tidal library's floating shelves that pulse with cloud rhythm and the atomically reflective sundial create a vivid otherworld that constrains choices—books only appear at specific tidal moments, the stone circle's hum dictates when translation is possible. The brass sundial functions as both timekeeper and mirror, its seven-shard reflection pattern driving the story's central revelation about memory and isolation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: the hum climbing to teeth-aching pitch, the Hesperornis's violent lunge at its reflection sending shockwaves, culminating in Lior's choice to release the bird rather than maintain their shared isolation. The cost is legible in the final separation—both characters choosing independence over the comfort of shared extinction-memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of isolation versus independence emerges through concrete images—the mirror-book showing unbroken flocks, the sundial drinking the offered feather—rather than declaration. The final insight that "brittle awakening didn't hurt. It was just the cost of being alive" reweights all prior material without moralizing, though the "translator's hour" concept could resonate more deeply with the central transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistency through selective perception (books "pulsed with the rhythm of clouds," brass "warm as blood") and controlled rhythm that accelerates during the confrontation. The prose successfully modulates between contemplative passages and urgent action, though occasional filter constructions ("Lior realized," "he understood") slightly diminish immediacy during peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the sundial as timekeeper/mirror/shield), though some repetitive constructions appear ("Lior had spent," "Lior had learned," "Lior exhaled"). The prose achieves memorable specificity in phrases like "bones groaning like old ship timber" and "Morse code of extinction," but filter verb clusters in the middle section reduce propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of extinct species, reincarnation memory, and tidal library creates a genuinely fresh premise that couldn't work with simple substitutions. The concept of beings who "refused to stay dead" coexisting in a floating library transforms extinction narrative tropes through specific detail, and the risk of the lyric-fantastical mode pays off in the charged final image of stepping into "rain and possibility."</comment>
