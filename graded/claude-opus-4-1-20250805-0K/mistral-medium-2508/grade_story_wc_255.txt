<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias's colorblindness creating a unique perceptual world ("colors had never been the point") and his plant language system show strong character specificity. The relationship with Liora develops through concrete actions (basil pot, dandelion, teaching moment) with embodied tension. Deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("Beginning," "made sense") in closure beats that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through plant arrangements building to connection. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Liora's request to learn the language and their shared music-making crystallizes their bond with felt cost ("Some awakenings were worth any cost"). The phoenix cycle frames temporal urgency effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The courtyard's post-phoenix warmth, embers in cobblestones, and cracked vase create vivid sensory grounding. Plants function as active setting elements constraining communication choices. The kiln and glassblowing details integrate naturally with character relationships and thematic concerns about imperfection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on connection despite communication barriers, escalating from Elias's solitary practice through Liora's "I'm listening" signal to their final shared understanding. The phoenix's seventh-year cycle adds temporal pressure. Cost is felt in the old woman's bargains and Elias's willingness to pay ("I'd pay it gladly").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of finding beauty in imperfection emerges organically through the cracked vase ("ruined"/"perfect"), the broken concertina creating music, and the plant language's idiosyncratic meanings. The final image of the blooming courtyard resonates without stating a moral, reweighting all prior imperfections as generative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct voice through selective perception (feeling Liora's flush through shoulder contact, not seeing it) and the plant-language system. Some register elevation in peak moments ("Beginning," "made sense") slightly undermines POV consistency. Dialogue effectively carries subtext through gesture and implication.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Deductions for abstract labeling in high-pressure moments ("Beginning," "made sense"), some repetitive phrasing around plant arrangements, and occasional register drift ("undeniable pressure"). Information density is good but inconsistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of colorblind artist using plant arrangements as language creates genuine originality. The phoenix-as-cyclical-renewal alongside human connection offers non-obvious thematic layering. The cracked vase as perfect rather than ruined transforms a familiar trope meaningfully.</comment>
