<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to "unbuild" and find "the texture of time" drives consistent choices through maze navigation and photograph interaction, with embodied stress ("bones ached," "breath ragged"). The final renunciation of solving for the center in favor of designing edges shows earned change with visible cost. Internal contradiction between escape and understanding operates throughout, though some philosophical articulation ("texture wasn't something to discover...to survive") edges toward diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered time-loops, photograph dissolution, and geometric warping, culminating in Liora's conceptual repricing that shifts from solving to designing edges. The halo fragment's destruction releases trapped moments with clear cost ("collapsed...hands shaking"). Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words with Liora in the living bridge garden.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hyperbolic geometry constrains movement ("sideways, along the curve where the garden's geometry bent time") and the living bridge's transformation into spiral staircase enables passage "through" time. Sensory specificity ("ozone and crushed lavender," "motes of gold") filters through Liora's maze-designer perception. The garden's final sigh and texture beneath her palm charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from unbuilding a maze to being trapped in recursive time, with the halo fragment's increasing pull ("hummed...burned...ached") driving urgency. The reversal when Liora realizes she's "trapped not in space but in when" forces her sideways escape strategy. Cost manifests in the screaming photographs and physical collapse, though the resolution through hurling the fragment arrives somewhat abruptly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The texture/fabric metaphor coheres throughout—time as material to be woven, stitched, survived—without explicit moralizing. The final insight that texture must be survived rather than discovered reweights all prior maze-solving attempts. Subtext operates through the fading photographs as lost possibilities and the garden's organic responses ("shuddered," "sighed").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Liora's geometric/architectural lens ("fractal patterns," "hyperbolic geometry") and tactile focus on textures. Syntax mirrors stress through fragmentation ("Find the texture. Find the seam.") and elongation during revelation. Minor register drift occurs with "retrocognitively trapped" feeling more clinical than the established lyric voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("branches twisting in fractal patterns only she could decipher—each curve a question"). Some metaphor density in peak beats ("needle stitching her into a pattern") without clear payoff. Template cadence appears briefly ("She reached...She climbed") but varies sufficiently. The opening and closing images of texture create effective bookends.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hyperbolic maze geometry allowing sideways movement through time offers fresh spatial-temporal mechanics. The halo fragment as hunger-driven artifact that pulls toward trapped memories transforms the typical magical object. Liora's final choice to design edges rather than centers provides non-obvious resolution to the maze-designer premise.</comment>
