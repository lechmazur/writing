<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's motivation through grief-driven obsession with "hunting potential" is clear and embodied through concrete actions like stealing morgue footage and manipulating the observatory equipment. The geode as "unused time" creates a specific, non-generic driver. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract notion of "perturbation" in peak moments that could use more embodied grounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the charged final image of Lena "hunting" in darkness. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where she crystallizes as "the perturbation" with visible cost (observatory's death, isolation). Deduction for slight ambiguity around whether she actually altered the past or just witnessed it—the "awakening" vs "failure" tension needs sharper resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory as "splinter in the sky" with groaning steel ribs creates vivid constraint, and the geode's physical properties (jagged surface, warming pulse) directly enable the climactic action. The storm below mirrors internal chaos effectively. Setting constrains choice when the breakers cool and systems fail, forcing Lena's decisive move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal grief to actively manipulating reality's fabric, with the scientists' warnings creating external pressure. The cost materializes when Lena destroys the observatory's systems and isolates herself in darkness. Slight deduction because the middle section's "perturbation theory as knife" metaphor doesn't fully translate to concrete escalation beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the geode as "unused time" and crystallizes in the distinction between fixing the past versus hunting where change was possible. The final image of Lena "hunting" in darkness resonantly reweights her journey from victim to active force. Strong avoidance of explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical density ("lightning stitching ruins," "perturbation theory as knife"). POV remains stable with Lena's selective perception of technical details filtered through grief. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the established voice ("intangibly tangible," "bleak exhilaration").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong propulsion with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density high in most beats. Deductions for abstract phrasing in the perturbation theory section that slows momentum and the slightly overwrought "pocket of unused time" metaphor cluster that approaches density excess without full payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief narrative with scientific/cosmic horror elements, particularly the concept of hunting "unmade past" rather than changing it. The geode as inherited scientific artifact that enables temporal manipulation is specific. The wedding-drone strike opener immediately establishes non-generic stakes.</comment>
