I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered images and moments that accumulate meaning, with the archway serving as a loom that weaves time and connection.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation crystallizes through concrete action (carving the hand into the archway) with clear internal consistency. The contradiction between being lost/marooned and his artistic impulse to leave marks drives genuine choice. Minor deduction for slight emotional abstraction in the middle section.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative closure where the archway-as-loom revelation reconfigures meaning and Elias's carved hand becomes another layer in time's weave. The cost is felt through his empty pockets but fuller understanding. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The archway functions brilliantly as both setting and constraint, forcing Elias's choice and enabling the story's resolution. Salt-crusted stone, storm details, and the physical carving create vivid sensory grounding that shapes action throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative density as the lantern slide reveals layers of previous visitors, building pressure that forces Elias's decision to carve. The storm's approval and path revelation provide earned resolution with clear cost (lost slide, emptied pockets).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the archway-as-loom metaphor and the accumulation of human marks across time. The final gift of driftwood with archway stone embedded offers resonant closure without stating a moral. "We were here" crystallizes the universal need for connection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("blue dot winking out like a dying star"). POV maintains consistent close third with effective free indirect style. Minor register elevation in philosophical moments slightly exceeds character lexicon but serves the piece's texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("turbine-hum filled his skull") and slight metaphor density in peak moments. The "sideways light threading through storm like golden stitches" risks purple prose but mostly lands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of driftwood artistry with temporal connection creates non-obvious resonance. The archway-as-loom concept and lantern slide's "timewoven alliances" offer genuine originality. The specific detail of preserved violets and compass rose carvings grounds abstraction effectively.</comment>
