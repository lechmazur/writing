<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mender's internal conflict between pride and understanding drives genuine change, with contradictory impulses (teaching vows are deciduous while drilling wisdom "like a nail") acting simultaneously. The final choice to eat the apple and carry the lighter satchel shows earned transformation with visible cost—three years of separation paid. Minor deduction for the daughter remaining mostly in reflection rather than present pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered symbols (ribbon, seed, apple) that reweight at closure when the mender finally understands their daughter saw cracks they couldn't. The eating of the apple creates Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost—accepting the daughter's wisdom over their own pride. Orientation anchors (cathedral orchard, three years since contract broke) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard hybrid setting constrains choice effectively—the mender must dig where "light bends" through the broken rose window. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (loam, "apple boughs sagged with fruit so ripe it smelled like forgiveness"). The environment actively shapes the final transformation, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("bruised twilight").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: finding ribbon → digging for root → discovering seed/note → planting → receiving answer through wind. The dominant stake (understanding why daughter left) tightens when the sprout's immediate growth forces recognition. Cost is visible in the three-year separation and the mender's acceptance of being the one who couldn't read the cracks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the deciduous vow metaphor—some things must fall for others to take root. The ending reweights all prior material when "it wasn't out of duty, but because the earth—and their daughter—had shown them how." The question "What did you see that I couldn't?" receives a non-literal answer through the wind's chorus, avoiding stated morals.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through craft metaphors (quartz-eye mender, stitching wound to wound). Controlled psychic distance shifts effectively from external observation to intimate reflection. Minor register elevation in places ("gilt," "deciduous") stays within bounds of this POV's lexicon as a skilled craftsperson.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some overwriting appears ("apple boughs sagged with fruit so ripe it smelled like forgiveness"). Template cadence emerges in the final section with repeated "The [noun]" openings. Information density is high and most lines do multiple jobs, but figurative density in places obscures rather than clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cathedral-as-orchard with the deciduous vow concept creates non-obvious meaning. The specific detail of the daughter's hair ribbon as both taunt and breadcrumb trail avoids generic parent-child conflict. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and symbolic density mostly succeeds, though occasionally tips toward overwrought.</comment>
