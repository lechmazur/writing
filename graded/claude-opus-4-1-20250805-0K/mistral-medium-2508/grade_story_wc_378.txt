<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias-7's internal conflict between preservation and necessary destruction drives a genuinely earned transformation, with the box of fears providing concrete embodiment of his contradictory impulses. The final choice to leave the dome carries visible cost through 127 years of accumulated identity. Minor deduction for the woman's backstory feeling slightly convenient as motivation catalyst.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the fire as decisive change that reconfigures Elias's relationship to containment, landing with clear cost (leaving his purpose). The box discovery triggers meaningful escalation toward the controlled burn decision. Minor weakness in the transition between fire and dawn feeling slightly compressed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dome and desert create genuine constraint that shapes Elias's final choice, with the roses' "strangely organic" quality threading through as both setting detail and thematic pressure. The magnetic shift functions as environmental timer forcing action. Spatial choreography from dome interior to airlock to open desert tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The magnetic shift creates escalating pressure that forces Elias's choice between preservation and destruction, with the fire representing genuine agency under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in burning 127 years of work and abandoning programmed purpose. The stakes deepen effectively from maintenance crisis to existential choice about containment versus freedom.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The containment/release dialectic emerges organically through concrete actions (tending roses, burning them, leaving), with the box literalizing how preservation can become imprisonment. The final image of Elias entering the desert while "the roses would bloom" achieves resonant ambiguity about cycles of constraint. Theme avoids explicit statement while remaining legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive android POV with phrases like "his metal fingers," "the static in his chest cavity," maintaining consistent perceptual signature throughout. Effective modulation during the fire sequence where syntax tightens under pressure. Minor register elevation in "miniaturized ecosystems into survival pods" that briefly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "The dome hummed like a dying bee" and effective rhythm variation. Some redundancy in the fear descriptions ("squirmed, not with malice, but with recognition") and occasional overwriting ("the friction of two truths"). Information density is high but a few passages could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The android caretaker confronting programmed limitations through a controlled burn offers fresh synthesis of familiar elements, with the box of miniaturized fears providing unexpected emotional grounding. The magnetic shift as both literal and metaphorical pull elevates the concept. Risk-taking in the lyrical android consciousness pays off (+0.3).</comment>
