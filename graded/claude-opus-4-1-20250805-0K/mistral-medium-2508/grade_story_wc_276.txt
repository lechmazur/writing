<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fisher's motivation through grief and pursuit of his daughter's voice is embodied through concrete actions (tracing grooves, driving the spike, digging) with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—holding to cool-headed discipline while feeling the pull of memory. The final renunciation ("This one, he let go") carries visible emotional cost earned through thirty years of pursuit, though some interior passages lean toward summary rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through sound-wave garden, sleepwalking constellations, and the goddess's mouth until the final letting-go reweights all prior pursuit with felt cost. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—the fisher's renunciation forecloses the path of chasing echoes, with "somewhere, in the dark between sounds, his daughter's voice finally stopped calling" marking the decisive shift. The orientation anchors (fisher, sound wave garden, night) establish by ~50 words, though the fantastical elements take longer to cohere.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden constrains choices through its grooves that "transliterate emotions" and the place "where the soil refused to hum," while the rail spike functions as both tool and repository of echoes. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (subsonic pulses, teeth in teeth, warm breath from the earth), though some descriptions drift toward the abstract ("frequencies," "echoes") without sufficient grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through pattern recognition (constellations walking again), physical excavation revealing the goddess's mouth, and the fisher's command of silence that forces resolution. The dominant stake—whether to hold or release his daughter's echo—tightens when "something else was wearing her voice," though the middle section could strengthen the cost of his thirty-year pursuit before the renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of holding versus releasing grief emerges through concrete particulars: the rail spike that "burned cold," the goddess's mouth "lined with teeth made of broken echoes," and the final distinction between "which echoes to catch and which to let drown." The ending reweights the entire pursuit without stating a moral, as his smile to the dark suggests acceptance of absence rather than resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through the fisher's attention to frequencies, vibrations, and subsonic pulses reflects his specific expertise. Prose rhythm modulates effectively from measured observation ("The fisher knelt") to urgency during excavation to the quiet finality of "He smiled. / It smiled back." No dialogue appears, maintaining the piece's commitment to silence as communication.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong moments of compression ("The garden screamed—a sound only he could hear") and varied sentence lengths create effective rhythm, though some passages contain mild redundancy ("The kind that lasted. / The kind that didn't echo."). Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs, but occasional abstract phrasing ("when patterns break themselves") and slight repetition in the final section prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of fishing imagery with sound-harvesting and the goddess who has "a mouth" rather than a body offers fresh conceptual territory. The specific detail of teeth as "smooth as river stones" in the net and the rail spike that can hold echoes transforms familiar grief narrative through non-obvious particulars, though the cosmic elements (sleepwalking constellations) feel slightly less integrated.</comment>
