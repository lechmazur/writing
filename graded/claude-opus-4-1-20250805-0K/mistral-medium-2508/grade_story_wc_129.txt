I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through layered imagery, recurring motifs, and a pattern of touches that culminate in belonging rather than through strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Reed's motivation to find connection through creation is embodied in her hands remembering marsh reeds and her carving "kin from what others discarded." The contradiction between her solitary search and communal goal creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution where Syl appears exactly when needed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through the constellation of handprints transforming the arbor from individual creation to communal artifact. The cost is legible in Reed's acceptance that "some webs were meant to be woven slowly" - releasing control for collective belonging. The accumulative pattern holds consistently through tags, touches, and grafting imagery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and Shimmer Crater create a dreamlike but coherent setting where "air hummed with the murmur of lost languages." The obsidian arbor functions as micro-setting that constrains choice - "too sharp to touch but too beautiful to ignore." Setting actively shapes the search path and final gathering.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of belonging deepens from Reed's solitary creation to collective search to communal marking. The escalation through "I was here" to "We are here" to the constellation of touches shows meaningful accumulative pressure. Cost is visible in Reed's release of individual authorship for shared creation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of kinship as active creation rather than discovery emerges beautifully through the progression from solitary carving to collective touching. "Belonging was not a place, but a current" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The final invitation from lost languages reweights the entire crater from wound to possibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with selective perception ("hands remembered...before her mind did"). The prose modulates effectively between crystalline description and embodied action. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful - "You didn't have to look"/"But we did" carries strong subtext about chosen connection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("yawned the Shimmer Crater") but mostly serves the lyric mode. Minor repetition in "Reed didn't chase" following similar phrasing, but information density remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of street art and ancient grafting rituals offers a fresh angle on community-building. The specific detail of violet paint "still faintly warm" and scars "like reed-marks" creates memorable texture. The risk of the lyric/accumulative mode pays off through coherent pattern-building.</comment>
