<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's seasonal muteness creates genuine constraint that shapes her artistic practice and communication methods. Her motivation to preserve wonder through kinetic sculpture is embodied through concrete actions—pressing ice to cheek, building with "wired bone and polished stone." The final choice to continue after the ice shatters shows earned endurance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the piece builds through sensory patterns toward the ice's shattering—a Resonant Reconfiguration where destruction becomes dissemination ("a thousand tiny bells...scattering into the sky like seeds"). Cost is legible in the dissolution and Liora's acceptance of transience. The orientation anchors arrive cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bluff functions as more than backdrop—its wind drives the sculptures, its height creates necessary isolation from the "loud and brittle" world below. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "copper chimes," "pale blue, veined with ancient light," the ice that "glistens" from within. The environment constrains choices and enables the artistic practice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pressure builds through the sculpture's acceleration and ice thinning toward inevitable shattering, with Liora's awareness creating tension ("She knew the moment it would shatter"). The dominant stake—preserving wonder in a world grown "loud and brittle"—is clear, though the escalation remains primarily textural rather than decisively causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between silence/noise, preservation/loss, with the ice fragment carrying "forgotten songs" that must be freed through destruction. The final image of Liora tuning "the world to hear" the already-written symphony resonates without stating a moral, though some passages edge toward abstraction ("Wonder wasn't gold or sapphire...").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, though occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("veined with ancient light," "flat gray of compromise"). POV remains stable with Liora's selective perception of vibration and resonance. Some filter constructions ("She knew," "Liora smiled") slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of precision ("ring of a well-struck bell," "shiver of ice against metal") but suffers from abstract passages that slow momentum ("Wonder wasn't gold or sapphire or the flat gray of compromise"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("The sculpture began to turn...the ice answered"). Information density varies, with several lines doing single duty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of a seasonally mute artist who creates sound sculptures offers a fresh angle on communication and expression. The specific synthesis of ice preservation/destruction with bell-tuning creates non-obvious resonance. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure serves the theme, though some metaphysical abstractions feel familiar.</comment>
