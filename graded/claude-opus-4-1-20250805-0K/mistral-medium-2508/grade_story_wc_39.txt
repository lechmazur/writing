<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation crystallizes through concrete embodied details—trembling hands on the rusted key, eyes burning at the girl's laughter—with contradictory impulses (hoarding vs. sharing) acting simultaneously in scene. The renunciation of isolation for connection earns its cost through prior causality, though some interiority edges toward label-speak ("gleaned redemption").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Elias accepts that "redemption wasn't in holding tight but in letting go," with visible cost in his years of isolation now reframed. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increases and the girl's arrival as pattern break, though the final paragraphs slightly over-explain the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The feral loft functions as micro-setting constraining choices—sand creeping through cracks, warped floorboards, sagging balcony all pressure Elias's fragile existence. The dunes' song captured in glass and the music box's broken mechanism directly shape the narrative's central transaction, though some descriptions ("lonesome splendor") lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving vs. sharing captured sounds) tightens when the girl's request forces Elias to choose between hoarding and passing on his collection. Cost appears in "decades of held breath" released, though escalation under the Accumulative lens could deepen further through the middle section.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the music box's stubborn note and the girl's recognition of her grandfather's song, avoiding direct statement until earned. The final image of Elias reaching for another jar while the music box plays reweights all prior collecting as preparation for sharing, though "gleaned redemption" edges toward prompt-echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature through selective detail (breath curling, brass edges dulled by salt) and controlled rhythm, though register occasionally drifts elevated ("lonesome splendor," "wistful"). The girl's dialogue feels authentic and goal-driven, creating effective contrast with Elias's more literary interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("dunes shifting like restless giants") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("positively wistful," "gleaned redemption") and mild template cadence in the resolution. Some paraphrase loops appear ("Not as a poet begging for coins, but as a keeper of the in-between") that restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound-collecting vagrant poet with broken music box creates fresh angle on memory preservation, though execution occasionally retreats to safety. The girl's arrival and her grandfather connection provides non-obvious turn, but some elements feel workshopped rather than lived.</comment>
