<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The guardian's internal state is conveyed through abstract concepts ("dimensionally homesick," "foggy lucidity") rather than embodied emotion or concrete impulses acting in scene. The transformation from melancholy to peace occurs through passive reception of whispers rather than earned struggle, and the final stance lacks visible cost—she simply "waits" without foreclosing any path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with atmospheric density building toward a state of "peace," but this Resonant Reconfiguration lacks visible cost—the guardian's "responsibility" is simply "lifted" without sacrifice or trade-off. The transformation from anxiety to understanding happens through passive revelation rather than causal pressure, and no path is foreclosed with consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The frozen garden with its mist and statues creates consistent atmosphere, and sensory details like "damp earth and decaying leaves" ground the setting. The environment shifts perception (statues transform from "macabre grins" to "serene"), but it doesn't constrain choices or charge the final image beyond mood—the guardian could reach the same peace anywhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake of "safeguarding the library's secrets" is declared but never tested through concrete pressure—no actual threat materializes. The guardian's journey from burden to peace happens without opposition or meaningful choice; she simply meditates and receives wisdom, with no tightening that forecloses options or extracts cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of knowledge boundaries ("where radiance of knowledge ended and darkness of ignorance began") emerges through the guardian's journey and the transformation of the garden's appearance. However, the resolution offers abstract comfort rather than earned wisdom—"making friends with uncertainty" arrives without dramatized struggle or specific insight that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and atmospheric word choice ("frost-rimed paths," "ethereal tentacles"). However, the perceptual signature lacks specificity—the guardian notices everything with equal poeticism rather than selective, character-driven attention, and no dialogue tests voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "mist swirled"/"mist seemed to thicken"/"mist began to clear" repeats without progression, and "foggy lucidity"/"veil of sleep" restates the same dreamlike state. Template phrasing appears in "As she walked"/"As she waited" constructions, though the atmospheric language occasionally achieves genuine texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The piece attempts a lyric meditation on knowledge and uncertainty but relies on familiar tropes (mysterious guardian, forbidden library, mystical revelation) without transformation. The concept of "interiorizing exteriors" and "dimensional homesickness" gestures toward originality but remains abstract rather than grounded in specific, lived detail.</comment>
