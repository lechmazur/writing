<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation to understand houses that "feel alive" is consistent and drives her actions, but her internal experience remains largely abstract ("sense of quiet wonder," "inexplicable connection"). The transformation from observer to ritual practitioner feels unearned—we don't see the internal struggle or contradiction that would justify this leap. Her final realization about the house as a "living, breathing entity" arrives without sufficient embodied cost or resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Eli's gradual discovery building toward understanding, but the closure lacks visible cost—her being "forever changed" is asserted rather than demonstrated through specific loss or transformation. The orris root shard's "shard of hush" property sets up expectations that don't clearly pay off in the ritual's mechanics or outcome. While a Conceptual Repricing occurs (house as living entity), the conceptual cost remains too abstract to land with force.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The quiet bay setting and perfume shop are rendered with selective detail ("soft lapping of waves," "creamy hue and intricate patterns"), and the atmosphere effectively supports the meditative tone. The orris root shard functions as micro-setting that enables Eli's ritual. However, the houses themselves—central to the story's premise—remain generic rather than specific, missing the opportunity to use environmental detail to constrain or shape Eli's choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is established early but never faces meaningful resistance or complication. Eli's ritual with displaced objects represents the story's single attempt at escalation, but it proceeds without obstacle or cost. The "hushed blaze of energy" she perceives lacks the specificity needed to register as earned discovery rather than convenient revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of hidden energies and sanctified spaces emerges through Eli's actions and the orris root's properties, avoiding direct statement. The concept of "displaced objects" sanctifying space offers intriguing thematic potential. However, the final revelation that houses are "living, breathing entities" feels unearned without concrete particulars showing what this means or costs—it remains an abstract claim rather than a resonant discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent meditative register appropriate to Eli as "creeping normality noticer," with controlled psychic distance throughout. However, the voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—Eli notices things generically ("subtle changes," "otherworldly energy") rather than through a specific lens. The perfumer's dialogue about the orris root shard carries minimal subtext, functioning as exposition rather than character-revealing action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Significant paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "sense of reverence and awe"/"with a sense of reverence," "houses that felt alive"/"essence of its aliveness," "forever changed by the experience"/"had been forever changed." Abstract descriptors proliferate without concrete specificity ("otherworldly energy," "latent energy," "hidden rhythms"). The phrase "streetlights...daydreaming with a soft, ethereal glow" strains metaphor coherence, conflating the required element with unrelated imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The concept of a "creeping normality noticer" who performs rituals with displaced objects to understand living houses offers modest originality. However, execution remains generic—the discovery that houses have "hidden rhythms and resonances" could apply to countless mystical awakening stories. The story doesn't commit fully to its premise's implications, retreating into safe abstraction rather than exploring what it specifically means for houses to be alive.</comment>
