<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The poet's internal state relies heavily on abstract telling ("furiously tranquil," "cartography of scars") without embodied contradiction in scene. The final "understanding" arrives through reading a letter rather than dramatized struggle, with no visible cost to the revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive change or reconfiguration with legible cost. The poet reads a letter and achieves "understanding," but this resolution is asserted rather than dramatized—we never see what the letter contains or how it transforms her stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The storm and observatory create atmospheric pressure, but the setting doesn't constrain choices or enable specific tactics. The darkroom timer and sealed envelope function more as props than environmental elements that shape action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding her scars—remains abstract throughout. No meaningful tightening occurs; the poet simply stands in the storm until she decides to open an envelope, with no dramatized opposition or cost to either waiting or opening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through repetitive abstract phrases ("cartography of scars," "masks slipping") that never concretize into specific experience. The final "understanding" is declared without showing what particular insight was gained or its implications.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains distance without distinctive perceptual signature. Diction drifts into elevated register ("rarefy the air," "storm-kissed wonder") that doesn't align with a specific character voice or serve pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Extensive paraphrase loops pervade the text ("cartography of scars" appears 4 times, conceptual redundancy about storms/turbulence/tempest). Template cadence runs ("The poet..." starts 8 sentences) and abstract descriptors ("otherworldly glow," "hidden patterns") replace concrete detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The concept of a poet at an observatory during a storm offers potential, but execution relies on abstract meditation rather than specific dramatic pressure. The "sealed envelope in a bus timetable" detail feels forced rather than organic to the situation.</comment>
