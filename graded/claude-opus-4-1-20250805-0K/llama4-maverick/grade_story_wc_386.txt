<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to "salvage something pure from the wreckage" remains abstract throughout, never manifesting in concrete choices with visible cost. The character exists primarily as a vehicle for atmospheric description rather than as an agent making difficult decisions under pressure. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; instead we get meditation-like observation without internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page - Aria simply "vanishes into the night" without altering her state or foreclosing any path. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but fails to achieve the required density increase or pattern break that would reweight the dominant stake. The vision sequence provides backstory about an unnamed woman but doesn't change Aria's present options or knowledge in any legible way.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (melting ice scent, candlelight on frozen surfaces) that creates atmosphere. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies resources that affect outcome - it remains scenic backdrop. The melted snow globe functions more as symbolic ornament than as a tool that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>No escalation or meaningful tightening occurs - Aria experiences visions but faces no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and pays no visible price. The dominant stake ("to salvage something pure") never faces concrete testing or complication. The vision sequence adds information but doesn't narrow options or force any choice with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "windows of connection" theme emerges through imagery but never develops through concrete events that test or complicate it. The piece gestures toward complexity ("fragments of dreams that had been lost or forgotten") but doesn't dramatize any specific moral calculus or meaningful ambiguity. The ending offers no resonant answer to any central question, merely atmospheric fade-out.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent ethereal register but lacks a distinct perceptual signature specific to Aria as an individual. No dialogue appears to evaluate. The narrative voice reads as generic mystical rather than character-particular, with phrases like "ethereal glow" and "otherworldly energy" that could belong to any supernatural story.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Pervasive template cadence ("Aria sat... She weaves... Aria's eyes were... She was searching...") creates mechanical rhythm. Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "windows of connection" / "invisible threads that bound the world together" / "network of connections." The prose prioritizes atmosphere over propulsion, with many sentences that could be removed without changing knowledge or situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The wreck-diver ghost whisperer concept offers initial promise but executes through generic mystical imagery without specific transformation. The piece reads like a standard meditation-vision template with supernatural elements that could be swapped for any mystical practice. No fresh inflection or non-obvious synthesis emerges from the familiar elements.</comment>
