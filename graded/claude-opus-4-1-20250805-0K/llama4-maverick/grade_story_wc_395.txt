<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lena's obsession and personal void create genuine motivation, but her transformation from archivist to detective feels rushed without embodied struggle. The connection to her "own lost loved ones" arrives too late and abstractly. Internal conflict exists but operates through summary ("burning need," "haunting sense") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with recurring numbers building pattern density, but closure lacks decisive cost—Lena's "transformation" and "newfound wonder" assert change without showing what she sacrifices or how her options narrow. The revelation that files are "simply archived" deflates rather than crystallizes stakes. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The archive setting with "servers and dusty hard drives" creates atmosphere and the patch functions as a concrete object, but neither constrains Lena's choices or charges the final image. Sensory detail remains primarily visual ("dimly lit," "brightly attentive eyes") without exploiting the archive's tactile or auditory potential.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Stakes around the missing employees and Project Stellar dissipate when the answer proves mundane—files weren't deleted but archived. The cryptic warning "They're watching" creates momentary tension but leads nowhere. No meaningful tightening occurs; Lena's search concludes without forcing a trade-off or visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of absence/presence emerges through the archive metaphor and Lena's personal void, with the recurring numbers serving as "ghostly signatures." However, the resolution that files are "simply archived, waiting to be rediscovered" offers comfort without complexity. The final paragraphs explicitly state theme ("mysteries that lay just beyond the edge of perception") rather than letting it emerge from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, and phrases like "echo of forgotten songs" create lyric texture. However, voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—Lena notices things generically ("rows of metadata," "deleted files") without character-specific selectivity. No dialogue appears to evaluate naturalism or subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Extensive paraphrase loops damage momentum: "searching for the truth"/"searching for a way to fill the void," "journey"/"quest," "transformed"/"new light"/"new truth"/"new purpose." Template cadence pervades ("She had been...," "She became...," "She was no longer..."). Abstract descriptors ("darker corners," "burning need," "fierce determination") replace concrete detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The corporate archive as repository of dark secrets offers mild freshness, and linking digital archaeology to personal loss shows promise. However, execution remains generic—the missing persons case, cryptic numbers, and conspiracy hints follow familiar thriller templates without specific transformation. The pat resolution undermines any risk-taking.</comment>
