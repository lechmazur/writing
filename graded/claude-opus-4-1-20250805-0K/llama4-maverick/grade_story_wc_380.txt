<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lighter's motivation to uncover deleted memories is clear and drives the journey, but the character lacks internal contradiction or embodied emotion during peak moments. The final recovery of memories lands without visible cost or struggle—the transformation happens too easily through touching the crystal. Character remains somewhat archetypal despite the unique perception ability.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain from whale beaching through coffee ground divination to memory recovery, but the closure lacks visible cost—memories simply return without price or transformation. The Accumulative/Textural lens suggested by crystalline imagery and "gleaming silence" doesn't cohere with the linear quest structure. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber creates vivid atmosphere with "glittering crystalline structures" and sensory details of "salt and damp earth," and the underground tunnels provide coherent spatial progression. Setting constrains the journey and enables the discovery. However, the harbor opening feels disconnected from the underground climax, and the whale's presence doesn't integrate with the crystalline setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering deleted memories—is signaled early but faces no meaningful opposition or tightening. The lighter follows visions without obstacles, and the resolution arrives through simple contact with the crystal. No visible price is paid for the recovered memories, undermining the stakes established by "exhume the past."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of memory recovery emerges through the pressed wildflowers and crystalline structures, but resolves too neatly when memories return intact. The ending line about "secrets to uncover" and "the journey was far from over" deflates rather than deepens the thematic question. Subtext operates weakly; the story states its meanings rather than implying them through image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate psychic distance, and perceptual details like "soft glow" and "gleaming silence" create atmosphere. However, the voice lacks distinctive texture—phrases like "deep-seated motivation" and "chain of discoveries" read as generic literary prose rather than character-specific perception. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structure and clear spatial choreography through the tunnels. However, multiple instances of telling over showing ("betrayed a sense of distraction," "serene quality") and abstract phrasing ("tangible connection to memories long forgotten") reduce immediacy. The final three paragraphs loop through variations of "mysteries still hidden" without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The concept of perceiving gravity pockets offers originality, but execution relies on familiar quest beats—mystical vision leads to underground chamber with glowing artifact. The pressed wildflowers and coffee ground divination feel ornamental rather than integral. The transformation test fails: this plot structure would work unchanged with different mystical elements.</comment>
