<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The undertaker's weariness and pull toward stillness provide consistent motivation, but his transformation from death-worker to sanctuary-keeper feels underearned given the sudden shift. The "inadvertently stubborn" trait appears as a label without dramatized cost. Internal conflict exists but remains abstract rather than embodied in specific contradictory impulses during key moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Earned Stasis closure with the undertaker finding peace as library guardian, but the journey lacks causal rigor—he descends, repairs the lens, and succeeds without meaningful obstacles. The orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. The Accumulative lens holds but the single "tightening" (lens repair activating the signal) arrives without prior pressure or earned cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The underwater library setting creates atmosphere through "labyrinthine structure," "tomes bound in material that shimmered like the moon," and "eerie stillness." The broken lens constrains the central action effectively. However, the journey and underwater navigation remain vague, missing tactile details that would ground the fantastical elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding/creating rest) is signaled early but faces no genuine opposition—the undertaker simply travels, repairs, and succeeds. The story tells us about "treacherous currents" and weeks of preparation without dramatizing actual obstacles. No meaningful tightening occurs; the resolution arrives through completion of tasks rather than tested commitment with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of stillness/rest emerges through the undertaker's journey from death-work to sanctuary-keeping, with the distress signal transforming from cry for help to invitation for rest. However, this arrives through assertion ("The distress signal, now revitalized, seemed to be drawing in the lost") rather than dramatized particulars. The ending offers thematic closure but lacks the resonant non-literal answer that would elevate it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistent distance and atmospheric tone appropriate to the contemplative subject. Some effective moments emerge ("tomes bound in material that shimmered like the moon"). However, the prose tends toward tell-mode summary ("Years passed, and the library became a haven") and lacks distinct perceptual signature that would make the undertaker's perspective memorable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive structures ("The undertaker felt," "As he," "With") and summary-heavy passages that compress years into single sentences. Key dramatic moments like the underwater descent and lens repair lack scenic detail. Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "weary"/"weariness," "stillness"/"rest"/"peace" cycle without adding pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The underwater library concept offers imaginative potential, but execution remains generic—the undertaker could be any melancholy professional, the library any mystical location. The transformation of distress signal from help-cry to rest-invitation provides the story's freshest element. Most beats follow expected patterns without specific detail that would distinguish this from template "seeker finds peace" narratives.</comment>
