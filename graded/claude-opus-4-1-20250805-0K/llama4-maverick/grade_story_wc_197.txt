<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to preserve history is declared but not embodied through concrete struggle or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The phone booth key functions as a static symbol rather than forcing meaningful choices. Her "carefully resourceful" trait is labeled but never demonstrated through specific action with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>No decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs on the page—Aria simply vanishes at dawn without altering her situation or paying visible cost. The gathering scene presents exposition about resistance but no causal linkage that narrows options or forces choice. The story reads as Accumulative/Textural but fails to achieve density increase or pattern break that would reweight the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The auric lagoon's otherworldly glow and luminescent orbs create atmospheric texture, though these details don't constrain choices. Sensory detail focuses heavily on visual ("shimmered," "silver glow," "starlight") without engaging other senses during key moments. The setting functions as backdrop rather than applying pressure to decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resisting "tyranny of indifference"—remains abstract without concrete test or opposition. No meaningful escalation occurs; the gathering proceeds without obstacles, and Aria departs without facing pressure that would narrow options. The story lacks any reversal or tightening that would force trade-offs or demonstrate cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through abstract declarations about preserving history rather than dramatized conflict—"revised histories" and "tyranny of indifference" function as labels without scene-level embodiment. The final image of Aria vanishing offers no resonant answer to the central question. Multiple instances of thematic echo appear, particularly "spirit of resistance" and explicit statements about countering indifference.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Aria notices generic details ("gentle lapping of water," "soft glow") without character-specific bias. Extended passages of abstract reflection ("a testament to the power of revised histories") replace embodied perception. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Pervasive abstract phrasing ("testament to the spirit of resistance," "tyranny of indifference," "fabric of the established order") creates distance from concrete action. Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same concepts ("resist the creeping indifference," "against the apathy," "counter the tyranny of indifference"). Template cadence appears in "She had been...But now...As she made her way" construction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The resistance-preserving-history premise follows familiar dystopian templates without transformation through specific lived detail. The phone booth key offers potential originality but functions only as static symbol. The story commits to its premise but doesn't follow implications into concrete, particular scenes that would distinguish it.</comment>
