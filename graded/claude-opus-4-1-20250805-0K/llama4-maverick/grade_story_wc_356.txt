I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through sensory detail and observation toward a resonant transformation rather than following strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lyra's olfactory sensitivity drives her perception and choices consistently, but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction during key moments. The transformation from ambitious herbalist to wisdom guardian feels earned through accumulated detail, though peak emotional states lean toward telling ("sense of serenity wash over her") rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Lyra's transformed understanding, but the cost remains abstract - we see her peace but not what she sacrificed for it. The accumulative structure coheres around the corpse flower's blooming, though the "turning of the tide's thought" mechanism feels imposed rather than organic to the world.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The treetop village setting with its "otherworldly language" of rustling leaves establishes strong atmosphere, and sensory details effectively filter through Lyra's olfactory gift. The corpse flower's scent as "wildflower hush" carrying forest essence creates vivid specificity that charges the transformation moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Stakes center on unlocking natural wisdom through the corpse flower, but pressure doesn't meaningfully tighten - Lyra tends the seed, it blooms on schedule, she gains wisdom. No obstacles complicate her path or force difficult choices; the transformation happens to her rather than through her agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of finding wisdom through patient observation emerges through Lyra's journaling and doodling practice, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the "undercurrent of wisdom" reads as conceptual abstraction rather than emerging from concrete particulars, and the vendor's explanation front-loads meaning rather than letting it accumulate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and mystical tone appropriate to the setting, though diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the very fabric of reality seemed to shift"). POV control remains stable but lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond the olfactory focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("sense of," "felt a," appears 8+ times) and abstract emotional labeling replaces concrete sensation. Template cadence runs through multiple "As she..." constructions, and the phrase "undercurrent of wisdom" repeats without variation, creating conceptual loops rather than deepening meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The corpse flower as carrier of wisdom through scent offers a specific angle, and the doodling on wrapping paper provides textural detail. However, the transformation follows predictable mystical awakening patterns without surprising inflection, and the "mysterious vendor with wise eyes" reads as stock archetype.</comment>
