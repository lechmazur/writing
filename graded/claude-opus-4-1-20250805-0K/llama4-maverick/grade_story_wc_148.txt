<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to uncover truth is established but remains abstract without concrete stakes or internal contradiction. The boy's connection to his father's legacy provides basic causality for his actions, yet lacks embodied emotion or specific cost when making choices. No visible character change or earned endurance occurs at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story establishes basic spatial movement through the prison but lacks a decisive closure unit with visible cost. The ending merely continues exploration without achieving DC, RR, or CR - "the boy felt the story unfolding" provides no legible before/after. Who/where anchors are clear but the dominant stake remains vague throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison and labyrinthine corridors create atmospheric pressure, with the lattice functioning as a recurring visual anchor. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as the boy moves through corridors to the metal door. However, the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain choices or charge the final image beyond mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake of "uncovering truth" is declared but never tested through concrete opposition or cost. No meaningful tightening occurs - the boy simply walks through corridors without escalating pressure or narrowing options. The story ends mid-exploration without any reversal or deepening that would foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The thematic concern with stories/legacy emerges through repetition but lacks concrete dramatization. The lattice and labyrinth imagery suggests interconnection without constraining action or accumulating meaning. The ending offers no resonant answer to any central question, merely continuing the established pattern of seeking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains consistency with appropriate narrative distance. However, the voice lacks distinct perceptual signature, relying on generic literary diction ("specter," "otherworldly light") without character-specific selection. Prose rhythm remains monotonous with repetitive "the boy" constructions throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Severe repetition issues: "the boy" appears 17 times, "labyrinth" variations 6 times, creating template cadence. Multiple paraphrase loops exist ("seeking answers or escape"/"seeking to uncover the truth"). The phrase "thread the labyrinth with his own story" repeats verbatim. Abstract descriptors like "weight of unknown" and "mystery and wonder" lack concrete specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting and father's legacy provide a workable frame, but execution remains generic. The story follows predictable exploration beats without transformation or risk. The "cry wolf boy's son" concept suggests potential complexity that never materializes into specific dramatic pressure.</comment>
