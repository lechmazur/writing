<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's guilt and professional tension create consistent motivation, but her internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied—she "ponders," "feels uneasy," and experiences "growing unease" without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final decision to "confront the truth" lacks earned causality since we never see her wrestle with specific competing options or pay a visible cost for her choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration—the protagonist simply decides to continue her search without any transformation of options or visible cost. The "sieved hush" concept is explained but never constrains choices or creates concrete obstacles. Most critically, the ending's "truth that was to come" promises future action rather than delivering closure on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore create atmospheric specificity, with tactile details like "driftwood carvings washed up like skeletal fingers" and sensory grounding in "salt and decay." However, the setting never constrains choice or enables tactics—the protagonist could make identical decisions anywhere. The driftwood carvings briefly charge the moment but don't alter her options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain declared rather than tested: the "weight of her latest client request" and "guilt-ridden" status never face concrete pressure that forces trade-offs. The protagonist's walk and examination of carvings doesn't escalate tension or narrow options—she simply decides to continue without encountering meaningful opposition or paying any price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "sieved hush" metaphor and tension between manufactured memories and truth-seeking offer thematic potential, but resolution comes through direct statement: "she was driven by a desire to discover the weight of the withheld truth." The driftwood carvings momentarily suggest physical manifestation of secrets but don't accumulate meaning or constrain the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency with evocative phrases like "cobalt terrace" and "melancholy haven," creating a noir-tinged atmosphere. However, interiority relies on abstract emotional labels ("guilt-ridden," "uneasy," "tempered regret") rather than embodied perception, and no dialogue tests voice distinction under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive emotional scaffolding: "melancholy haven," "mournful sigh," "growing sense of unease," "tempered regret" create synonym loops without advancing pressure. Template constructions like "She recalled...She was...She knew..." and filter-heavy passages ("she felt the weight," "seemed to be," "began to form") dull immediacy, particularly in what should be peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept of a genealogist who manufactures false memories while seeking truth offers inherent tension, and "sieved hush" as deliberate information suppression shows originality. However, execution relies on familiar noir atmospherics and the protagonist's crisis follows predictable beats without transformation—she begins uncertain and ends determined without surprising inflection.</comment>
