I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered observations and rhythmic repetition toward a resonant final image rather than causal progression.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation as a coral bleaching witness is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on abstract declarations ("periodically eternal thoughts," "deep-seated motivation") rather than embodied contradiction. The character arc attempts transformation through understanding but lacks the visceral internal conflict needed for higher bands. Her drumming practice provides concrete action but doesn't generate sufficient character-specific texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Maya's realization that "truth...was not in the maps or the data, but in the rhythms of the sea itself," but this arrives through summary rather than dramatized discovery. The accumulative structure coheres around observation and rhythm, yet the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. Who/where/when are anchored adequately early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sea monitoring station and recovering ocean create a vivid post-fossil-fuel world with strong sensory details ("golden glow," "gentle lapping"). The torn atlas page and assembled drum function as micro-settings that constrain Maya's investigation. However, the setting doesn't actively pressure choices—it serves more as atmospheric backdrop than narrative driver.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding disappearing coastal paths—is signaled early but never faces concrete pressure or test. Maya's investigation proceeds without obstacles, reversals, or meaningful tightening. The ending's "readiness to face whatever came next" suggests future stakes rather than resolving present ones with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of listening to natural rhythms versus relying on data emerges through repetition and accumulation, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, lines like "she was not just a witness...but a part of the ocean's own story" edge toward theme-summary. The drum-as-communication motif resonates but doesn't constrain choices or exact cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance and filters observations through Maya's expertise. However, the narrative voice lacks distinct texture, relying on competent but generic phrasing ("newfound sense of purpose," "spirit soar"). No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. Perceptual signature remains underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Significant repetition issues plague the prose: "Maya's thoughts" variations appear multiple times, "began to" constructions proliferate, and abstract declarations ("periodically eternal," "drifting moored") obscure meaning. Template cadence runs ("As she...Maya..." structure) and paraphrase loops (multiple restatements about hidden secrets) reduce momentum. The writing is serviceable but lacks the precision needed for publication.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The post-fossil-fuel-ban setting with recovering reefs offers a fresh ecological frame, but the execution follows predictable patterns of environmental observation leading to spiritual insight. Maya's drum-communication with sea creatures provides an original touch that isn't fully exploited. The story doesn't take risks with structure or perspective that might elevate its familiar arc.</comment>
