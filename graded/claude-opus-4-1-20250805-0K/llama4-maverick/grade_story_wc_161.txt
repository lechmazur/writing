<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Emilia's interiority remains abstract with phrases like "sense of equilibrium" and "bittersweet sensation" rather than embodied emotion. The dust-mote ritual provides a concrete action revealing character, but her motivation for maintaining false paper trails lacks clear stakes or internal contradiction acting in scene. The final "heart at peace" resolution arrives without earned struggle or visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>No decisive change occurs on the page—Emilia simply continues her established routine with pigeons and dust-watching. The piece lacks causal linkage between her paper trail fabrication and any present consequence. Orientation anchors (vintage bookshop attic, pigeon trainer) arrive promptly, but the story operates in an Accumulative mode without density increase or pattern break that would reweight stakes at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bookshop attic setting is vividly rendered with "musty scent of aged paper" and "soft glow of dusty skylights," creating atmosphere through selective sensory detail. The dust motes function as micro-setting that enables Emilia's ritual, though they don't constrain choices. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as pigeons flutter and Emilia moves through her workspace.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Emilia's need for secrecy versus connection—is declared but never tested through action or choice. No escalation occurs; she performs her daily rituals without opposition or tightening pressure. The ending shows her "ready" for future challenges rather than facing present conflict with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paper trails metaphor and preservation of "lost songs," but resolution defaults to explicit statement: "finding a way to live with the beauty and the pain of the past." The dust-mote watching creates a recurring image but doesn't accumulate meaning or constrain choice. Final paragraph moralizing ("In the stillness, Emilia found a sense of balance") replaces earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance without head-hopping, but the narrative voice lacks distinct texture, defaulting to literary commonplaces ("musty scent," "soft glow," "delicate balance"). No dialogue appears to test naturalism or subtext. Perceptual signature remains generic rather than filtered through Emilia's specific professional or emotional priorities.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing pervades: "Emilia's thoughts turned," "Emilia felt," "As Emilia watched/gazed/worked" creates template cadence. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines ("a sense of peace settling over her"/"her heart at peace"). The prose achieves basic clarity but lacks propulsion, with multiple sentences restating established information about paper trails and emotional states.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The courier pigeon trainer managing fabricated records offers mild novelty, but execution remains generic. The dust-mote meditation ritual provides a specific detail, yet the emotional arc (learning to trust again, finding balance) follows predictable templates. No surprising turns or fresh angles emerge from the established elements.</comment>
