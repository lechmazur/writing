<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aria's firefighter/arsonist's daughter duality provides clear motivation, but internal conflict remains largely abstract rather than embodied in scene. The grafting moment shows concrete action under her values, yet emotional states read as labeled ("surge of determination") rather than lived. Her relationship with fire and healing drives choices, though the "scars can sing" epiphany arrives without sufficient dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Aria moving from lagoon contemplation through a rescue call to tree-grafting, returning to peaceful resolution. However, no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs—Aria ends essentially where she began, "gracefully alert" by the water. The grafting succeeds without complication or cost; no path forecloses. Orientation anchors clearly but closure lacks the required visible price or transformed stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and volcanic beach create distinctive atmosphere, with black sand carrying both memory and healing properties that constrain Aria's worldview. Sensory details like "wet earth and new life" after rain integrate naturally with action. The lagoon bookends the piece effectively, though the fire scene location remains vague beyond the damaged tree.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The central stake—Aria proving she can heal despite her scarred heritage—never faces genuine test or opposition. The tree-grafting proceeds without obstacle, rain conveniently arrives, and no meaningful tightening occurs. Stakes remain declared ("prove that scars can sing") rather than dramatized through pressure that would force trade-offs or reveal cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The healing-from-scars theme emerges through Aria's backstory, the damaged tree, and the grafting metaphor, avoiding direct moralizing. The foreign coin and black sand accumulate symbolic weight across beats. However, the theme resolves too neatly—scars simply "sing" without exploring complexity or cost. The ending's "unyielding compassion" feels asserted rather than earned through specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Aria's interiority with controlled psychic distance. Voice modulates between contemplative lagoon moments and professional firefighter response. Some register drift occurs ("kelp-drift peace," "migrate") that doesn't align with Aria's practical perspective. Dialogue absence isn't problematic, but internal voice occasionally slips into explanatory mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose flows clearly with varied sentence structures, though several template patterns emerge: "Aria's thoughts were interrupted," "Aria's mind began to wander," "Aria's eyes fell upon" create repetitive possessive constructions. Abstract descriptors like "unyielding compassion" and "gracefully alert" recur without concrete embodiment. The piece relies heavily on "felt" constructions (felt a surge, felt a sense) rather than showing internal states through perception and action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The firefighter/arsonist's daughter premise offers inherent tension, but execution follows predictable redemption arc without complication. The grafting-as-healing metaphor, while apt, doesn't transform its familiar symbolism through specific detail. Black sand's healing properties and the wise woman's harmony advice feel borrowed rather than discovered through this particular story's logic.</comment>
