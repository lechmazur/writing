<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dresser functions more as atmospheric presence than active agent, with motivation stated rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. While the devotion to the garden is clear, internal contradiction never manifests in scene—the character remains static in their nurturing role without visible cost or struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>No decisive change occurs on page; the story ends where it began with the dresser tending the garden. The piece reads as extended description under an Accumulative lens but lacks the density increase or pattern break required for that mode's closure. Cost remains abstract ("withered," "worn") without a specific price paid or path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The garden maze setting is richly detailed with sensory specificity (scent of blooming flowers, withering blossoms) and creates atmosphere. However, the environment never constrains a choice or forces action—it exists as beautiful backdrop rather than active pressure on the dresser's decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs; the dresser continues their routine without opposition or stakes test. The stated goal "to prove that gardens know their gardeners" never faces challenge or complication. The piece maintains steady atmospheric pressure but lacks the decisive turn or deepening required even for accumulative designs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme of nurturing and reciprocal connection emerges through repetition but remains surface-level, stated in abstractions like "silent dialogue" and "bond that transcended words." The marbles-as-memories motif appears but doesn't constrain choice or charge the closure. Final paragraph moralizing ("monument to the power of dedication") replaces earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose maintains consistent third-person distance but lacks distinct perceptual signature—the dresser's way of noticing feels generic rather than character-specific. Voice modulates little under the supposed emotional peaks, maintaining steady literary register throughout without compression or urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Severe repetition issues: "withered vine dresser" appears 7 times, "garden" 30+ times, creating mechanical loops. Template cadence pervades ("The dresser would...", "As the dresser..."). Abstract descriptors like "poignant reminder" and "testament to" replace concrete imagery. Information density is low with multiple paragraphs restating the same nurturing relationship without advancement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece follows a familiar "devoted gardener finds meaning through tending" template without transformation. The measurable luck concept hints at originality but never develops beyond mention. Safe middle choices throughout—no risk in structure, perspective, or moral stance.</comment>
