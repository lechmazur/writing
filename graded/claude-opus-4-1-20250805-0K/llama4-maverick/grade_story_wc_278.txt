<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tattooist's guilt and ability to translate baby cries create an intriguing premise, but her transformation lacks embodied struggle—she simply "feels the weight of her guilt lift" without earned causality. The connection to the letter-writer feels asserted rather than dramatized through concrete choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens with "meteor hush" and atmospheric layering, but lacks a clear closure with visible cost—the tattooist "vanished into the dawn" without dramatized consequence or foreclosed path. The orientation remains vague throughout (what exactly is a "laboratory of lost sounds"?) and time-folding occurs abruptly without setup or payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The laboratory atmosphere with sandalwood, myrrh, and machinery creates effective texture, and the antique dresser functions as micro-setting that reveals the letters. However, the environment doesn't constrain choices or charge the final image—the tattooist could work anywhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract—"haunted firmware" and "dissonance of old guilt" never manifest as concrete pressure forcing difficult choices. The cord-tethering moment suggests agency but resolves too easily without cost or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of confronting past guilt through art emerges but relies on explicit statements ("by confronting it, she had begun to heal") rather than dramatized revelation. The final moralizing about "complexities of the human heart" replaces earned resonance with thesis declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent lyrical register but lacks distinct perceptual signature—descriptions feel literary-generic rather than filtered through this specific tattooist's consciousness. No dialogue appears to test character distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Pervasive abstraction weakens line-level craft: "the dissonance of old guilt," "fabric of reality grow thin," "meteor hush descend." Template phrasing appears throughout ("As she worked," "As the hours passed," "As the night wore on"). The prose prioritizes atmosphere over clarity, with mixed metaphors like tattoos "absorbing" fears while being "constellation patterns."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept of tattoos absorbing fears/desires while the artist translates baby cries offers originality, but execution relies on familiar workshop abstractions. The "haunted firmware" and time-folding elements feel grafted rather than integrated into the core premise.</comment>
