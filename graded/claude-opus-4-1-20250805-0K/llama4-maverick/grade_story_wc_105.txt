<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra's synesthetic attribute creates genuine particularity, and her pursuit of capturing "the sound of trust breaking" shows clear motivation rooted in personal loss. The crystalline breakthrough moment feels earned through her methodical work, though the emotional arithmetic around her mother's death trends toward tidy resolution rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Lyra's technical work building toward the crystalline sound's capture—a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights her grief work. The closure lands with conceptual cost ("a battered marvel") but the actual price of imprinting this sound remains abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse setting creates vivid atmosphere with shipwrecks and aurora light, while Lyra's synesthetic perception adds sensory texture ("soft blue murmur," "rusty red groan"). The ashen forge functions as more than decoration, whispering secrets that contribute to her breakthrough, though it doesn't quite constrain choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking to help trauma victims—remains largely internal with minimal escalation beyond Lyra's methodical calibration. While the crystalline sound's emergence marks a turning point, the pressure doesn't meaningfully tighten or force trade-offs; success arrives through patient accumulation rather than costly choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of healing through understanding absence emerges organically from Lyra's craft, with her synesthetic perception literalizing how trauma reshapes perception. The "battered marvel" resonates as both device and metaphor, though the ending's vision of catalytic healing trends toward therapeutic tidiness rather than embracing complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent psychic distance with controlled diction appropriate to Lyra's technical mindset ("calibrated her prototype," "crystalline note"). Her synesthetic perception creates a distinct perceptual signature, though some passages drift into explanatory register ("a sound she had been searching for years to help her clients heal").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("The sound of trust breaking" appears five times) and template constructions ("As she worked," "As the aurora danced," "As the night wore on"). Several paraphrase loops dilute momentum, particularly the redundant explanations of Lyra's synesthesia and the doubled vision statements in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synesthetic hearing aid designer concept offers genuine freshness, transforming the prompt elements into an emotionally coherent whole. The idea of "collecting absences" and weaving silence into therapeutic devices shows originality, though the execution relies on some familiar grief-work patterns.</comment>
