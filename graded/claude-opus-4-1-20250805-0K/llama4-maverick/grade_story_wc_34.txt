<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The balladeer remains largely passive, observing and creating art without internal contradiction or embodied struggle. Her motivation to "articulate unspoken needs" is declared but not dramatized through competing impulses or visible cost. The ghost entity lacks any characterization beyond atmospheric presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>No decisive change occurs on the page—the balladeer simply leaves after creating graffiti, with no visible cost or foreclosed path. The story operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode but fails to achieve density increase or pattern break that would constitute closure. The "forever changed" courtyard is asserted without showing how or at what price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The misty courtyard setting provides consistent atmosphere and the flower press bolt plate offers tactile detail. However, the environment never constrains choices or charges the final image—it remains decorative backdrop. Spatial choreography stays coherent but the mystical elements don't affect tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract—"articulating unspoken needs" and "uncovering secrets" never face concrete tests or costs. The storm intensifies but doesn't pressure decisions or narrow options. No meaningful tightening occurs; the balladeer's art creation proceeds without obstacle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Theme of communication with the ineffable emerges through the ghost-code concept but resolves into explicit statement: "testament to the power of creative expression." The final paragraph moralizes rather than allowing resonance to arise from particulars. Subtext operates minimally beyond atmospheric suggestion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains dreamy consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—"driftingly alert" appears as label without shaping how she notices. No dialogue to evaluate. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("mystical nexus," "ethereal breeze") that doesn't match the intimate POV established.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Pervasive template cadence ("As she...," "The balladeer...," repetitive paragraph openings) creates monotonous rhythm. Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same content (ghost responding through messages, articulating the unspoken). Dense figurative language in every sentence without payoff obscures rather than clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The ghost-in-code concept offers modest freshness but execution relies on mystical atmosphere clichés (mist, ozone, ancient architecture). The graffiti-as-communication angle provides some specificity but doesn't transform the ethereal encounter template. Risk-averse middle ground avoids bold choices.</comment>
