I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through layered fragments, sensory accumulation, and pattern density toward a resonant reconfiguration where the narrator dissolves into the space between stories.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's transformation from drowned-but-living to becoming "the space between stories" is earned through consistent interiority and embodied details like pocketing rumors "like smooth stones." Internal contradiction operates throughout (dead yet living, collecting what doesn't exist), though the final dissolution could use more visceral cost beyond the certificate dissolving.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from death certificate paradox through fragment collection to final dissolution into "the space between stories" - a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (loss of identity). The poison label becoming a door and then a boat provides causal linkage within the textural design. Who/where/when anchored early ("ankle-deep in brine," "port," "03:17").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shipping container labyrinth functions as both setting and metaphor, with HANjin-4732 providing specific anchor and the "corrugated iron" walls becoming "corridors of memory." Sensory details like "bitter almonds" tinting reality "sepia" and salt wind scouring "paint to raw metal" constrain perception and charge the final dissolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation operates through accumulation: from collecting fragments to the label growing warm to discovering the room of jarred sounds, each deepening the narrator's integration with erased histories. The final dissolution into "the space between stories" carries conceptual cost (identity erasure), though more visceral pressure in the middle third would strengthen the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of erased histories stored in the labyrinth, with the narrator's journey from administrative error to willing keeper of forgotten stories. The final image of "every erased history rises, wet and gleaming" offers a non-literal answer about memory and existence without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("lungs still bargaining with air," "moon's pulse") and consistent perceptual signature filtering everything through death-touched consciousness. The sepia-tinted perception and fragment-collection method create a unique narrative texture, though occasional elevated diction ("administrative typo") slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and information density, with lines like "I pocket these rumors like smooth stones, feeling their weight change" doing multiple jobs. Some abstract moments ("discovering the texture of memories") could be more concrete, but overall prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of a death certificate error creating a liminal being who collects erased histories offers fresh synthesis of familiar elements. The shipping container labyrinth as repository of forgotten stories and the poison label transforming into door then boat show imaginative specificity beyond template responses.</comment>
