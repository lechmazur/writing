I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is a **Causal** story - each beat follows because/therefore logic from Rowan's guilt through his attempt at repair to Elias's eventual acceptance. The clockwork heart serves as the physical manifestation of transforming an apology into action.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation with Rowan's guilt manifesting through physical details ("letter still burned in his pocket"). The contradiction between his role as chaplain and his betrayal of Elias creates genuine internal conflict. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("Second opinions are what separate repair from ruin") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear causal chain from guilt to action to reconciliation, with the clockwork heart serving as the mechanism for transformation. Closure lands with Earned Stasis - Elias's acceptance and the shared listening create visible cost (Rowan's tears, the finite ticking of the heart). The because/therefore logic holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The repair shop's sensory detail ("cedar shavings and old brass") and the prison chapel effectively constrain choices. The clockwork heart's physical details matter to the resolution. Slight deduction for some generic weather imagery ("storm clouds bruised the horizon").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from refused apology to active repair to tentative forgiveness. The cost is visible in Rowan's trembling hands, Elias's initial flatness, and the finite nature of the clockwork heart. One meaningful tightening occurs when Rowan presents the completed heart.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of repair versus ruin emerges through action rather than statement, with the clockwork heart literalizing transformation. Some heavy-handedness with Ms. Vale's pronouncements about light and storm clouds. The ending achieves resonance through the image of the winding-down heart.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with liturgical undertones ("vibrant hush that made every tick feel like confession"). Some filter verb accumulation and occasional register drift into overly literary territory ("aftersong of gears and forgiveness"). Dialogue carries appropriate subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure. Multiple instances of purple prose ("needle of rain pricked his cheek," "tears salt-bright") and some redundancy in thematic statements. The "vibrant hush" repetition works as pattern but other repetitions feel mechanical.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The clockwork heart as literalized metaphor for repairing harm offers a fresh angle on redemption narratives. The specific detail of the prison contraband workshop and Ms. Vale's enigmatic presence add originality, though the redemption arc itself follows familiar patterns.</comment>
