Looking at this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive (evident from the mathematical equations accumulating meaning, the dice's recurring significance, and the pattern-breaking that leads to closure), I'll evaluate each category.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's contradictory impulses—continuing to climb while knowing it's futile, marking equations as both proof and prayer—create genuine tension throughout. The final acceptance of "balanced perfectly on the edge of what almost happened" shows earned endurance with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("grim optimist") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the staircase transforms from prison to accepted reality, with the protagonist achieving Earned Stasis—continuing to walk but transformed. The mathematical proof sequence creates textural accumulation that pays off when equations literally crack reality. Cost is visible in accepting perpetual motion between "what was and what could have been."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The staircase functions as both setting and constraint, with marble that "exhaled dust of erased proofs" and cracks that smell of her perfume. The mathematical equations scratched into risers create lived-in specificity. Environment actively shapes choices when the stairs rearrange "into the exact slope of her shoulder."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: marking steps, rolling dice, writing equations that crack reality, reaching through light. Each mathematical proof deepens the stakes until the final acceptance costs the possibility of reunion. The "limit of regret as time approaches infinity" crystallizes the price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the mathematical metaphor system—love as "convergent series," regret as "integral of velocity over a closed loop." The final image of walking "balanced perfectly on the edge of what almost happened" offers a non-literal answer to whether memory can be solved. No explicit moralizing; meaning accumulates through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends mathematical precision with emotional rawness ("the sound of their tumble had been the last texture of her laughter"). Some register drift into academic terminology feels motivated by character. Occasional filter phrases ("I thought," "I told myself") slightly dull immediacy but maintain consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("each step the same cold marble") but some abstraction loops ("perpetual motion" concept repeated without variation) and occasional academic drift that dulls momentum. The mathematical language sometimes creates density without advancing action. No major artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The mathematical proof of love/regret synthesis feels fresh and inevitable. Using equations to literally crack reality and transform space shows genuine risk-taking that heightens stakes. The specific detail of the chipped three die creates memorable texture beyond generic loss narratives.</comment>
