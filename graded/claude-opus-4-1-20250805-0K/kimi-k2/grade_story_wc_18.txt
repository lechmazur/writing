<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mirror maker's internal journey from trapping dreams to understanding why they flee shows genuine transformation through embodied action (breathing method, physical interaction with the sextant). The contradiction between her need to control and growing understanding that capture means "becoming the space where it chose to rest" creates authentic tension that resolves with visible cost—she must remake her entire craft.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through breathing rhythms and glass mountain imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the mirror maker transforms from captor to welcomer of dreams. The cost is legible in "the crack she hadn't noticed growing across her own heart" and the complete reformation of her workshop practice. Minor orientation wobble with "ruined orchard district" vs later "living grove" transformation slightly dulls causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass mountains that "chimed when the wind passed through them" and later "began to sing" create a setting that actively participates in the transformation. The petrified orchard constrains movement and mirrors the protagonist's crystallized heart, while the fog boundary between waking/sleeping directly shapes the story's central tension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative breathing patterns that deepen from "deliberate stroke" to full synchronization with the moth's heartbeat, narrowing the boundary between maker and made. The cost manifests in the mirror maker having to abandon her entire previous practice, though the transformation feels slightly too smooth without sufficient resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete transformation of boundaries from walls to bridges, avoiding explicit moralizing. The sextant's evolution from measuring "dreams instead of stars" to calculating "distances between souls" provides resonant imagery, though the final paragraph edges toward over-articulation with "doors that welcomed them."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm in "crystalline leaves that had forgotten how to fall" and consistent perceptual signature focused on breath and transformation. However, register occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("different geometry," "mercury-backed glass") that strains against the intimate POV, and some filter constructions ("She understood then") dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong figurative coherence in the glass/mirror/breath pattern, but density becomes excessive with metaphors in nearly every sentence of peak beats. Template cadence appears in "She had learned... She would recreate... She found..." sequence. The prose achieves moments of crystalline precision but occasional abstraction ("boundaries between maker and made") and repetitive "began to" constructions reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of mirror-making craft with dream-catching through breath work offers a fresh angle on creator/creation dynamics. The transformation of measuring instruments from stars to souls shows genuine invention, though the resolution toward "doors that welcomed" trends toward expected rather than surprising.</comment>
