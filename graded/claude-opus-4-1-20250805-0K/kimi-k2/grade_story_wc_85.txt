I'll evaluate this literary story systematically according to the demanding standards provided.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through layered discoveries (watch hand, photograph, mother's message) that reweight Mara's understanding of her silence and guilt.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction between manufacturing false memories for others while suppressing her own truth creates genuine complexity. The progression from guilt to active choice ("I chose silence, and I can choose voice") is earned through concrete discoveries, with embodied details like "the metal vibrated against her skin like a pulse."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's final act of releasing her truth transforms her relationship to memory-making, with visible cost in acknowledging "her silence had been a choice, not a necessity." The accumulative structure builds through physical discoveries that reweight her understanding, though the very final line is incomplete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and driftwood shore function as more than setting—they constrain and enable key discoveries. Specificity excels in details like "each forged certificate carried the sieved hush of a family that never existed" and the corroded tin box, with setting actively shaping choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative deepening as each discovered object (watch hand, photograph, message) increases pressure on Mara's constructed silence. The cost is legible when she tears out and releases the page with real names, forfeiting her protective anonymity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of manufacturing memories versus confronting truth. The final image of the paper boat "carrying truth back into the current of time" offers a non-literal answer to questions of complicity and choice without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("the sieved hush of a family that never existed") and consistent POV. The perceptual signature shows Mara processing through tactile discovery, though occasional elevated diction ("quell the memories") slightly strains the register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm, but some overwriting appears ("the sieved hush deepened, a hush that was not absence of sound but absence of absolution"). The incomplete final sentence and occasional density of figurative language in high-pressure moments prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of a guilt-ridden genealogy forger confronting her own erased history offers fresh specificity. The transformation of driftwood carvings into vessels of memory and the watch hand discovery create non-obvious synthesis, though the resolution tends slightly toward expected emotional territory.</comment>
