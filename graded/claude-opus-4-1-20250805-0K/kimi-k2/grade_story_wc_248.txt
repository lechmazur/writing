<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The arsonist's internal contradiction between destroyer and preserver drives meaningful choices, particularly in the transformation from burning libraries to creating art as redemption. The final choice to become the archive's heartbeat carries visible cost (self-sacrifice) earned through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught imagery (phoenixes, volcanic metaphors) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the arsonist becomes what she destroyed. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices her freedom to become the archive's living heartbeat, with children finding warm books as proof of transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The volcanic archive beneath basalt constrains choices effectively—the arsonist must work within this buried space using specific materials (burnt tears, obsidian walls). The mirror chamber that exhales a glass key demonstrates environment actively shaping resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: phoenixes → murals → corridors → mirror chamber → key discovery, each deepening the arsonist's commitment. The cost escalates from artistic labor to complete self-sacrifice, with "one throb per story" crystallizing the price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the transformation of destruction into preservation, with the final image of warm books "smelling faintly of fire forgiven" offering a non-literal answer about redemption through sacrifice. The promise shifting from interpersonal to universal ("every future reader") reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled metaphorical density ("smoke-stained silence," "cryogenic dusk") that maintains coherence. Some register elevation in places ("palimpsest," "immolation") slightly strains the intimate POV, but the perceptual signature of reading "ash patterns of memory" is memorable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some metaphorical density approaches overwriting ("volcanic tenderness trembling in her chest like magma beneath thin crust"). Minor template cadence in middle sections ("She began...She painted...She lifted") but information density remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of library arson with volcanic preservation archive feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming the destruction/preservation binary through specific artistic redemption. The curator existing as promise rather than person represents bold risk-taking that heightens stakes (+0.4 within band).</comment>
