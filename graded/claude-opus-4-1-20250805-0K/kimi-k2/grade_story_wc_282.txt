<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to map the sensory void before language returns is clear and drives her choices throughout. The sleeper character applies immediate pressure that forces Lira to reconceptualize her role from mapper to conduit. Internal contradiction emerges when she must choose between recording and receiving, with visible cost when she surrenders her recorder. Minor deduction for the sleeper's somewhat abstract presence lacking full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered sensory mapping (violet longing, amber wonder, green ache) that reweights meaning at closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Lira transforms from mapper to voice by letting the unknown speak through her, with clear cost (surrendering her role/recorder). The fossil's dissolution into the sleeper and return "lighter now, its history rewritten" crystallizes the transformation. Minor deduction for slightly abstract conceptual framing of the sleeper's awakening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The coastal cave network functions as active constraint—narrowing tunnels force proximity with the sleeper, limestone walls hold emotional residue that Lira must read, and the cave's final spiral rearrangement enables exit. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lira's professional priorities (heat signatures, emotional colors). The fossil's bioluminescent interaction with algae and the cave's "throat of stone" create specificity. Environment directly shapes the final transformation when caves seal "like lips after a secret."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: fossil lifts and floats → cave fork forces directional choice → walls narrow to "throat of stone" → sleeper's dream reaches out first, reversing Lira's agency. The dominant stake (becoming voice of the unknown) deepens when Lira must surrender her recording role to enable transmission. Cost is visible when she steps back with "recorder silent" and accepts her redefinition. Slight deduction for the sleeper's actions remaining somewhat ethereal rather than fully embodied threat/pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the fossil's transformation from artifact to living interface, paralleling Lira's shift from documenter to medium. The final line "The voice travels forward by listening back" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the entire mapping journey. Subtext operates through the caves sealing "like lips after a secret" and the fossil returning "lighter now." The transitional object concept meaningfully shapes both plot mechanics and thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Lira's professional lens—everything filtered through heat-mapping colors and emotional temperatures. Rhythm accelerates during the dream-merge sequence with shorter, more urgent syntax. Purposeful compression in lyric passages ("cities dissolving into forests, oceans breathing fog") teaches pattern early and pays off. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in philosophical moments ("transitional object and transitional being both") that briefly exceeds POV's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"fossil floated above the hearth every solstice, spinning like a compass that refused north" establishes object, tradition, and mystical quality simultaneously. Some elevated diction in peak moments ("the unknown's voice by letting it speak through her") creates minor register drift. Template cadence appears briefly in the dream sequence listing. Overall propulsion remains strong with varied paragraph lengths creating visual rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory mapping with post-hibernation world creates non-obvious angle. The concept of emotions leaving heat signatures that can be cartographically recorded is specific and grounded. Risk-taking in the lyric dream sequence and the abstract sleeper figure heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity. The transformation of mapper to voice through surrendering agency offers genuine surprise that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
