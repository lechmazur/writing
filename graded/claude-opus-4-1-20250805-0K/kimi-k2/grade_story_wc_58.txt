I'll evaluate this literary story systematically according to the demanding editorial standards provided.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation to resurrect her sister through ritualistic writing is powerfully embodied through concrete actions—pressing the thread until warm, writing on air, following paths. Internal contradiction manifests beautifully in "rehearsing loss rather than reversing it," and the final renunciation (leaving without expectation) carries visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the traveler accepts absence while transforming grief into "lonesome splendor" carried within. Cost is legible in "the part of herself that had waited on every dock" and the physical manifestation of blue flowers that "folded into seeds." The pattern of writing-as-resurrection coheres throughout with the thread as persistent constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The garden functions as active setting that constrains and enables the ritual—"cracked marble rim," "dry fountain," paths the sister walked. Sensory hierarchy reflects the traveler's grief-focused perception: "bronze and rust" leaves as obituaries, quince scent as "explained absences." The thread's transformation of space (blue flowers, glowing path) makes setting inseparable from emotional arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative density—each written memory intensifies presence ("gold appeared," "ivy rustled with invisible envelopes") until the moth-vision crystallizes and dissolves. The dominant stake (transforming grief into acceptance) tightens as the traveler realizes she's writing her own obituary for waiting, with cost visible in the seeds "planning their own explained absence."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the geography metaphor—healing as coastline "we redraw together, even across the water." The sister's belief that "absence was a country one could sail to" reweights at closure when the traveler carries lonesome splendor "like a lantern no wind could extinguish," transforming loss into portable light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—leaves as "small, deliberate obituaries," the garden's "lonesome splendor," wind carrying "explained absences." Voice maintains lyric control under emotional pressure, with syntax reflecting the traveler's careful ritual precision. The incomplete final sentence ("she") works as purposeful elision suggesting continuation beyond the page.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"She had spent years writing obituaries for the living, practicing the geography of healing." Some mild repetition of "absence" and "presence" serves the accumulative pattern. Strong propulsion through varied syntax and strategic paragraph cuts that advance the ritual's stages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of writing obituaries for the living while they're absent offers fresh angle on grief work. The synthesis of physical thread from a dance carpet with metaphysical presence-projection creates non-obvious magic realism. Risk-taking in the incomplete ending and moth-vision pays off by suggesting continuation rather than resolution.</comment>
