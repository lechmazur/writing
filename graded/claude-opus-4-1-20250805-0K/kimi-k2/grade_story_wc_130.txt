I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lira transforms her understanding of loss from something to solve to something to walk through.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is grounded in the specific loss of her sister to a mirror, and her internal journey from trying to "solve" grief mathematically to accepting it as a corridor is earned through concrete actions with the glass eyes. The moment where she places the eyes in the peach tree and witnesses new growth demonstrates clear character evolution with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively as Lira transforms from seeking to reverse loss's equation to understanding it as "a corridor rather than a wall," with the cost visible in her acceptance of permanent separation. The accumulative structure coheres through repeated imagery (eyes, parentheses, mathematics) that reweights at closure when she keeps "the parentheses open."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cavern orchard setting directly constrains and enables Lira's ritual—the stalactite water provides the crucial "decimal point" that triggers the orchard's awakening, and the mosaic stepping stone serves as the altar for her conjuring. The calcified peach tree accepting the glass eyes and sprouting new life makes the environment essential to the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen effectively from stealing the eyes to confronting her sister's ambiguous loss, with the ritual's progression (placing eyes, water drop, tree's response, fern unfurling) creating meaningful escalation. The cost is legible when Lira accepts she cannot retrieve her sister but can transform her relationship to grief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mathematical metaphor for emotion develops organically through concrete details—parentheses of light, decimal point of water, "narrative of breakage that still held together"—culminating in the profound realization that emotion must be "walked through, step by numbered step." The final image of keeping "the parentheses open" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinctive mystical-scholarly register ("secretive conjurer," "mathematics of emotion," "calcified peach") with controlled rhythm that accelerates during the ritual sequence. The perceptual signature—seeing mathematical patterns in natural phenomena—remains consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "lantern trembling like a guilty thought" and "memories surfaced," though some passages edge toward density ("The patterns on the stone resembled wings, or perhaps parentheses enclosing an unsolved sum"). Minor template cadence appears in "She whispered...She had refused...She traced" sequence but doesn't harm closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of mathematical logic with emotional processing through a mystical ritual offers a fresh angle on grief narratives, particularly the specific detail of glass eyes from a taxidermist becoming instruments of emotional measurement. The concept of "ambiguous loss" transformed into a navigable corridor shows genuine originality.</comment>
