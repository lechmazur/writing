I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered sensory details and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's "affectionate skeptic" identity manifests through concrete actions—signing waivers while checking locks, testing banned substances while following recall notices by heart. The child-self encounter creates genuine internal tension, and the final choice to follow somatic markers despite skepticism shows earned character movement with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara accepts the somatic markers as a "compass" despite her skepticism, with the cost being her surrender of certainty. The accumulative structure coheres through sensory layering (static shock→tingling→warmth→ripples). Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some opacity around the pill's actual mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The light painting studio with fiber-optic vines becomes functional setting when it projects "glowing capillaries" that reveal spatial seams. The muscovite geode acts as both tool and constraint, drinking the dissolved pill to enable vision. The mirrored water corridor effectively externalizes internal states.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from testing a rumor to discovering systemic suppression ("scarcity, keeping the pathways dim"). The somatic markers (mother's hands, swallowed laughter) create accumulative pressure that forces Mara to choose between skepticism and following the bodily compass. Cost manifests as surrendering her protective skepticism.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between skepticism and openness, with the "willowglass hope" metaphor (flexible, bending but not breaking) elegantly capturing this duality. The revelation about artificial scarcity adds social critique without preaching. The mother's whistle about walls being surmountable resonates without becoming platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive texture through precise technical language ("fractally precise spiral," "muscovite geode sliver") balanced with embodied perception ("willowglass soft"). The shift to child-voice communication through water ripples shows controlled POV modulation. Minor register elevation in places ("stubborn tenderness I kept calling skepticism") but largely consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong sensory density and varied sentence rhythm, particularly in the somatic marker sequences. Information density is high with most lines doing double work. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("fractally precise," "somatic marker") and there's minor redundancy in the skepticism descriptions, but momentum generally sustains.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of painting telepathy pills into visibility through light and mineral substrate offers genuine novelty. The somatic markers as embodied memory navigation system feels fresh. The twist about recall being motivated by scarcity rather than safety adds unexpected depth to the premise.</comment>
