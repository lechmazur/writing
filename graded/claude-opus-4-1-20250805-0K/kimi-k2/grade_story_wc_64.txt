I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and symbolic resonance rather than strict causal chains, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Liora chooses "Tomorrow" over joining her mother.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's internal conflict between joining her mother and maintaining her duty crystallizes in concrete choices—closing the sovereign case, naming "Tomorrow," planting the lily. Her motivation builds through specific, embodied details (warm coin against palm, threads tugging sleeve) though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("intention shaped like forgiveness").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Liora's choice of "Tomorrow" forecloses the path to her mother with visible cost ("knees creaking like old hinges"). The accumulative structure coheres through the tapestry's revelation sequence, building to a crystallized moment of choice between past forgiveness and future duty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and tapestry function as active setting that constrains choice—the threads literally form a door Liora must decide whether to enter. Sensory layering ("rust and lilac, tenderly organized into layers") creates atmosphere while spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through the tapestry's revelations (mother's name → own name → blank waiting) to the appearance of the starlight door, forcing Liora's choice. The chess clock creates time pressure ("when it runs down, the dead may rise") though its mechanics could be clearer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of memory, intention, and duty without explicit moralizing. The final image of the angel holding the empty-but-full sovereign case resonates as a non-literal answer about choosing future responsibility over past reconciliation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("velveteen gloom," "blithe constancy") and consistent perceptual signature focused on texture and layers. Some moments edge toward elevated register ("taller than grief") but remain within the contemplative POV's plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("velveteen gloom" used three times, "tenderly organized" twice). Some metaphors strain ("tapestry records every intention ever buried") but momentum sustains through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cemetery-keeping with mystical revelation through the specific mechanism of the thread-tapestry that maps "uncharted echoes." The choice between past forgiveness and future duty offers a non-obvious angle on the keeper-of-the-dead trope.</comment>
