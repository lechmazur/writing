I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification**: This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases and patterns build toward a resonant reconfiguration through guerrilla gardening as response to loss.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The noticer's gift/curse of seeing disappearances creates compelling internal contradiction, and her shift from cataloguing loss to planting seeds shows earned change through concrete action. The tea house keeper functions effectively as catalyst. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "tenuous absolution" and "heuristically gentle" that briefly distances from embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where planting seeds becomes "signing a treaty with time" with visible cost ("I will forget a little, if you will grow a little"). The accumulative lens holds as disappearances build to transformation through gardening. Orientation anchors effectively by line 2, and the final shoot pushing through frost crystallizes the reconfiguration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard and vanished bakery's "rectangle of darker stone" effectively constrain and enable choices. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (cardamom/smoke, frost silvering weeds). The seeds and soil become micro-setting that charges the final image when "the first shoot pushed through the frost."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from noticing disappearances to active defiance through planting, with the dominant stake of preserving memory versus accepting loss. The bread-sharing and seed-planting deepen pressure effectively. Cost is visible in "throat tight" and the negotiation with forgetting, though middle section could tighten slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the concrete act of planting where loss occurred, avoiding abstraction. "The sacred had never been in the bakery itself but in the hands that passed bread" reweights prior material without moralizing. The seeds as "small defiances" and finding "the holy in what survives" offer resonant, non-literal answers to loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "creeping normality noticer" and "boots silent on moss that had swallowed marble." Some elevated diction ("heuristically gentle," "tenuous absolution") creates minor register drift from the otherwise grounded voice. The POV maintains consistency and the selective noticing effectively reflects character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Deductions for overwriting in places: "heuristically gentle, as if gentleness itself were a formula" feels overwrought; some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("the weight of ordinary things made sacred by loss"). Information density is mostly strong but occasional philosophical abstraction interrupts momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "creeping normality noticer" as someone who sees disappearances others miss is fresh and specific. Guerrilla gardening as response to loss transforms familiar grief narrative. The synthesis of memory, loss, and growth through literal planting avoids cliché, though some phrasing tends toward the writerly rather than surprising.</comment>
