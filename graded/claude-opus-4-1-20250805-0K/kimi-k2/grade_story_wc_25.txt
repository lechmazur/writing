<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to prove whispers travel farther than shouts drives concrete action through the labyrinth test, with the zodiac coin serving as both inheritance and guide. The final choice to whisper "remember" demonstrates earned agency with visible cost—the entire port freezes, hearing mothers' lullabies. Minor deduction for the guard/Aquarius setup that doesn't fully pay off in the confrontation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details (violet ribbons, spinning compasses, coin's heat) build toward the resonant reconfiguration where Mara's whisper transforms the entire port's soundscape. The closure lands with clear cost: workers freeze mid-shift, the labyrinth keeps her quiet signature. The magical container space stretches credibility slightly but serves the thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth of shipping containers during a geomagnetic storm creates immediate atmospheric pressure—compasses spin, radios fail, auroras stripe moonlight. The environment actively constrains choice (no radio communication) and the zodiac coin's heat/cold responses guide navigation. The container maze that defies physics integrates setting with the whisper challenge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal theory-testing to navigating an impossible space where footfalls create starlight paths. The whisper challenge ("Will you match my stride?") forces Mara to adjust her gait, with the coin's temperature providing immediate feedback. The final test at the microphone crystallizes the choice with port-wide consequences.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme emerges through concrete action: whispers carrying farther than shouts manifests literally when Mara's soft "remember" becomes a freight-train volume that makes the entire port hum. The final image of her boots ringing softly, "each step a quiet signature the labyrinth would keep," resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct voice filters the industrial setting through Mara's maintenance worker perspective—"steel cliffs," "catwalk that stitched." The prose modulates effectively from lyrical opening (violet ribbons) to the intimate whisper scene. Dialogue is minimal but effective ("Will you match my stride?"). Minor inconsistency in register when describing the container's interior physics.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong sensory writing and varied syntax create momentum, particularly in the storm opening and the starlight footfall sequence. Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. Some figurative density in places ("darkness thick as velvet," "cotton candy" for static) and occasional filter constructions ("she felt," "she saw") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of industrial setting with magical realism through the zodiac coin and whisper physics offers fresh inflection on labyrinth mythology. The specific detail of identifying people by their walking rhythm (Aquarius's limp) and the transformation of shipping containers into an impossible maze demonstrate risk-taking that heightens stakes while maintaining coherence.</comment>
