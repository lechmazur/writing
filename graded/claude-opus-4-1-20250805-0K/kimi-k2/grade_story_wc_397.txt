Looking at this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, I'll evaluate each category with precision.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered images and pattern recognition rather than causal chains, with density increasing toward the resonant ending.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's transformation from death-seeker to listener of endings shows compelling internal contradiction, with concrete embodied details like "pulse slower, dreams filled with the hush of glaciers." The old woman functions as effective secondary pressure, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("fold in patience") rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - Mara's role shifts from seeking her own ending to becoming a perpetual witness/teacher of endings, with visible cost in her commitment to "stay and listen until the last floe melts." The accumulative structure coheres well, though the orientation takes slightly long to establish the euthanasia tourism context (~150 words).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina creates genuine constraint through its precarious geography and storm cycles, with vivid sensory work ("creaked like an old accordion," "black water licked the ice"). The parasol tip functions as effective micro-setting that shapes choices, particularly in the trawling sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen effectively from personal death-seeking to understanding endings as "chord progression, patient and repeating," with the storm sequence providing meaningful pressure. The transformation is earned through accumulated imagery rather than reversal, fitting the textural lens, though the middle section could tighten slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of endings as music/listening rather than destinations, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final teaching moment with the boy creates resonant closure without stating meaning, and the "fold in patience" concept gains depth through repetition and variation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with Mara's selective attention to endings and dissolution, maintained through lyrical compression ("windborne solace," "temporary continents"). Some moments edge toward overwriting but mostly serve the accumulative design; dialogue between Mara and the old woman carries effective subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythmic control and information density, with effective variation in sentence length and structure. Minor issues with abstract phrasing ("fold in patience" repeated without full clarification) and occasional register elevation ("chord progression, patient and repeating") that slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of euthanasia tourism with disaster relief volunteering creates fresh thematic territory, exploring endings as ongoing practice rather than singular events. The parasol tip as conductor's baton/listening device shows genuine ingenuity, and the risk of the incomplete ending ("taught him") works purposefully.</comment>
