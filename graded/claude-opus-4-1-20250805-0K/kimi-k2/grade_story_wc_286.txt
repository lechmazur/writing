<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kiran's meditation-as-action characterization works well, with his choice to "follow the blooming over the char" creating genuine stakes. The internal consistency holds as he navigates fractured timelines through embodied perception rather than abstract philosophy. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution where kindness alone seems to heal the wasteland.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered timeline imagery until the final "petal by petal" closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost—Kiran must continuously choose between realities, understanding that "resistance to change is not stillness but continuous, careful turning." The who/where/when anchors establish clearly in the opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The oasis setting actively constrains choice—Kiran must "choose which moment to weight with his foot: the blooming or the char." The fractured timelines create a lived-in environment where "wild lavender still clung to the cracked hives" exists simultaneously with "wind scoured the combs to dust." The lantern glass transformation into "petals of light" charges the final image powerfully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Kiran moves deeper into the oasis, with each choice between timelines carrying increasing weight. The lantern's response—brightening for blooming, dimming for char—creates tangible stakes. The cost becomes explicit when "Cracks widened, but instead of shattering, the glass unfolded," showing transformation requires accepting fracture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of pottery—"continuous, careful turning, like clay centered on a wheel"—rather than abstract statements about time or kindness. The final image of the oasis as "a hidden kiln firing every possible future at once" resonantly reweights all prior timeline imagery without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—"thrum answered, guiding him deeper" and "feeling wax soften on his skin." The prose modulates effectively between meditative observation and sensory immersion. Minor register elevation in places ("phototropic to kindness itself") that slightly exceeds the zen potter's expected lexicon but serves the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Some overwriting in figurative density—"spider silk," "wax ghosts," "overlapping bowls on a wheel" cluster without always advancing pressure. The "phototropic" repetition works as taught pattern. Minor scaffold in "understood then" and "understanding that" constructions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fractured timeline concept offers genuine freshness—not just time travel but simultaneous realities requiring active choice. The synthesis of pottery craft with temporal philosophy feels organic. The specific detail of bees "stitching the sky with new flight paths" transforms the expected restoration narrative into something more nuanced about continuous choosing.</comment>
