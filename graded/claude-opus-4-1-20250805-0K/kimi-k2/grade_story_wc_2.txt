<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to "befriend uncertainty" drives meaningful choices through handling the compass rose and descending through the trapdoor, with the final renunciation of traditional timekeeping showing genuine cost. The internal progression from repairing certainty to embracing provisional navigation is earned through concrete discoveries. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("uncertainly certain") that occasionally replaces embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern recognition ("coincidence becomes pattern") drives the descent and discovery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elian transforms his practice from restoring certainty to calibrating uncertainty. The cost is visible in clients accepting backward-running clocks and Elian's contentment to "live in the pause between ticks." Slight deduction for the admiral's backstory section feeling somewhat detached from present pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse's swirling leaves and subterranean waterfall create vivid sensory anchors that constrain choices—the trapdoor only appears through pattern recognition, the compass points downward toward water. The petrified wood staircase and preserved cabin with "candles unburned" effectively mirror the time-suspension theme. Minor deduction for some abstract descriptors ("coincidence became pattern") that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: three clocks stopping at 11:17, the compass spinning then pointing downward, the lake parting to reveal deeper descent. The dominant stake—whether to embrace uncertainty over certainty—tightens when Elian chooses to descend and transform his practice, with visible cost in letting clients' clocks run backward. The pressure coheres but could intensify more sharply at the crucial descent moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between broken clocks seeking certainty and navigation requiring improvisation "beneath the ashes." The admiral's choice to sail beneath rather than burn resonates through Elian's transformation of his practice. The final image of the compass "never settling" while Elian smiles crystallizes the theme without stating it. Slight deduction for one instance of near-explicit thematic statement in the admiral's writing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with purposeful compression ("uncertainly certain") and controlled rhythm that modulates with discovery moments. The perceptual signature shows in details like "a rag that smelled of oil and regret" and the greenhouse exhaling "like dry bones." Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("provisional dreams") that slightly exceeds the tinkerer's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful imagery like "leaves turned like pages" that do multiple jobs. Information density is high with lines advancing both plot and atmosphere. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("coincidence became pattern" appears twice) and some elevated diction in peak moments ("provisional dreams," "calibrated their stopped timepieces") that creates mild register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of broken-clock repair with navigation uncertainty offers a fresh angle on time and direction. The specific detail of clocks running backward as a form of healing and the compass that "never settles" as contentment transform familiar elements. The risk of embracing lyrical accumulation over linear causality pays off in the resonant final image.</comment>
