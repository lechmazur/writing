I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor for a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered images and symbolic accumulation rather than strict causality, with density increasing toward the closure where the embryo's unsealing reweights all prior material.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lila's progression from insurgent to tradition-keeper shows clear internal contradiction between preserving the hidden bullet and embracing plant-speech wisdom. The final choice to unseal the embryo carries visible communal cost. Minor deduction for the youngest mason's slightly convenient articulation at the peak moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where unsealing the embryo creates "deliberate becoming" with visible cost (yearly negotiation replacing certainty). The accumulative lens holds throughout with increasing symbolic density. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3. Minor friction: the embryo's implanted thoughts feel slightly convenient despite being earned by the plant-speech logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The volcanic springs constrain choices (scalding water requires fern protection) and charge the final image (springs glowing, fissures closing). Sensory hierarchy reflects Lila's insurgent past filtered through current reconstruction. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from pools to obsidian shelf to communal hearth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: whispers→kite message→finding embryo→proposing new tradition→elder resistance→actual unsealing. The youngest mason's support provides the tipping point. Cost is legible (abandoning sealed certainty for annual negotiation), though the opposition could be more forceful.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of "destiny as living negotiation" emerges organically through the embryo's nature and Lila's carved bullet. The final bell image that rings of "deliberate becoming" rather than victory/surrender resonantly answers the central question without moralizing. Strong integration of reconstruction metaphor with personal and communal healing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through plant-speech and insurgent history coloring observations. Dialogue carries subtext effectively (mason's "If destiny can evolve, so can we"). Minor friction in the embryo's thought-transmission sequence where register briefly elevates beyond established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("ancestral breath," "chlorophyll courage"). Information density high throughout. Deductions for filter-verb clustering in the embryo-thoughts sequence ("felt," "feeling," "hearing") and slight register drift in "living negotiation between memory and possibility."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-war reconstruction with biological futurity through the amber embryo concept. The plant-telepathy as war trauma/gift shows originality. The yearly unsealing tradition transforms expected resolution patterns. Specific details (carved bullet, ash-colored thread) avoid generic post-conflict narrative.</comment>
