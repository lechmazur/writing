I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards for literary publishability.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through density of sensory detail, mathematical metaphors, and pattern shifts that reweight trauma into integration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's trauma responses are viscerally embodied through proprioceptive mapping and specific physical memories ("left meant waterboarding, right meant voltage"). The progression from involuntary trauma responses to deliberate grounding shows genuine psychological complexity. Internal contradictions manifest in scene as his body locks into remembered positions while his mind fights for control.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from disorientation through mathematical pattern-finding to integration, with the pewter strap's burial marking decisive change. The cost is legible in "every scream absorbed, every volt reabsorbed into the larger equation of living." The forest-as-nervous-system revelation deepens rather than explains, maintaining the textural lens throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest functions as externalized nervous system, with bioluminescent responses that mirror and constrain Kael's movements. Sensory detail is extraordinary - "moss that glowed cobalt under unseen stars," colors shifting from ultraviolet through violet to "a color he had no name for." The setting literally reshapes based on trauma patterns, making environment inseparable from character state.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the strap's tightening/loosening as Kael navigates both physical forest and psychological terrain. The Fibonacci sequence discovery provides meaningful deepening that changes his tactical approach. Cost accumulates through each wrong step until the final integration, though the resolution's ease slightly reduces tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mathematics of mercy theme emerges organically through counting heartbeats, graphing pain slopes, and discovering the Fibonacci pattern of healing. The final insight that mercy is "not subtraction but integration" reweights all prior mathematical metaphors. Subtext operates through the forest's responses and the strap's varying pressure without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice merges clinical precision ("proprioceptively enhanced nerves") with lyrical description ("orchid-blue ferns unfurled"). The mathematical register feels authentic to a torture survivor seeking control through quantification. Perceptual signature is consistent - everything filtered through embodied trauma responses and mathematical frameworks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose maintains high density with lines doing multiple jobs - "The pewter strap vibrated, resonating with the forest's hum, turning his skull into a tuning fork for mercy." Some metaphor density in middle sections approaches oversaturation ("logarithmic spiral," "data points," "diminishing pain") but syntax varies effectively and momentum never stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The forest-as-projected-nervous-system concept is genuinely original, as is the mathematical approach to processing torture trauma. The Fibonacci healing sequence and "tuning fork for mercy" show inventive synthesis. Risk-taking in the surreal setting and abstract resolution pays off through maintained specificity.</comment>
