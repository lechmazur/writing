<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to collect petrichor as "her only inheritance" drives consistent choices through psychometry gift and the decision to descend despite warnings. Her final choice to clip the compass and rise rather than push through shows earned renunciation with visible cost ("lungs aching in that luxurious way"). Internal conflict between curiosity and preservation plays out concretely in the hovering moment at the membrane.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and images build toward Elara's Earned Stasis—refusing to cross the membrane while gifting the compass upward. The closure lands with felt cost in "lungs aching" and "heart forgiving itself," making the before/after legible. Who/where/when anchored early ("factory shut down on a Tuesday," "sub-basements").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lagoon's physical properties—"water black and glossy," the membrane "breathing her curiosity inward"—directly constrain Elara's final choice at the threshold. Sensory hierarchy reflects her gift: "moss glowed," "resonance cooler than regret," building to the inverted sky discovery. The environment literally shapes the ending as she must physically rise from water.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres through deepening discovery: finding compass → psychometric reading → descent to membrane → hovering at threshold. The tightening occurs when "the hinge in her chest swung open wide enough to admit the surveyor's final silence," forcing her renunciation. Cost is visible in physical strain and the conscious choice to turn back.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete journey toward "where explanations fail," with the compass tracking "longing rather than latitude." The final image of Elara walking with "newly hinged heart" while "petals of afternoon rain are already rehearsing their descent" offers a non-literal answer about accepting mystery. The "hinged" motif recurs meaningfully throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "Tuesday that tasted of rust" and seeing moss as "pale constellations." Voice maintains lyric compression consistently ("petrichor was her only inheritance"). Psychic distance shifts purposefully at the membrane moment, drawing close for the hovering decision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density high with lines like "rope over her shoulder ticking like a cooling engine." Some figurative density in peak beats ("hinged open," "swung open," "newly hinged") creates mild repetition. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, though occasional abstraction ("where explanations wash their hands of themselves") slightly dulls clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of industrial decay with mystical discovery through petrichor collection feels fresh. The compass that "tracked longing rather than latitude" transforms the lost expedition trope. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and ambiguous ending heightens stakes without losing coherence.</comment>
