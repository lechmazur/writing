<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mourning jewelry maker's grief-driven transformation from loss to cultivation is earned through concrete particulars—jet beads becoming mulch, the unfinished locket planted as seed. Her internal contradiction between holding on and letting go plays out through physical actions (polishing lenses, folding cranes) rather than declaration. The final choice to become "gardener of the possible" carries visible cost: she releases the child's lock of hair, accepting separation to enable growth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered imagery (cranes, coordinates, garden) that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where grief transforms into cultivation. The closure lands with clear cost: "locket empty, hands full of seeds" crystallizes the trade-off between mourning and renewal. The brass caretaker's wind-down and transformation into a final crane adds a secondary layer of loss that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The observatory functions as more than backdrop—its dome "like a pupil dilated by grief," the curtains of intention that project coordinates, the marble floor where garden scents rise. These environmental elements constrain and enable choices: the telescope becomes trellis, the refractor receives the tattoo stencil, the space itself transforms into overlapping garden. The night-blooming cereus etched into sky charges the final image of darkness learning to bloom.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through the maker's nightly rituals (polishing, cataloguing, folding) until the caretaker's single utterance triggers escalation: she pricks the cereus into the sky, which cascades into garden manifestation and daughter apparition. The dominant stake—whether withering can be taught to bloom—faces its test when she must choose between keeping the locket or planting it. Cost is visible: years pass, the caretaker winds down, but she continues teaching others through "subdued ardor."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The central metaphor of cultivation emerges through concrete particulars: jet mourning beads become mulch, origami cranes carry garden coordinates, the lock of hair transforms to "root and stem at once." The story resists easy resolution—grief doesn't disappear but becomes "a lens through which the world could be focused into something bearable." The final lesson, "To mourn is to cultivate; to remember is to illuminate," arises from dramatized transformation rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm: "Night after night she polished lenses, catalogued nebulae, and folded paper into cranes." Compression serves the accumulative mode—years collapse into key images without losing coherence. The perceptual signature is distinct: astronomical and horticultural vocabularies interweave naturally ("blossoms opening in the shape of spiral galaxies"). Minor weakness: the caretaker's dialogue borders on abstract pronouncement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "jet beads and empty of hope" links physical and emotional weight. Syntax varies purposefully, from short declarations ("Morning came") to complex accumulations. Some figurative density in places ("curtains of intention," "withering she meant to teach to bloom") occasionally obscures immediate sense. The template phrase "she + verb" appears in clusters but doesn't dominate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of mourning jewelry craft with astronomical observation creates a non-obvious frame for grief work. The "genuinely artificial intelligence shaped like an astrolabe with soft brass wings" defies expectation while serving the story's logic. The transformation of traditional mourning objects (jet beads, hair locket) into cultivation tools shows genuine reimagining. Risk-taking in the overlapping garden-observatory space and daughter apparition heightens stakes without breaking coherence.</comment>
