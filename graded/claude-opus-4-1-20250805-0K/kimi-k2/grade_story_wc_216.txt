I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to understand time's texture through her grandmother's ashes creates compelling internal tension, with embodied emotional states ("texture" as velvet/broken glass, crying from "exquisite ache"). The final convergence with the elderly woman lands with earned resonance, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("secret currency to spend on moments").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the protagonist gains understanding of time's textures through embodied memory, meeting someone who "remembers tomorrow." The urn fragment's fusion with the gear creates a "compass pointing toward the next moment worth living," with clear emotional cost paid through grief and recognition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The emerald silo with its verdigris scales, bullet holes from Resource Riots, and migrating swallows repainted as equations creates vivid atmosphere that constrains movement (spiral staircase where "each step a different decade"). Sensory hierarchy reflects the POV's temporal obsession, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("greenish light fell through bullet holes").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through textural accumulation—from holding the fragment to climbing temporal stairs to breaking the snow globe, each action deepening understanding with cost. The protagonist's agency drives discovery, though the elderly woman's appearance feels slightly convenient despite the paper airplane's causal link.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through concrete textures rather than abstraction—"silk: hospital curtains," "gravel: driveway," "honey: slow afternoon." The final image of feeling "future arrive as velvet" while touching walls that vibrate with migrating swallows reweights all prior temporal exploration without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("borrowed-time timekeeper," "duration as texture") and consistent POV that filters everything through temporal perception. The prose modulates effectively from contemplative to urgent, though occasional phrases drift toward purple ("exquisite ache of recognizing time's fingerprints").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic variation and purposeful compression, but several instances of overwriting harm momentum: "exquisite ache of recognizing time's fingerprints," "secret currency to spend on moments that still needed believing." Some metaphor density in peak beats without clear payoff ("needle pointed not north but toward the next moment worth living").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of time losing numerical meaning while retaining texture is genuinely fresh, executed through specific sensory memories tied to personal history. The fusion of urn fragment with gear creating a temporal compass, plus the elderly woman who "remembers tomorrow," elevates beyond typical time-manipulation stories through emotional specificity.</comment>
