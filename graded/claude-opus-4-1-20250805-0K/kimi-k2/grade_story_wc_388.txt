<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as a "conspiracy debunker" who must confront uncomfortable truths about her father's betrayal. The internal conflict between revealing truth (tearing "fragile peace stitched from lies") versus protecting the living crystallizes in her final choice to plant the Apple. Her micro-choices—gathering shredded letters, folding the paper compass, choosing to plant rather than expose—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern breaks that reweight meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Lina plants the Apple with the paper compass, crystallizing her choice between truth and protection with clear cost: "Some truths, she knew, would rather become trees and bear bitter fruit than become headlines and bear more graves." The wasteland orchard "quietly compassed itself" creates a before/after where memory preservation replaces immediate revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The radioactive orchard setting constrains choices through the dosimeter check and "grey radioactive dust," while the stillpoint location enables the reassembly work. Sensory details are selective and purposeful—"smelling of iodine and cinnamon," "translucent quartz"—filtered through Lina's investigative priorities. The environment actively participates in the ending when "the wasteland orchard quietly compassed itself, preparing its eventual harvest.'"</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to expose genocidal truth or protect the living—is signaled early and tightens when Lina discovers her father's betrayal. Escalation occurs through accumulation: courier's death → Apple discovery → letter reassembly → father's complicity → final choice. The cost is legible when she walks away "with empty pockets yet carrying a sharper gaze," having foreclosed the path of immediate revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central tension between truth and protection without moralizing. The Diamond Apple as "living quartz containing irradiated seeds capable of germinating human memory" creates a non-literal answer to whether some truths should remain buried. The final image of the orchard "preparing its eventual harvest of memory for the season after storms" offers resonant ambiguity about delayed justice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent distance with selective perception fitting a "sharply observant conspiracy debunker." Prose modulates effectively—clinical when examining evidence ("ribbons of shredded letters, sliced by some official hand"), more lyrical at the stillpoint. Some register elevation occurs ("cynical monuments," "excavate truth") but remains within bounds for this character type.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments like "a curve that wants another curve, a serif reaching for the serif it lost" but suffers from occasional overwriting. Mixed metaphors appear ("feathery strip," "excavate truth," "stitched from lies") and some template phrasing emerges ("She walked...She pocketed...She gathered"). Information density is generally high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, though some descriptive passages could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of memory-storing trees fed by mass graves offers a fresh synthesis of sci-fi and historical trauma. The specific transformation—making the Apple both evidence and seed, creating a "paper compass" as fuse—feels earned and non-obvious. The choice to let truths "become trees and bear bitter fruit" rather than headlines presents an original moral calculus.</comment>
