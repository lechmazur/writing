I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds density through pattern accumulation and sensory layering, with the final surrender/merger serving as a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's progression from architect to integrated component is earned through concrete embodied details like "palms tingled with rational enchantment" and the visceral sinew threading. The contradictory impulses of control versus surrender play out through action, though the final merger could use sharper cost articulation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Mara becoming "the seam" between illusion and reality, though the cost feels more conceptual than visceral. The accumulative structure coheres well with each weaving action building toward inevitable integration. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gallery functions as both setting and antagonist, with specific constraints like "walls themselves seemed to breathe" and "corridor elongated into Möbius infinity" directly shaping Mara's tactics. The sinew thread acts as micro-setting, constraining every choice through its "realistically imaginary" properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative density as Mara's weavings intensify from stitching melodies to creating neural nets, with the gallery's responsive hunger forcing her final surrender. The cost crystallizes when "she began to weave herself into the unsettling calm, sinew threading through her own veins."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of connection requiring surrender emerges organically through concrete actions rather than statement. The final image of Mara as eternal mediator reweights all prior weaving acts as steps toward inevitable integration, though "texture of connection" appears too explicitly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature maintains through stress with phrases like "memories altered the air" and "rational enchantment." The voice modulates effectively from controlled observation to fevered integration, maintaining coherence even as Mara's boundaries dissolve.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity, but repetitive structures appear ("Mara nodded," "Mara watched," "Mara felt") and some filter verbs cluster in high-pressure moments. The unfinished final sentence reads as intentional but may frustrate rather than resonate. Information density remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of a living gallery that feeds on architects transforms the haunted-place trope through specific mechanics of sinew-weaving and memory-alteration. The "realistically imaginary" thread harvested from nightmares offers genuine freshness, though the sacrifice-for-peace ending trends familiar.</comment>
