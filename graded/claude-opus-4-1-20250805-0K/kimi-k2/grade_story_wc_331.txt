I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor for a prestigious literary publication.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through density of imagery and pattern, with the hyperbolic geometry shift and copper book discovery serving as cadence breaks that reweight the library's nature.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mireille's characterization achieves specificity through her memorized avoidance of creaks and "sanely eccentric" gait, with clear motivation to find "where stories live when no one is reading them aloud." The final choice to shelve the copper book and continue her patrol shows earned renunciation with visible cost (the library's transformation). Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("provisionally, and with a map folded in a pocket") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the library transforms from passive repository to active voice-holder, with clear cost in Mireille's new burden ("feeling its new weight of voices"). The accumulative lens holds as geometric distortion and sensory details build to the copper book discovery. Orientation anchors (3:17 a.m., scientific poetry library, Mireille) land within first 50 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library's hyperbolic transformation constrains Mireille's path ("stepped off the Euclidean plane"), while specific details like "hot toner and cold starlight" and the doctoral student's "drool pooling into a perfect Möbius strip" create lived-in texture. The copper scarf actively guides choice by "tightening as if a gentle hand were leading her." Setting directly shapes the closure through geometric restoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes emerge through library's geometric transformation creating pressure that Mireille must navigate, with escalation via the scarf's increasing tension leading to the copper book discovery. The cost lands clearly (library permanently altered, new responsibility accepted). One meaningful deepening sufficient at this length, though the conflict could use slightly more resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the concrete discovery that stories live "in the charged interval between reader and read, where geometry forgets to be straight." The final image of Mireille as "guardian of the hour when solitude is observed most keenly" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Analog memories concept integrates perfectly with the physical/metaphysical boundary exploration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice through inventive compounds ("odd-hour librarian," "analog memories") and controlled rhythm that modulates with the geometric shift. Perceptual signature strong in selective noticing (creaks, scarf weight, light color shifts). Minor filter verb cluster ("Mireille felt," "She was not shelving") in early sections prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("equations unfolded into narratives: a love letter written in the spectral lines of hydrogen"). Some elevated diction risks register drift ("provisionally," "hyperbolic geometry") but stays mostly within experimental science-poetry fusion. Minor paraphrase loop with "stories live" concept stated twice in similar terms.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-living-organism with mathematical precision creates non-obvious angle. The hyperbolic geometry transformation and copper book as story-awakener show bold risk-taking that heightens stakes. Specific details like "analog memories" and "sonnet voltage" avoid generic library tropes while the transformation feels earned through established patterns.</comment>
