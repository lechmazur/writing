I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through encounters that deepen the pendant's resonance until the final transformation where Mira accepts her new role as bearer of wonder.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's transformation from anxious courier seeking mentor approval to bearer of wonder is earned through accumulating encounters. Her jittery physicality ("bootsoles jittered," "knees clicked with nerves") embodies her initial state authentically, and the final choice to hook rather than surrender the pendant shows agency with clear cost—losing her mentor but gaining purpose.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: Mira's role transforms from courier to "bearer of perpetual invitation" with the cost of accepting her mentor's absence into myth. The accumulative structure builds through tollkeeper and stargazer encounters toward this crystallization. Minor orientation wobble early (the ridgeway's geography) but recovers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway and pendant's "dragonfly-wing" crystalline structure constrain choices effectively—the cliff face forces the final meeting, the pendant's vibration shapes each encounter. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("green and violet light," "reindeer gut"). The environment actively participates in the story's transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: each encounter extends from "short seconds" to "minutes dense as amber," building pressure toward Mira's final choice. The cost is legible—accepting perpetual invitation means releasing her need for mentor approval. The pendant's sympathetic vibration creates coherent pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the pendant's effect: wonder as something that must be "coaxed, like tending a dormant seed." The final image of divergent women with "mirrored signals" resonantly answers how personal stories become collective myth without stating a moral. The fade from memory to myth is earned through concrete encounters.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Mira's nervous physicality and musical attention ("pulse," "rhythm," "hum"). Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("minutes dense as amber") slightly exceeds the courier's likely lexicon but serves the accumulative design. Dialogue is minimal but effective when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations matching emotional beats. Some density issues: "the aurora folded backward into first light, memory and myth braided inseparably" compresses too much. Occasional elevated diction ("germinate," "sympathetic vibration") serves theme but occasionally slows momentum. Information density is high without becoming opaque.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courier narrative with myth-making process—the pendant as conductor of wonder that transforms brief encounters. The specific detail of "reindeer gut for luck" and mother vanishing "into a map of constellations" creates particularity. The concept of wonder needing to be coaxed rather than descending offers genuine insight.</comment>
