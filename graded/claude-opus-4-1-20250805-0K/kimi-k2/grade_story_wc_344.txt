<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The locksmith's transformation from repairer to mechanism shows clear internal contradiction ("felt the brass key at her throat fuse to her skin"). Her motivation to "fix what the sky had broken" drives every choice through to her acceptance of becoming the lock itself, with visible cost in her final integration into the machinery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the locksmith becomes part of the mechanism she sought to repair, with clear cost ("felt her joints click into the grand mechanism"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through moonscript → gears → mirrors → final fusion. "When the last gear turns, the locksmith becomes the lock" crystallizes the transformation with felt sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The frozen library's physical constraints shape every action—frost that "rang like crystal bells," mirrors "leaking daylight like blood," and most critically, the cracked mirror that becomes the portal for repair. The setting isn't decorative but actively channels the locksmith's choices, particularly when "the hall of mirrors became a single window."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from searching for prophecy scraps to confronting the broken world ("continents stuttering, oceans skipping tides") to the final sacrifice of self-integration. The rhythm of repair (tick, pause, mend, release) provides clear escalation structure with visible cost when she "felt the brass key at her throat fuse to her skin."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of repair requiring the repairer to become part of the broken system. The "rhythm of repair" motif gains weight through action rather than statement, culminating in "the locksmith becomes the lock" without moralizing. The driftwood nostalgia for "beaches she had never walked" adds poignant specificity to the sacrifice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with consistent lyric register ("shard of driftglass caught in starlight") and controlled perceptual signature focused on mechanical/celestial fusion. The prose modulates effectively from contemplative searching to urgent repair to accepting transformation, maintaining clarity through the experimental elements.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong figurative control and information density, though occasional overwriting appears ("floored with frost that rang like crystal bells"). Some template cadence in the mirror sequence ("She saw...She saw") but the prose achieves genuine momentum through the repair sequence. The final paragraph's rhythm effectively supports the transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of a locksmith who becomes the lock itself offers genuine freshness, executed through specific world-building (sky-whales, eclipse-light, petrified tears). The "rhythm of repair" as both method and fate transforms the familiar hero's journey into something memorably specific. Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
