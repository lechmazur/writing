I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered images and metaphorical density toward a resonant reconfiguration where the narrator joins the conversation with the city's architecture.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The widow and narrator develop through concrete micro-choices (pressing seal to wall, teaching lessons, sharing tea) with embodied contradictions visible in "I laughed, but the sound felt rehearsed." The final acceptance of being "spoken through" by buildings represents earned transformation with clear cost—accepting the dead tutor's role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from seal arrival through weekly lessons to final integration, with the Resonant Reconfiguration landing powerfully when narrator accepts being "spoken through" and receives the city's morse-code welcome. The cost is legible—accepting a ghostly inheritance and changed identity—though the precise mechanics of "interrogation" remain slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting functions as active participant: brick vibrates heartbeats, cornices flex like eyebrows, drainpipes whisper gossip. The rooftop garden with verbena in tin cans and meteor shower creates vivid micro-setting that directly enables the final transformation when narrator presses branded chest to parapet.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from curiosity about dead mail to learning architectural language to accepting spectral inheritance. The widow's lessons create escalating pressure through seal-pressing, wall-listening, and final branding that forces the narrator's choice to join the conversation, with visible cost in accepting this haunted role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "agreed upon lies" that become the language of old buildings—"mostly made of agreed upon lies that have outlasted the liars." The final image of the seal as "period at the end of an unfinished clause" offers resonant non-literal answer about how meaning persists beyond death.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains lyrical precision throughout ("padded envelope addressed to no one living," "empty cup like a question mark"). Perceptual signature strong in how narrator notices architectural details as language, though occasional elevation ("seismic Morse") slightly exceeds established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("She smiled the way people smile when the answer is older than language"). Some metaphorical density in peak moments ("meteors spelled sentences across the dark") but pattern is taught early and pays off at closure with architectural conversation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story with linguistics creates non-obvious angle on inheritance and communication. The concept of buildings having grammar and dead language tutors teaching through architecture feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold risk in the spectral elements heightening rather than obscuring stakes.</comment>
