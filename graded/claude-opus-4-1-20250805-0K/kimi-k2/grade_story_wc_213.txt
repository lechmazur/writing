<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tester's motivation to "favor listening over noise" drives consistent choices through pulling the bell, calibrating the sky, and accepting the teaching role. Internal experience differs from external calm through embodied details like "feeling the weight of weather sleeping inside the bronze." The final acceptance of responsibility shows earned change with visible cost ("weight settle like responsibility"), though some interior passages lean toward abstract rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from "solstice hush" through instrumental readings to the bell's "oceanic note" that reconfigures the sanctuary's purpose. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the tester accepts the rope and teaching role, with cost visible in "weight settle like responsibility" and the year-long commitment ahead. The piece teaches its pattern of silence/listening early and pays it off when "the mountain's weather restored to equilibrium."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sanctuary's physical properties—"resonant cavity," bell as "tuning fork"—constrain the central action and enable the weather calibration. Sensory hierarchy reflects the tester's expertise through precise instrument readings ("pressure flatlined, humidity a held breath"). The recurring "solstice hush" evolves from environmental descriptor to internalized state ("private zero hour inside his chest"), though some passages drift toward abstract rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity about the summons through the weight of the bell rope to accepting year-long responsibility for teaching another. The "zero hour" timing creates genuine pressure that narrows options—he must pull at the exact moment "barometric silence balanced on the edge of breaking." Cost is visible when the vortex forms and he understands he's "chosen to calibrate the sky itself," though middle sections could tighten the pressure more consistently.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between "sirens that screamed every gale into panic" and the sanctuary's method where "sound was meant to reveal, not warn." The final image of data points as "syllables in the sentence the mountain had begun" offers resonant answer without stating moral. The piece earns its wisdom about listening versus noise through concrete experience of the bell's effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical precision ("microclimate variations," "barometric silence") that reflects the tester's expertise. Perceptual signature shows in how he notices weather details others wouldn't ("temperature dropping one deliberate degree every seven minutes"). Some passages drift into elevated register ("windblown sanctuary above the clouds had no name") that doesn't fully match the character's practical background.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high in technical passages that advance both character expertise and plot pressure. However, several abstract constructions weaken immediacy: "the absence between them, the hush that was not empty but full of withheld thunder" could be more concrete. Template cadence appears in "He [verb]" patterns across multiple lines. The opening sentence runs too long without clear anchor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise of weather calibration through monastic bell-ringing offers fresh synthesis of technical and spiritual elements. The specific detail of "zero hour" as "the moment barometric silence balanced on the edge of breaking" transforms familiar material. However, the sanctuary-as-mystical-site and chosen-one-teaching-another elements follow recognizable templates without sufficient transformation.</comment>
