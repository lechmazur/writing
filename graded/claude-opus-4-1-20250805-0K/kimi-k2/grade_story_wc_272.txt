<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's internal journey from "crestfallen" to "crest no longer fallen" is earned through concrete micro-choices: weaving memory threads, stepping through her painted door, and choosing to sketch "not the skull but the light inside it." The contradictory impulses of fear and necessity act simultaneously throughout, particularly in "Is the dark any darker than the ache of a face no one remembers?" which crystallizes her conflict between dissolution and transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates as Accumulative/Textural, building density through layered imagery (dust as plankton, walls as ribs, memories as threads) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira accepts that "redesign is not escape but acceptance rendered visible." The cost is legible in her descent into "necessary darkness," the luminescent ache that "brightened, sharp and clean," and her final carrying of only "the memory of luminescent ache."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse library constrains choice through its physical deterioration ("sea swallowed the lower stairs," "walls close in") and forces Lira's descent through the painted door. The setting functions as both literal space and psychological landscape, with the "walls exhaled chalk and cedar" responding to her actions, though some spatial transitions remain abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure escalates from external (narrowing corridors) to internal (fragmented self-portraits) to existential ("the mind must descend into necessary darkness or be pressed into paper itself"). Lira's agency drives the resolution through her choice to redesign reality via the tarot circle and painted door, with visible cost in accepting the "luminescent ache."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of identity's fragmentation and reconstruction emerges through concrete particulars: torn tarot cards bleeding together, portraits showing faces "cut into strips and rearranged," and the final portrait "neither hers nor his but both." The ending's image of the lighthouse beam pointing downward into waves that reflect stars offers a non-literal answer about finding light through descent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with distinct perceptual signature ("dust drifted like pale plankton," "vellum wings"). The rhetorical questions function as character-specific thought pattern, and psychic distance modulates purposefully from external observation to deep interiority during the descent sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Salt water kissed her ankles, then her knees; the necessary darkness tasted of brine and ink"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("walls inching inward like ribs," "shelves... like ribs" repetition) and occasional register elevation ("phosphoresce") slightly strain the POV's naturalism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse-as-psychological-space with tarot-as-reality-fragments feels fresh and earned, particularly the transformation where "what had been the moon was now a silver key." The risk of the painted door descent and the final image of drowned portraits opening their eyes heightens stakes while maintaining coherence. Bonus +0.3 for unconventional structural choices that serve closure.</comment>
