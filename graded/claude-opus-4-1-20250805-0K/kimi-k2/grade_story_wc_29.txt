I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inferred: Causal** - The story operates through because/therefore linkages as Lyra's counter-signal causes town behavior changes, which causes trickster retaliation, which causes her mirror-signal solution.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and rooted in her mentor's death ("broken jaw after the tricksters' last game"), driving credible choices under pressure. Internal conflict manifests concretely as her hands shake while calculating the phase shift, and her "cautiously hopeful" trait constrains her actions throughout. The final choice to leave the transmitter running shows earned agency with visible community-level cost paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: signal discovery → counter-signal deployment → trickster retaliation → mirror solution, with clear because/therefore linkages throughout. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the mirrored signal transforms the tricksters' weapon and the town "no longer quite so eager to tear itself apart" - visible social cost paid. The orientation anchors (radio station, Lyra, signal threat) establish clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The radio station basement functions as constraining micro-setting - the "antique transmitter" and "cracked headphones" aren't just description but tools that enable/limit Lyra's tactics. Sensory detail ("solder and ozone," "copper smell of overheated circuitry") is selective and purposeful, filtered through Lyra's technical expertise. The astronomical charts literally guide her calculations, making setting essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally: initial subsonic manipulation → Lyra's counter-signal success → trickster counter-counter-song ("colder and sharper") → final mirror solution. The dominant stake (preventing community self-destruction) tightens when the tricksters respond "so soon, so elegant," forcing Lyra's desperate phase-shift calculation. Visible cost appears as crowds shift from rage to curiosity, paying the price of manipulation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete struggle between signal and noise, manipulation and resistance, without explicit moralizing. The mentor's words "They win when we stop distinguishing signal from noise" gain resonance through dramatized action. The final image of the lullaby drifting through vents offers a non-literal answer about human resilience against cosmic manipulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lyra processes the world through frequencies, oscillations, and electromagnetic phenomena ("tasted like burnt sugar and regret"). Voice maintains technical precision under pressure without losing emotional texture. POV remains strictly limited to Lyra's knowledge, with the tricksters' intentions inferred through their signals rather than stated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves solid clarity with purposeful rhythm variation, though some metaphorical density borders on overwriting ("silky oscillation that tasted like burnt sugar"). Information density is high - most sentences advance plot while building atmosphere. Minor scaffold in "cautiously hopeful" appearing twice identically, but overall momentum remains strong through varied sentence structures.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of subsonic cosmic manipulation offers a fresh angle on alien interference narratives, grounded in specific technical detail. The transformation of lullabies into counter-weapons and the mirror-signal solution feel earned through established physics. However, the mentor-with-dying-wisdom backstory and divided-community frame use familiar templates without full transformation.</comment>
