I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece that builds through lyric density and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the congregation speaks "Remember" together and the world lightens.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cassia's visionary obsession manifests through concrete actions—soldering wires to dreams, harvesting static, mapping shadows—with her loneliness driving increasingly desperate attempts to decode prophecy. Her choice to bow to the shadow-silhouette shows earned acceptance of what she's been shaping. The congregation adds texture but lacks individual pressure on Cassia's choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres through static-to-prophecy-to-manifestation, with "Remember" as the first word creating a resonant reconfiguration that reweights all prior gathering. The cost appears in "iron and lilac" taste and the warning that dawn "would not be gentle," though this conceptual cost could be more visceral. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observatory setting actively shapes every choice—the cobalt glass portico channels lightning for prophecy, the dome's skin becomes a mapping surface, height above clouds enforces isolation. Sensory detail ("bruised beacon," "ozone and copper") is selective and purposeful. The cracked glass becomes a portal, making environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal vigil to collective awakening as the congregation forms and participates in the final revelation. The seven lightning strikes and shadow-silhouette emergence provide the meaningful deepening. However, Cassia's agency diminishes after the congregation arrives—she becomes more vessel than active agent in the final transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between isolation and connection, with "Remember" reframing all prior forgetting as willful amnesia. The "second spine of morning" as forgotten shadow creates resonant complexity. The final image of the world turning "a shade lighter" offers non-literal resolution without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with distinctive constructions ("soldering wires to dreams," "bellies full of static"). The perceptual signature—seeing prophecy in gaps, tracking shadows obsessively—remains character-specific throughout. Rhythm modulates effectively from contemplative to urgent during the storm sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("cobalt glass portico at the dome's entrance drank the lightning and glowed"). Strong verb choices throughout ("drank," "exhaled," "dissolved"). Minor weakness in the truncated ending and occasional abstraction ("variant allegiance to futures"), but no loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of technical language with mystical purpose ("soldering wires to dreams," "receivers tuned to gaps between stations") creates fresh texture. The shadow as "second spine of morning" and the congregation speaking through shared taste is genuinely inventive. The observatory-as-nest metaphor earned through accumulation.</comment>
