<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora's internal conflict between sharing and hoarding knowledge manifests through concrete actions (hiding the tube, allowing discovery), and her protective feeling toward the breach creates genuine contradiction. The choice to leave the tube for discovery carries visible cost—she "kissed it coolly like releasing a child to the unknown." However, the follower remains too shadowy to fully pressure her decision, and some interiority veers toward abstraction ("integrity need not scream").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery (brass tube, quarantine zone, stone cherubs) culminating in Liora's decision to share dangerous knowledge through "delayed disclosure." The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—she transforms from solitary recorder to one who enables "lateral migration of truth," with cost visible in releasing her precious tube. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words, and the pattern of lateral movement pays off. Minor causality wobble: the follower's exact motivation remains too vague.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The courtyard's dry fountain becomes instrumental when Liora uses its stones to create the hiding cavity, while the quarantine zone's "graphite sweet, leaf-flat, wrong" wind provides visceral threat. The brass tube functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its antique value tempts the follower and its placement determines disclosure method. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from observatory to cloister to courtyard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to share dangerous knowledge about the quarantine breach—escalates from being followed to sensing the watcher to making the decisive choice to enable discovery. Liora's agency drives the resolution through deliberate action ("With deliberate lateral motion she shifted three stones"). Cost manifests in releasing control of information that could endanger others. The follower's pressure could be more concrete to fully tighten options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between institutional silence ("Authorities built razor fences and silence") and truth's need to spread ("lateral migration of truth across careful gardens"). The brass tube transforms from personal talisman to seed of disclosure, reweighting its meaning. The final image of moonlight "washing everything with layered tranquility" while the zone grinds "like a vast patient heart" creates resonance without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's perceptual signature shines through selective scientific attention ("noted every breath of wind and cloud") filtered through emotional connection ("parental toward the breach"). Syntax modulates with tension—longer, complex sentences during reflection compress to shorter units during the hiding sequence. The voice maintains consistency even under pressure, though occasional abstractions ("layered tranquility") slightly dilute the texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong moments like "tasting iron silence" and "graphite sweet, leaf-flat, wrong" demonstrate precise sensory work. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. However, some phrases edge toward overwriting ("wine-dark archway," "ouroboros tongues"), and abstract constructions like "credibly curious" and "layered tranquility" appear multiple times without earning their repetition through pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of "delayed disclosure" through hidden knowledge offers a fresh angle on whistleblowing narratives, and the quarantine zone as sympathetic entity ("parental toward the breach") subverts disaster tropes. The specific synthesis of storm recording with moral choice feels earned. The brass tube's transformation from protective talisman to planted seed demonstrates organic originality.</comment>
