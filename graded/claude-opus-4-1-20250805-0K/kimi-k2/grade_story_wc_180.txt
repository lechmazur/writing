I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered imagery and symbolic accretion toward a resonant reconfiguration where mother and daughter reconnect through ritual action.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mender's motivation to heal both orchard and daughter is clear, with concrete embodied details like "heart buckled" and specific micro-choices (using copper nails, climbing higher). The daughter's arc from "ribbonless" anger to reconciliation feels earned through accumulated pressure, though her emotional turn could use one more beat of internal resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure building to Resonant Reconfiguration where binding wrists transforms the breach into "sweet rot that feeds next year's bloom." The orientation anchors (cathedral, mender, daughter's departure) establish clearly by ~100 words. Cost is visible in the traded eye and the acceptance of imperfect healing rather than erasure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exceptional integration where setting IS the conflict - the orchard-cathedral fusion constrains choices (must climb through branches) and charges the final image. Specific sensory work: "boots crunching on stained glass shards," "sap weeping like hot wax." The environment actively participates through the trees' memory-holding and punishment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative deepening: wound-mending leads to grandmother's face appearing, then daughter's childhood memory, culminating in wrist-binding reconciliation. The dominant stake (generational healing) tightens as each climb reveals deeper emotional territory, with visible cost in accepting the "sweet rot" rather than perfect resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor "generational wisdom is not a bridge but a graft: the old wood must split so the new can slip inside." The deciduous vows concept layers throughout without explicit moralizing. The final image of petals as "soft amendments" resonates without stating meaning directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "fig and apple branches threading through stone ribs like green embroidery." POV remains stable with the mender throughout. Slight register elevation in places ("accidental wisdom") but largely maintains consistency. The perceptual signature of a craftsperson noting materials and textures anchors the voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("leaves whispered of the breach"). Minor template cadence in "She began...She understood...She found" progression. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. The "accidentally, to forgive itself" ending lands effectively despite the adverb.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cathedral and orchard creates an original setting that couldn't be swapped. The concept of trees holding memories and bearing "fruit that tasted of every secret" transforms familiar elements. The specific integration of craft (quartz-eye mending) with emotional repair avoids generic reconciliation templates.</comment>
