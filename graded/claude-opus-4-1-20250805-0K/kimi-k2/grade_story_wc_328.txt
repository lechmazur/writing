I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern intensification rather than strict causal linkage, culminating in a transformative metamorphosis.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vale's motivation to understand her changed brother drives consistent choices through pretense, descent, and listening rituals. The internal contradiction between researcher/cryptid crystallizes believably at closure with visible cost (her transformation). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("harmony untamed," "gravitationally playful") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from underground listening to cosmic transformation, with the metamorphosis serving as decisive change with clear cost (Vale losing human form). The closure lands powerfully as she and Orion become the very cryptids she once researched, spreading "temporary galaxies." Slight deduction for the abstract "We became the joke the sky tells itself" which strains comprehension momentarily.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The underground garden with its bioluminescent ferns and dream-nettle creates vivid constraint, while frost that never thaws and gravity-defying obsidian droplets build surreal pressure. Setting literally transforms Vale through the melting phone and rising garden. The final frost flowers blooming on concrete perfectly charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation works through textural intensification: static voices → phone melting → gravity defying → full metamorphosis. Vale's agency drives the key moment when she presses the arrowhead to the phone's "molten heart," triggering transformation. The cost is unmistakable as she becomes "both researcher and cryptid," losing human form to join the changed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the concept of transformation as cosmic joke—those who search for the missing become the missing. The arrowhead's evolution from toy to promise to "weight...like a private planet" to final stylus reweights meaning without stating morals. The ending's "temporary galaxies for strangers to pocket" offers resonant hope without resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled surreal register ("roots of a dream-nettle," "fossils in amber"). Some elevated diction occasionally strains POV credibility ("metamorphose," "gravitationally playful"). The perceptual signature remains consistent through Vale's transformation, though brief moments of abstraction ("harmony untamed") momentarily blur immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("frost blooming into glassy petals that refracted memories"). However, abstract phrases like "harmony untamed" and "gravitationally playful" create opacity in peak beats. Some elevated register drift ("metamorphose," "rewritten") doesn't fully match the established voice. Information density remains high throughout with good propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of cryptid research, underground herbalism, and cosmic transformation creates something genuinely fresh. The concept of researchers becoming what they study, delivered through surreal physics and botany, feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with gravity-defying imagery and the transformation sequence heightens stakes while maintaining clarity (+0.4 within band).</comment>
