I'll evaluate this story systematically according to the rubric.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages from Lira hearing silence, to discovering the secret passage, to releasing the mechanical birds that spark revolution.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation crystallizes through action rather than declaration - her shift from obedient sentinel to revolutionary saboteur emerges through concrete choices (scratching the sigil, programming the birds). The internal contradiction between duty and rebellion plays out in embodied moments, though some revolutionary impulses feel slightly underdeveloped before the decisive turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from blackout to revolution with clear closure - Lira completes her sabotage and returns to her post, having irrevocably changed the city's trajectory. The "lock is awake; gate is listening" pamphlet provides resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (the revolution now underway). Who/where/when anchored immediately.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fort's architecture becomes instrumental - the hidden seam, spiral stair, and forge aren't mere backdrop but enable Lira's choices. Sensory detail (violet afterglow, hot metal scent, basalt steps) creates atmosphere while the half-painted sundial functions as both setting element and plot mechanism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds causally from passive observation to active rebellion - each discovery (sigil→passage→forge→birds) narrows Lira's options toward revolution. The stakes intensify as she risks exposure, with the Regent's guards passing while she conceals her sabotage, creating palpable tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lock/gate metaphor evolves from literal (Lira as sentinel) to metaphorical (consciousness awakening), with the bronze quill holder bridging both meanings. Theme emerges through action rather than statement, though the final pamphlet line edges toward explicit articulation of the story's thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled rhythm - "winking hush that invited mischief" captures the conspiratorial tone throughout. POV remains tightly focused on Lira with no leakage, and diction matches the quasi-medieval fantasy setting consistently.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Some figurative language feels slightly overwrought ("constellation of rebellion," "syllable in a sentence too long suppressed") but doesn't obscure clarity. Information density remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mechanical birds as message-carriers offers a fresh take on fantasy revolution, combining clockwork aesthetics with political uprising. The specific detail of programming flight paths via sundial coordinates shows inventive world-building that serves the plot.</comment>
