<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist's "perceptively calm" demeanor holds consistently through collective ritual, and her motivation to "transmute pain into a masterpiece" drives concrete actions—laying photographs, creating spiral patterns. The trumpet man's hesitation then participation shows earned change with visible cost (tears that "smelled of lavender"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around healing that lacks full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens coheres as photographs accumulate into a spiral pattern that transforms both field and participants, with the trumpet man hearing "his own lost song returning transfigured" as the resonant reconfiguration. Cost is visible in relinquished memories and tears. The final image of children playing on enriched soil extends the transformation. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the "who."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lavender field and ruined factory create genuine constraint—the archivist must work with curved rows "like sheet music" and the photographs interact with soil warmth. Sensory details layer effectively: "iron scent of the ruins until the air tasted like a lullaby sung by ghosts." The vines climbing and blooming white flowers mirror the human healing pattern below, making environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes accumulate through textural deepening as each photograph adds to the pattern, with the trumpet man's arrival creating the key intensification—his participation validates the collective ritual. The spiral formation and subsequent transformation of photographs ("edges curling, silvering") shows meaningful deepening. Cost is legible in tears and relinquished memories, though agency remains somewhat passive rather than contested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the concrete act of transforming individual pain into collective beauty—never stated but enacted through the spiral's creation. The final image of children playing where "laughter sounded richer" and "scraped knees healed faster" offers a non-literal answer about how pain enriches future ground. The archivist's cyclic return suggests healing as seasonal work, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric control with distinctive perceptual signature: "vines climbed the last intact smokestack, their green fingers curling like signatures on a forgotten treaty." Rhythm modulates effectively between contemplative observation and emotional peaks. The consistent use of synesthetic imagery ("air tasted like a lullaby") creates coherent texture, though occasional abstraction around "collective healing" slightly weakens specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful imagery that advances atmosphere. Information density is high—most sentences do multiple jobs. Some abstract phrasing around healing concepts ("collective healing spreading like ripples") and occasional elevated diction ("transmute," "transfigured") create minor friction with otherwise grounded imagery. No significant loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of archiving others' unwanted memories as photographs to create healing ground offers fresh synthesis. The specific detail of photographs changing physically in soil while the trumpet man hears lost music through roots shows imaginative reach. The cyclical structure with the archivist's perpetual return avoids conventional resolution, though the healing-through-art premise has familiar elements.</comment>
