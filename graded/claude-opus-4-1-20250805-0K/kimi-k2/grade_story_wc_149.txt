I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and pattern repetition toward a resonant reconfiguration where forgiveness releases both souls.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ghost bride's motivation crystallizes through contradictory impulses—revenge and love operating simultaneously in her carrying the bead that holds his soul. Her forgiveness earns its weight through "lovingly venomous" poison that embodies this contradiction. Internal conflict manifests concretely through frost on fruit and the warm bead, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the resolution sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands powerfully as Resonant Reconfiguration—forgiveness dissolves both the bead and her binding, with visible cost in their eternal separation. The accumulative structure coheres through returning images (fruit, veil, bead) that reweight at the ending when dawn breaks the endless night. Causality holds under the textural lens as each visit builds toward this release, though the three-lifetime scope creates minor orientation friction early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as both setting and constraint—its black glass and glowing fruit create the story's governing physics where souls bind to matter. "Winter-cracked fields" and "soot from furnaces below" ground the fantastical in tactile detail. The environment directly enables the resolution when "the greenhouse's endless night began to crack," making setting indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation—each nightly visit adds "resonant awakenings" until the debt reaches its tipping point. The ghost bride's agency drives the resolution through her choice to forgive, with clear cost in their mutual dissolution. Pressure coheres under the textural lens as memories accumulate through the trees' network, though the conflict could tighten slightly in the middle third.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "lovingly venomous"—how love enables both betrayal and forgiveness. The final snow carrying "fragments of love that had bound them across lifetimes" offers resonant answer without moralizing. The carved bead's symbols that "shifted when viewed from different angles" embody the story's moral complexity, where debt and redemption coexist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains Gothic register consistently through "ashen-veil," "ephemeral cameo appearances," and "winter-cracked fields." The prose modulates effectively between ethereal descriptions and concrete action. Some phrases like "mournful elation" feel slightly overwrought, and occasional filter constructions ("she saw") diminish immediacy in key moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong atmospheric density with lines like "fruit that glowed like captive stars." Information density is high—most sentences advance both plot and atmosphere. Minor issues include repetitive "had + past participle" constructions in backstory sections and occasional overwriting ("lovingly venomous" works thematically but strains as description). The final image of the warm bead "humming with resonant awakenings" lands with appropriate weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse where souls bind to fruit offers fresh synthesis of Gothic and fantastical elements. The ghost bride who poisons her betrayer with "lovingly venomous" tears transforms the vengeful spirit trope through specific emotional complexity. While some elements echo familiar Gothic patterns, the execution through glowing fruit and carved beads creates memorable specificity.</comment>
