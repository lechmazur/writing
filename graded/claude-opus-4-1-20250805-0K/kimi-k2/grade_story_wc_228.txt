I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and pattern, with the painted seashell's transformation serving as the central accumulative device that reweights meaning at closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The painter's motivation crystallizes through embodied detail ("salt first stung his eyes," "seashell warm against his ribs") and his final choice to leave the blank shell shows earned renunciation with visible cost. The "intimately aloof" characterization manifests consistently in his detached observation even of his younger self, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("temporary eternity he had been circling").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the painter's act of leaving the blank shell for others constitutes Earned Stasis with clear cost ("forgive the leaving"). The accumulative structure coheres through the seashell's transformation from painted sunrise to blank canvas, and the mirror's crack-to-scar arc frames the journey effectively, though the cave discovery feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cave network functions as more than setting—its nautilus chambers mirror the story's spiral structure and the phosphorescent veins create atmosphere while the lagoon enables the central transformation. The quay/attic/cave progression tracks cleanly, though the "wrong turn" transition could be more causally grounded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative deepening as each cave chamber intensifies the mirror motif ("reflecting his face in fragments") until the lagoon scene where pigment bleeding creates the decisive transformation. The water rising sequence generates genuine pressure with visible cost in the painter's stillness, effectively narrowing his options to acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central image of the dissolving/reforming sunrise as "the heartbeat of every departure, every return." The concept of "temporary eternity" avoids abstraction by grounding in concrete details (the blank shell left behind), and the final insight about forgiving departure resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("hairline fracture running from corner to corner like a lightning bolt frozen mid-flash") and consistent perceptual signature focused on artistic observation. The prose modulates effectively between contemplative and urgent registers, though occasional phrases like "temporary eternity" risk opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clean, purposeful prose with strong rhythm variation and no significant loops or scaffolding. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The cave sighed, a sound like canvas being stretched"). Minor register elevation in places ("intimately aloof from his own younger self") but generally maintains momentum through precise imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of painter/memory/place through the painted seashell device shows genuine originality, transforming the return-home trope through the specific lens of artistic preservation and release. The hidden cave oasis and the pigment-bleeding transformation sequence feel earned rather than convenient, creating a fresh take on reconciliation with the past.</comment>
