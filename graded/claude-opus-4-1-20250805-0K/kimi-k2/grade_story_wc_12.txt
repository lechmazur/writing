<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The priest's contradictory impulses between silence and action manifest through concrete embodied choices (recording absence, offering the bow), with his final choice to transfer the shimmer carrying visible cost. The demon's wavering between acceptance and refusal creates genuine tension, though some interior states lean toward abstraction ("soft as snowfall").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with pattern-taught layering of silence that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the demon dissolves into text, reinforcing the anchor's lattice—clear cost in the priest's transferred shimmer and empty palette. The orientation anchors early (dimensional anchor, priest, demon threat) and the closure lands with visible transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor functions as active setting that trembles, communicates in Morse, and ultimately absorbs the demon's substance, constraining choices throughout. The pearlescent color that "decorates with silence" and the loop pedal serve as micro-settings that shape tactics, though some descriptions drift toward the abstract ("space folded like origami").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative layering—each recorded silence adds rhetorical weight until the demon must choose between accepting constructed quiet or remaining outside. The cost manifests in the priest's drained palette and lost shimmer, with the demon's dissolution carrying clear consequence for both entities.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the confrontation between assumption and illumination, with the loop pedal's reversals revealing hidden premises without stating them directly. The final image of letters dissolving into lattice threads offers a non-literal answer about how unexamined beliefs structure reality, though "decorates with silence" occasionally feels forced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("muffled clarity, syllables wrapped in felt yet sharp as glass"), though some constructions feel overwrought. The perceptual signature of reading tremors as Morse code and experiencing silence as chord maintains consistency, but occasional register drift ("axiom," "chiasmus") strains the mystical-practical balance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and strong verb choices, but overwriting appears in metaphor density ("frost on a window," "soft as snowfall," "fiber optics" in quick succession). Some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("the stillness between heartbeats was still negotiable"), and the unfinished final sentence reads as error rather than effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of loop pedal technology with exorcism ritual creates genuine freshness, transforming familiar possession tropes through specific mechanics of recorded silence and reversed assumptions. The demon speaking "only in assumptions" and the priest's vow to illuminate them before they become dogma offers a non-obvious angle on spiritual confrontation.</comment>
