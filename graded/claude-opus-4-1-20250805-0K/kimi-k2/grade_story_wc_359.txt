I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's synesthetic perception creates a distinctive interiority with embodied sensations ("wintergreen and starlight," "cedar and longing") that drive her choices. Her motivation to "unfetter wonder from the tyranny of ordinary sound" is clear and consistent. The sculptor's wordless acknowledgment provides meaningful external pressure. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("to certify wonder as essential") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the marble transforms into a bell that produces "oscillating repose," fundamentally reweighting silence as active rather than absent. The cost is legible in the sculptor's submission and the protagonist releasing "years" of coiled hush. Early orientation is clean (ice cavern, bell ringer, alone). The pattern of synesthetic translation builds coherently toward the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ice cavern functions as more than backdrop—its frozen columns resonate with "turquoise silence, amber hush, indigo awe," becoming an instrument itself. The marble block's resistance to chisels creates a concrete constraint that the protagonist must overcome differently. Aurora colors slide "like warm silk" across skin, grounding the fantastical in tactile reality. The setting actively participates in the closure when ice crystals rearrange into "fractal cathedrals."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation follows the accumulative lens well—from tasting hush, to releasing it, to the marble's transformation, each beat deepens the dominant stake of proving "awe could exist without noise." The cost accumulates through surrendering her "guarded silence" and the sculptor's acknowledgment of limitation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the marble "softened beneath her touch," forcing irreversible change.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "sculpted hush" and bells that "rang without clanging." The story interrogates whether wonder requires conventional expression, answered through the marble's transformation without chisel. The sculptor's final bow acknowledges "some art must be felt rather than heard," earning this insight through dramatized failure and witness. Slight deduction for "wonder certified as essential" reading somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"breath crystallizing into brief chandeliers" establishes immediate texture. The synesthetic POV creates a unique perceptual signature where colors have taste and silence has texture. Prose rhythm modulates effectively, accelerating during the transformation sequence. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("unfetter," "tyranny") that briefly distances from the embodied perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery ("paper bird, delicate yet fierce"), though some passages edge toward overwriting ("liquid glass" metaphor slightly strains). Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. Some repetition of "sculpted hush" and variations, though it serves the accumulative pattern. The ending image of the bell's "bronze heart, oscillating between stillness and awe forever" resonates without overstatement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthesia with silence-as-substance creates genuine originality—bells that produce "sculpted hush in perfect spheres" is memorably specific. The concept of marble refusing chisels but accepting sung color transforms familiar creative struggle into something fresh. Risk-taking in the non-causal, accumulative structure heightens the piece's dreamlike coherence. The aurora-as-chord system feels inevitable rather than ornamental.</comment>
