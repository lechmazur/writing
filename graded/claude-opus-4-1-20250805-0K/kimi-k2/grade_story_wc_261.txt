I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation through the telepathic burden and brother's death is vivid and embodied, particularly in "her tongue tasting of iodine and regret" and the plants' whispered "tunnel." The internal contradiction between seeking closure and opening wounds drives meaningful choices. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution where removing the shard immediately ends her telepathy without more complex emotional residue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught symbolism (hourglass, coffee rings, scars) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara releases the trapped moment. The closure lands with visible cost—23 years of burden released through blood and acceptance. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3. The "displaced miracle" choosing the wrong sibling provides clear causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tower setting constrains choices through the ivy's guidance and spatial choreography from room to kitchen to balcony. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "meteor hush of dawn," "cool stone wall," coffee rings' condensation. The recurring ivy and fern actively shape Mara's path. Slight deduction for the tower's abstract quality beyond its vertical structure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from physical wound to emotional revelation about the brother's death through the coffee ring reading. The dominant stake—releasing the trapped moment—tightens as Mara reopens her scar, paying visible cost in blood. Agency manifests through deliberate self-wounding to complete the interrupted transfer. Minor deduction for the relatively smooth resolution without more friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "closure seeker who opens wounds" and the hourglass as displaced miracle. The coffee rings sequence brilliantly physicalizes memory and loss. The final image of learning to "read the stories in scars that no longer bled" offers resonant closure without moralizing. Theme of accepting incomplete miracles lands with specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "meteor hush," "green static," "displaced miracle refusing to fall." POV remains tightly focused through Mara's perceptual signature. The prose modulates effectively from clinical opening to mystical revelation. Minor deduction for occasional elevation that slightly exceeds the established register ("consensus of acceptance").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the coffee rings passage. Strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of key phrases. Some figurative density in places ("meteor hush" appears twice) but generally serves the accumulative design. Minor template cadence in the plant descriptions but within acceptable bounds for the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of medical procedure with mystical plant telepathy feels fresh, particularly the hourglass shard as physical manifestation of trapped time. The coffee ring divination and upward-falling sand show genuine ingenuity. The specific 23-year timeline and sibling survivor guilt ground the fantastical elements in emotional truth.</comment>
