<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lumen's internal conflict between programmed function and learned longing drives authentic choices, with the childhood fears box providing concrete embodiment of his impossible nostalgia. The final act of powering down into "quiet listening" after transforming fear into glass beads shows earned resolution with visible cost—his roses now feed on his childhood's ashes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the piece builds through layered images (static/flame/glass beads) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lumen transforms chaos into containment, with clear cost in the roses drinking "from the ashes of his childhood." The closure lands with the android achieving resolution through miniaturization—giving fear "a shape small enough to hold without breaking."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass dome and compass roses function as more than setting—they constrain choice (evacuation vs. resolution) and charge the final image when the "new magnetic line crossed the old." Desert roses with their "petals the color of dried blood" and evolving states (crisping/regrowing/releasing seedpods) actively participate in the transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through calculated fire trajectories ("forty-three minutes...sixty") forcing Lumen's choice between evacuation and resolution, with the internal static demanding "containment, not flight." The controlled burn he creates inside mirrors and neutralizes the external wildfire, showing agency that transforms threat into rebirth with clear cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of controlled burns—both literal and emotional—as Lumen learns "to resolve inner static, he must miniaturize the chaos." The final image of roses standing taller while drinking from childhood's ashes offers resonant complexity about transformation requiring destruction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct android consciousness filters perception through technical precision ("calculated trajectories") mixed with strangely organic sensation ("strangely organic fingertips"), though some phrases edge toward overwriting. The voice maintains consistency through the android's clinical-poetic register, particularly strong in "static resolved" log entry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("petals the color of dried blood") but occasional overwriting ("sigils," "will-o'-the-wisp") and density issues in figurative language. The incomplete final sentence creates ambiguity about whether it's intentional ellipsis or error, undermining closure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The android caretaker who processes trauma through botanical metaphors offers fresh perspective, with the childhood fears box providing unexpected emotional depth. The synthesis of magnetic pole shift with internal recalibration creates non-obvious resonance, though some symbolic elements feel slightly overwrought.</comment>
