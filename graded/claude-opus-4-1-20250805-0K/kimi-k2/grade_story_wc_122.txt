I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through sensory layers and ritual accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara's numbness transforms into renewed feeling.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is embodied through specific sensory loss ("palms on soundboards, wrists against throats") and the numbness that has crept "past her ears into her chest." The final choice to teach through vibration shows earned transformation with visible cost—she cannot hear but can feel again. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around the "filament of hush" concept.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through ritual steps toward Mara's restoration of feeling. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when she feels "the last shard of numbness dissolved" and teaches children through vibration. Cost is visible in her permanent deafness traded for renewed tactile connection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cavern setting actively shapes the ritual ("each wall curved like a struck membrane") and provides the copper disc, goat skin, and acoustic properties necessary for transformation. The drum becomes micro-setting that enables Mara's choice. Deduction for some abstract atmospheric description that doesn't constrain action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative ritual—from threading the useless needle through copper, to stretching skin, to the drum's creation, to Mara striking it and experiencing reversed memories. The dominant stake (defeating numbness) tightens as each step builds toward her transformation, with cost visible in accepting permanent deafness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of silence creating feeling—"silence could be a score if you listened with your whole body." The final image of Mara teaching through vibration resonantly answers the question of how to connect without conventional senses. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit "rewinding grief" metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with sensory-rich prose ("cavern breathed resin and cedar") and controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The perceptual signature focuses on vibration and texture. Some register elevation in places ("cathedral," "enthrall") slightly exceeds the intimate POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong sensory density and varied rhythm, particularly in ritual sequences. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("filament of hush," "mirrored hush") and some elevated diction that borders on overwriting in peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of backward-playing silence that unwinds numbness offers a fresh angle on healing through paradox. The specific synthesis of deafness, music teaching, and vibrational connection feels non-obvious. The ritual transformation avoids generic healing tropes through its particular logic.</comment>
