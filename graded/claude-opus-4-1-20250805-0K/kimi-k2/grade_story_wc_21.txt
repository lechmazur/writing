<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict between bearing witness and the weight of retrocognitive memory creates genuine contradictory impulses, particularly in "felt the poet's fear braid with her own resolve." The final choice to speak names aloud despite physical cost ("staggered, but kept arranging") is earned through accumulated pressure, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("responsibility" rather than embodied sensation).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara transforms from passive archivist to active witness, with visible cost in her staggering and the "retrocognitive hold loosen, not releasing her but transforming into responsibility." The cipher's solution through empathy rather than logic provides causal linkage, and the final image of the zeppelin carrying "unburied truth toward courts" crystallizes the reconfigured stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon functions as both setting and constraint, its "black veins" mirroring Elara's debris patterns and ultimately revealing coordinates—environment directly shapes the solution method. Sensory details like "salt and ozone coiling" and "water warm, almost breathing" create visceral atmosphere that charges the final revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation builds through deepening retrocognitive immersion: from initial memory surges to "memories were louder" to the full flood of "the poet's last moment," each intensification narrowing Elara's options toward the necessary act of witness. The cost manifests physically ("staggered") and psychologically as the "retrocognitive hold" transforms into permanent "responsibility."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of "Truth is tension between what was lost and what refuses to stay buried" emerges through concrete action—arranging debris, speaking names, water rising through sand—rather than declaration. The final image of courts "that still pretended amnesia was peace" offers a resonant non-literal answer about memory's persistence against erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges in how Elara processes retrocognitive intrusions ("memories that were not hers surged backward") and her archivist's attention to detail ("cross-referencing microfiche and whispered testimonies"). Some passages drift toward elevated register ("searing reverie," "flotsam the wind had carried") that slightly tensions against the controlled professional voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "The deck was littered with flotsam the wind had carried from the drowned coast" which establishes setting, atmosphere, and materials simultaneously. Minor overwriting appears in figurative clusters ("black water glinting like spilled ink," "gangway to the observation deck that hung like a gull's nest") and some abstract phrasing ("responsibility" rather than embodied consequence) that slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of civil rights investigation with supernatural retrocognition creates a non-obvious angle on historical trauma narratives. The specific method of solving the cipher through empathetic arrangement of debris rather than logic, and the image of water as liquid memory waiting for witness, transforms familiar disappeared-persons material through earned particularity.</comment>
