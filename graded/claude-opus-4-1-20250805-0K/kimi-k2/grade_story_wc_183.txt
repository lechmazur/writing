I'll evaluate this story systematically through each category.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict between staying/leaving manifests through embodied details like the emerald card cutting crescents into their palm and the vine tightening around their wrist. The final choice between "Stay" and "Go" threads carries genuine cost, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("unkindled solace," "trapped freedom") rather than lived sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery (carnival ship, garden of names, narrative threads). Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the protagonist floats away, threading letters into a new name "that held both of us without splitting." However, orientation remains deliberately vague past 120 words without clear payoff at closure (-0.3 applied).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival ship functions as more than setting—its warped planks, melting clown paintings, and upside-down garden actively constrain the protagonist's journey. The environment literally dissolves as memory, forcing the final leap. Sensory details like "fog...tasting of copper" and "cotton candy turned to ash" create visceral atmosphere through the protagonist's grief-altered perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as the ship dissolves and the fog erases the garden's names "as fast as they bloomed." The protagonist faces a genuine dilemma: "To stay was to forget; to leave was to lose her again." The final choice between caught names ("Stay" vs "Go") crystallizes this tension with visible cost as the ship sinks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of naming/forgetting without explicit moralizing. The "garden of forgotten names" and the protagonist threading "a new name for myself, one that held both of us" offers a non-literal answer about grief and identity. The final image of floating with "a lullaby for the half-alive" resonantly reweights the journey without stating meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinctive lyric register with controlled compression ("chimera twin discoverer who had once been two"). The perceptual signature—seeing the ship as "a whale carcass dreaming of music"—reveals a mind processing grief through surreal transformation. Syntax modulates effectively, shortening during decisive moments ("I caught one: 'Stay.' But I chose the other: 'Go.'").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of striking imagery but suffers from occasional overwriting—"blissfully aberrant chord" and "unkindled solace" feel forced rather than organic. Some metaphors strain coherence (fog that "digests" sound while also "shaping itself into her silhouette"). Information density remains high with most sentences advancing multiple layers, though abstract diction occasionally dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of exploring a dissolving carnival ship as externalized memory offers genuine freshness. The specific synthesis of carnival imagery with grief—"skeletal remains of a calliope exhaled one blissfully aberrant chord"—feels both surprising and inevitable. The story takes risks with its surreal logic and fragmented structure that heighten rather than obscure its emotional core.</comment>
