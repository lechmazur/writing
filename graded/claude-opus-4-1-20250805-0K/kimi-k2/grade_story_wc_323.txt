<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The instructor's grief-driven motivation to transgress the council's ban and navigate by alien glyphs is viscerally embodied through the anchor link's weight "heavier than memory" and her acceptance that "grief had already done that" (lured her to unbreathable depths). The final transformation from teaching dead satellites to "stars that shine from the bottom up" shows earned change through specific loss and discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through layered images (drowned moons, unfolded horizons, stars as braille) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the abyss becomes "another sky." Cost is legible in the wife's death, the council's prohibition, and the instructor's isolation as she leaves "the known grid." The final teaching moment crystallizes the transformation with visible stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The benthic city's alien architecture with "angles [that] refused Euclidean certainty" and glyphs that "rearranged themselves whenever she blinked" constrains navigation choices and enables the final discovery. The environment actively shapes the protagonist's journey from balcony to trench lip to the inverted sphere, with each space forcing new ways of reading reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal grief through forbidden study to the dive beyond "the known grid," with each step foreclosing return to her old life. The anchor link's transformation from grief-weight to "sextant" shows agency-driven progression. Cost accumulates through isolation, transgression, and the final acceptance that mourning and love exist in transformed balance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete journey from fixed navigation points to "the rhythm of edges folding and unfolding," never stated abstractly. The wife's lesson about stars being "around us" pays off in the sphere where the city inverts and "horizon" appears in her handwriting, offering a non-literal answer about grief's transformation rather than erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters the alien geometry through nautical vocabulary ("sextant," "bearings," "anchor") and embodied grief. The prose rhythm accelerates during the dive sequence with shorter, denser sentences, then expands in the sphere discovery. No head-hopping; controlled psychic distance maintains intimacy without filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and density with images doing multiple jobs (the anchor link as grief-weight, memory-object, and navigation tool). Some elevated diction edges toward register drift ("benthic," "Euclidean certainty," "tectonic sigh") but remains mostly within an instructor's plausible lexicon. The final teaching image lands cleanly without loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of underwater alien architecture with stellar navigation through grief creates a non-obvious emotional logic where "starlight was not light at all but the memory of gravity." The risk of following forbidden glyphs beyond human maps pays off in the sphere revelation that reframes loss as expansion rather than closure.</comment>
