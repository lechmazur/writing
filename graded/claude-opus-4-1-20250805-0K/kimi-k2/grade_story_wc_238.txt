I'll evaluate this literary story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This story operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens. The narrative builds through layered imagery (perfume, requiem, orchard), metaphorical exchanges, and a pattern of sensory accumulation that culminates in the ghost's dissolution and the orchard's transformed destruction. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the apple-seed rest that reweights the entire piece.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The exorcist's contradictory impulses (professional duty vs. personal guilt) manifest through concrete actions—uncorking perfume, pressing bottle to pipe, transferring apology to bark. Her micro-choices under pressure reveal clear values with visible cost. The ghost's transformation from "eyes silvered by betrayal" to placing "a hand over her heart" shows earned change through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the ghost's dissolution into "almost-music" and the orchard's singing destruction reweight the opening's "imperfect miracle." The apple-seed rest functions as both literal notation and conceptual bridge. Cost is legible in "stumps glistened like open mouths mid-phrase" and the exorcist's inability to look back. The accumulative lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sheet music archive and orchard function as dual settings that constrain choices—the requiem can only be found here, the apology must arrive before bulldozers. Sensory details like "bergamot and regret" and "dust into slow spirals" serve the accumulative drive. The copper pipe becomes essential infrastructure for the ghost's manifestation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal guilt to the orchard's imminent destruction, creating time pressure that forces the apology. The ghost's progression from silence to smile to dissolution shows deepening under the accumulative lens. Cost manifests in the orchard's sacrifice—"falling branches sang the newly written rest"—though agency could be stronger in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The central metaphor "A tree forgets the axe only when the sap forgives the wound" brilliantly encapsulates the theme of incomplete severance requiring reconciliation. The apple-seed rest transforms from musical notation to organic symbol to philosophical statement about imperfect miracles. The ending's "music remained, imperfect, miraculous, and finally free" offers a non-literal answer that reweights everything prior.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"yellowed paper," "brittle scores," "salt rings." The exorcist's perceptual signature filters everything through musical and botanical metaphors consistently. Minor weakness in dialogue naturalism ("I need to reconnect with the spirit I banished") but recovers with the metaphorical exchange that follows.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with evocative phrases like "the hush before the orchard's trees are cut down felt like a held breath." Some density issues with figurative language clustering ("pearled along the ghost's translucent lashes," "phosphor," "apple seed" in rapid succession). Template cadence appears briefly ("She lifted...She began...She continued") but doesn't pervade.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of exorcism, musical composition, and orchard destruction creates an original constellation. The "gossip-column exorcist" subverts genre expectations while the induced currents through copper pipes offer fresh supernatural mechanics. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode and metaphor-driven dialogue heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>
