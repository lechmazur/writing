I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece. The story builds through layered imagery, symbolic objects, and pattern-based revelation rather than causal plot mechanics. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the shared understanding and transformation of both registrars.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The registrars' motivations emerge through concrete actions—pocketing the lens, decoding doodles, offering reconciliation—with embodied tension in "pulls a new stub from her coat and begins scribbling." The predecessor's twenty-year guilt and the protagonist's choice to bridge their divide show contradictory impulses (secrecy vs. transparency) acting simultaneously, though some interiority relies on abstraction rather than sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres well with the lens revelation serving as catalyst for reconciliation, and closure lands with visible cost ("twenty years" of deception acknowledged). However, the whispering crystal's sudden personification ("stone choosing to offer comment") introduces a fantastical element not established early enough, creating mild coherence friction. The orientation anchors clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forecourt's crystal and marble architecture actively shapes behavior—characters whisper, eavesdrop through acoustic properties, meet "at the center where puddles still hold mirror versions." The projector lens constrains perception and enables revelation. Minor deduction for the unexplained crystal's whisper, but setting consistently pressures choices through its acoustic and reflective properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from solitary observation to discovering fraud to choosing reconciliation, with the lens-decoded message forcing the protagonist's decision. The predecessor's descent and ledger presentation show agency-driven escalation. Cost is visible in "twenty years" of concealment, though the resolution's ease ("neither grip questions presence") slightly undercuts the accumulated tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lens metaphor—"honesty sometimes hurts precisely because it adds nothing"—and culminates in "Truth weighs more, but it is easier to carry than secrets." The recurring transparency/clarity motif reweights from isolation to connection. Slight deduction for the overtly thematic dialogue, but the physical lens grounds abstraction effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with selective perception ("droplets still slide like silent apologies") and controlled rhythm. However, both characters' dialogue converges to similar registers ("Truth weighs more..." / "I thought concealing gaps..."), lacking distinct lexical signatures. The prose texture is purposeful but occasionally overwrought ("ambiguously clear" appears four times).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("her pocket holds a single lens from an old 35-millimeter projector") but suffers from repetitive constructions ("She pockets," "She lifts," "She folds") and overuse of "ambiguously clear." The phrase "already spoken" in line 30 contradicts the story's emphasis on gestural communication. Some sentences strain for effect over clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lens-as-decoder device offers fresh functionality beyond typical symbolic use, and the cryptic doodles as confession method shows ingenuity. However, the core reconciliation narrative follows familiar beats, and the crystal's sudden animation feels unearned. The specific detail of "35-millimeter projector" and encoded ticket messages elevate above generic execution.</comment>
