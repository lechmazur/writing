Looking at this story through an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds meaning through layered observations and metaphorical resonance between neutron stars and butterfly decay.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal shift from studying millisecond collapses to understanding gradual decay creates genuine character evolution. The "preprocess reality" trait manifests concretely through her spectral analysis of butterfly dust and measured responses. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "buffering the world to soften its edges" which lacks fuller embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works well, building from damaged greenhouse to butterfly wing to final understanding that "change...was simply continuous." Cost is legible in the decay patterns and lost species. However, the ending truncates mid-sentence ("her"), preventing full closure resolution and suggesting incomplete execution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively shapes Mara's discoveries—shattered glass, torn roof panels, and dripping irrigation all contribute to the decay patterns she studies. The milkweed planter, chrysalis, and bench create a coherent spatial choreography. The storm damage constrains what she can find and how she interprets it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: one wing becomes twelve, forming "a gradient from vivid to ashen." The stake—understanding catastrophic versus gradual change—deepens as Mara recognizes the butterflies "had not died in fire but in retreat." Cost appears in the species' documented decline and her shifted worldview.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the neutron star/butterfly parallel without explicit moralizing. "Decay can be a lullaby" and "change...was simply continuous" arise from concrete observation. The final image of seedlings threading through debris offers resonant hope without sentiment, reweighting the decay narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature filters everything through Mara's scientific lens—"motes that drifted like slow comets," "frequency map." The dialogue to absent butterflies feels authentic to her character. Slight register elevation in places ("kindled humility," "patient arithmetic") occasionally strains against the observational voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "monarch wings once flashed like stained glass." Some abstract phrasing weakens immediacy ("profound changes," "accumulated dust patterns"). The truncated ending and occasional filter constructions ("She believed," "She realized") dull momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The neutron star researcher studying butterfly decay offers genuine freshness—an astrophysicist finding cosmic patterns in greenhouse ruins. The spectral analysis app applied to wing dust and the parallel between stellar and lepidopteran collapse create memorable specificity beyond typical disaster aftermath stories.</comment>
