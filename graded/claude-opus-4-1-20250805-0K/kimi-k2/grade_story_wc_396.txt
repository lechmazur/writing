I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered glimpses and reflections that culminate in a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's calm intuitive gift manifests concretely through her ability to "taste emotions the way others tasted salt," and her final choice to map empathy through the mirrors shows contradictory impulses (duty vs. understanding) acting simultaneously. The cost is visible as she dulls the fragment's cutting edges through use, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing like "warm oil."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Mara transforms the treaty from paper to "living relation" through the mirrors, with visible cost as the fragment dulls and can never show futures again. The accumulative structure coheres as each mirror glimpse builds toward the final harmonics rising from below, though the orientation takes slightly long to establish the full stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard on basalt cliffs with glazed fruit trees creates vivid specificity, and the mirrors function as micro-setting that constrains Mara's choices. The rime-glazed trees rattling approval and ice floes that "cracked and collided" then slow their grinding directly respond to the emotional resolution, though some descriptions like "shadow-laced" remain ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation as each mirror reveals another perspective (wounded child, guilty captain, debating elders), tightening pressure until Mara must act. The stakes crystallize around preventing mutual destruction, with visible cost as the fragment dulls and loses its prophetic power, though the resolution arrives somewhat quickly after the mirror sequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of mapping empathy onto action emerges organically through Mara's mirror-weaving, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of "lanterns made from hollowed fruit, light pooling on the ice like melted stars" offers a non-literal answer about shared vulnerability transcending species boundaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent mythic register with distinctive phrasings like "weighted breath before reply" and "floes ground the orchard to splinters." However, some constructions feel overwrought ("shadow-laced silhouette stretched across the curved wall, dividing and rejoining") and the POV occasionally drifts toward omniscient knowledge of the merfolk's response.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments like "fear pulsing like a second heartbeat" showcase precision, but the prose suffers from density issues with figurative language in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats. Template constructions appear ("First she angled... Then she tilted...") and abstract phrases like "reconstitute the treaty... in living relation" lack concrete immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of using broken seer-glass to create empathetic connection rather than prophecy offers a fresh angle on conflict resolution. The specific synthesis of mirrors as "loom" and fragment as "shuttle" to weave understanding feels both surprising and inevitable, though the setup of merfolk/settler conflict is somewhat familiar.</comment>
