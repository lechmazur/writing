<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to understand story magnetism through color theory is clear and deepens through the donor heart connection to Lira. The final choice to become permeable and carry others' stories shows earned transformation with visible cost—the dissolution of his watchful distance. Internal contradictions between his analytical nature and the heart's emotional urgency create genuine tension throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through layered imagery (wing colors mapping memories, spiral descent into Lira's past). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael accepts permeability over watchfulness, with cost visible in "watchful no longer" and the wing's exhaustion. The spiral journey into memory and return creates coherent pressure toward this crystallization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating tea house on basalt chains above cloudline creates vivid spatial anchoring, while the wing's iridescent blues constrain Kael's investigation method. Setting details like "valley mist curled upward" and "lanterns swaying" integrate with action. The wing functions as micro-setting that directly shapes the journey and charges the final image of "powdered sky."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding story magnetism—escalates through the wing's revelations about Lira's life, forcing Kael to choose between observation and participation. The cost manifests in the wing crumbling, exhausted, and Kael's transformation from watchful to permeable. Pressure coheres through accumulating color-memories that demand increasing engagement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of permeability versus watchfulness, with the wing's colors literally mapping the cost of gathering stories. The final line "to illuminate others, one must first let every borrowed light pass through" resonates without moralizing, earned through Kael's embodied journey. The recurring light/color motif accumulates meaning toward this non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical precision with phrases like "quietly explosive yet utterly silent" and "sun trail: a thread of cerulean that split into violet." POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature evident in color-focused observations. Some elevated diction ("valley-mist wonder," "permeable") occasionally strains but serves the mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose shows strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. However, some abstract phrasing ("magnetize stories," "borrowed heartbreak dye the fabric") and occasional register elevation ("nadir," "iridescent strand") create minor friction without fully obscuring meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of color theory, donor hearts carrying stories, and the morpho wing as memory map creates fresh specificity. The floating tea house setting and the concept of story magnetism through permeability offer non-obvious angles. The transformation from analytical distance to embodied participation feels earned through particular details.</comment>
