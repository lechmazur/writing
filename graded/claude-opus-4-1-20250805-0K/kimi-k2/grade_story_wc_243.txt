I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration where the archivist accepts her role in the covenant's cycle.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist's internal conflict between documenting and participating crystallizes beautifully through embodied details like "her wrist trembling as she wrote" and the locket growing "hot against her sternum." Her final acceptance of becoming "annotation" is earned through accumulated sensory pressure rather than sudden epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as the archivist transforms from observer to participant, with visible cost in her dissolution "becoming annotation." The accumulative structure coheres through walnut-ink imagery and the mother-daughter parallel, though the mystical mechanics occasionally strain clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The jetty functions as more than setting—its transformation from solid to dissolving boards forces the archivist's final choice. Sensory specificity like "walnut tannin draw[ing] out the color of dusk on wet wood" and "roses that smelled of brine and memory" create a lived-in magical realism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from recording to touching the photograph, from observation to feeling the covenant "inside her chest," culminating in her staying as "the jetty lurched." The cost manifests physically as she thins into annotation, though the mystical stakes occasionally feel abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of preservation requiring sacrifice emerges organically through the mother-daughter parallel and the final insight: "The weight of small moments is the weight of water—impossible to hold, necessary to carry." The locket transformation into mirror brilliantly reweights the opening without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through compound constructions like "walnut-ink archivist" and poetic precision: "haunted euphoria," "memory of flight rather than flight itself." The archival register maintains consistency even under pressure, though some passages edge toward purple prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with memorable phrases like "aged backward into absence," though density occasionally tips into overwriting: "sweet with blossom and sharp with the coming storm" plus multiple metaphorical layers in quick succession. Some filter constructions ("She felt," "She saw") dull immediacy in key moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The walnut-ink preservation method and the cyclical covenant create a fresh angle on sacrifice narratives. The specific thirty-seven-year cycle and the image of roses blooming from jetty planks show genuine invention, though the mysterious-woman-by-the-sea has familiar echoes.</comment>
