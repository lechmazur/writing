I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through sensory layering and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the artifact's grief is transformed into bearable song.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's "logically emotional" nature manifests concretely as she calculates frequencies while her heart winces, and her final choice to translate rather than silence grief shows genuine internal contradiction. The crypt keeper functions effectively as pressure but lacks distinct voice or embodied presence beyond symbolic gestures.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from the artifact's weeping through sonic ritual to transformed lullaby, with clear cost (the key's melting, permanent transformation of grief). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira transforms the artifact's dangerous lament into "seeds of quiet joy," though the stakes could be more viscerally felt earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina functions beautifully as both setting and instrument—ice conducting sorrow differently than water, becoming "a throat" and finally "a resonant chamber." Sensory details like "each floe ringing with the low hum of thaw" and the synesthetic "splitting the sunset into audible colors" serve the sonic transformation perfectly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from the artifact's dangerous grief through the ritual's progression to final transformation, with Lira's agency driving each step. The threat that "every throat would drown in salt memory" establishes clear cost, though the middle section could tighten the pressure more viscerally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of grief into bearable song—"protection sometimes means release, not imprisonment." The final image of scattered "seeds of quiet joy" offers a non-literal answer to handling sacred sorrow without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("the fleeting golden sunset like seeds of quiet joy") and consistent perceptual signature focused on sound and vibration. The prose occasionally tips toward purple ("fleshly ethereal glow") but maintains coherent texture throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some overwriting appears ("Colors of amber and bruised peach poured over the floes"). Repetition of "fleeting golden sunset" works as pattern but the phrase "logically emotional" twice feels mechanical rather than purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper as sound engineer dealing with a living sonic artifact transforms the familiar guardian role. The specific solution—using ice's different conductive properties to translate grief—feels earned and non-obvious.</comment>
