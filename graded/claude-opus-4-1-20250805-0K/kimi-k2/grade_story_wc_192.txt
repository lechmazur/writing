I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference**: This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases and patterns build toward a resonant reconfiguration through the transformation of absence into potential.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal journey from severing connections to transforming absence into potential is well-motivated through embodied details like "thin white lines across her wrists" and "a burn on her shoulder." The final choice to walk forward carrying "loaded emptiness" as potential rather than loss shows earned transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively as the sanctuary dissolves and the protagonist understands "every bridge burned had been a door opening somewhere else," transforming absence into potential. The accumulative structure builds through layered imagery of scars, shadows, and burning. However, the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually stated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight" creates atmospheric pressure, with details like "walls scorched black...by the slow erosion of memory" supporting the central metaphor. The doorknocker ring functions as micro-setting, constraining choice when pressed to her sternum. Setting could more actively shape tactics beyond symbolic resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Escalation occurs through accumulation as shadows gather and the protagonist breathes them in, teaching herself "to breathe through absence." The pressure builds from external shadows encroaching to internal transformation. The cost of severed connections is present but could tighten more decisively in the middle section.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "teach suffocating to breathe" and the transformation of destruction into refinement. The final insight that "every bridge burned had been a door opening somewhere else" reweights all prior severing as creation rather than loss, avoiding explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception focused on absence and transformation. Phrases like "not as darkness but as absence made tangible" show distinct texture. Some repetitive constructions ("not as...but as") become noticeable, and occasional abstraction dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery like "starlight pooled like spilled mercury" but suffers from repetitive constructions ("not as...but as" appears multiple times) and abstract phrasing that occasionally obscures concrete action. Several paraphrase loops occur, particularly around the concept of absence becoming presence. Information density is uneven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of a "tender shadow keeper" who teaches through deliberate severance offers fresh perspective on loss and transformation. The specific detail of "linking through scars" as method and the physical manifestation of absence as teachable shadows creates an original synthesis of familiar themes.</comment>
