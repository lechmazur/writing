I'll evaluate this story systematically under the demanding standards of immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases and pattern breaks create meaning through lyric resonance rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The janitor's vulnerability becoming a doorway shows genuine internal contradiction acted in scene, with the final transformation earned through accumulated gestures. His spiritually curious nature manifests through concrete actions like tracing meteor paths with phosphor, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("willing to crack whatever blocks the flow").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively with the station coming alive and the janitor departing to follow another silence, showing clear before/after with felt cost. The accumulative structure coheres well under the textural lens, though the cost could be more visceral—"letting darkness pour in" and "wearing the sky's unfinished story" approach abstraction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The station's brass gears, yellow lantern glass, and meteor seeds create a vivid tactile world that directly shapes the janitor's choices and enables the transformation. The tracking station functions as both setting and character, with environmental details like "domes stood like cracked shells" constraining and enabling action throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating gestures—from placing the glass to tracing meteors to opening himself to darkness—each deepening the dominant stake of communion with abandonment. The meteors' response and transformation into seeds provides meaningful tightening, though the pressure could intensify more sharply between middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of weakness as strength, with the final image of the janitor following another aching silence offering a non-literal answer about purpose found in attending to abandonment. The yellow lantern becoming a heart in the constellation's palm beautifully reweights earlier material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout—"whose name was only a whisper of dust," "the way a held breath still holds a song"—with rhythmic control that modulates beautifully under pressure. The lyric voice maintains consistency while varying cadence, and the purposeful elision (unfinished logbook sentence) pays off thematically.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional abstraction dulls immediacy ("spiritually curious in the way roots are curious about stone"). Strong syntactic variety and vivid imagery like "meteors scratched pale signatures across the black parchment" create propulsion, with minimal scaffold or loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor as spiritual attendant to abandoned places offers a fresh angle on caretaking, with the vulnerability-as-doorway concept feeling earned rather than forced. The synthesis of maintenance work with cosmic loneliness creates something genuinely distinctive, though some metaphysical elements edge toward familiar territory.</comment>
