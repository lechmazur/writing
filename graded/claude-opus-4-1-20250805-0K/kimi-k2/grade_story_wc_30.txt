<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The librarian's contradictory identities (cartographer/mechanic) act simultaneously through the moon's phases, with the final choice to preserve wonder through contradiction earned by prior smelting actions. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around identity shifts that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with the smelting of stories building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the librarian accepts her contradictory nature, creating the pearl that contains all stories. Cost is visible in the "serene exhaustion" and the permanent fusion of gears to spine. The incomplete final sentence weakens closure impact slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tidal atrium's rising/falling water directly constrains the librarian's work window and forces her descent to the smelt-works. Spatial choreography is precise with copper treads, spiral staircase, and water levels creating urgency that shapes the smelting sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation as each smelted story-bead adds to the gear in her chest, with the rising tide creating time pressure that forces faster work. The cost manifests in the physical transformation and the permanent carrying of the furnace within.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of smelting contradictions into preserved wonder—the child who fears/craves cold, the fisherman's impossible city. The final lotus with its paradoxical petals ("I am the wave and the shore") crystallizes the theme without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout with brass joints clicking, stories rustling "like trapped starlings," and the moon's breathing. Voice maintains lyric control even under the time pressure of rising water, with purposeful compression that serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"crucibles glowed with the heat of compressed dawns" combines setting, atmosphere, and conceptual work. No loops or scaffolding, though the incomplete final sentence prevents full excellence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The smelting of stories into beads of preserved wonder offers a fresh synthesis of library/forge imagery. The specific contradictions (breathing underwater, forgetting gravity) and the mechanical-organic fusion create memorable originality without gimmickry.</comment>
