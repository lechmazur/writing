I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds meaning through pattern, repetition, and symbolic resonance rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's grief-driven motivation is embodied through concrete actions (gathering materials, following cryptic instructions) with internal contradiction between skepticism and desperate hope. The final choice to cross shows earned transformation through accumulated ritual, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("geography of loss is a map that folds itself").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she crosses to her brother and receives the cooled bronze—a reversal of the opening's heat that crystallizes the migration's completion with visible cost (cut hands, seared palms). The accumulative structure coheres through the seven-night pattern building to this earned reunion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The signal station's frozen dishes and bronze censer foot function as micro-settings that constrain choices and enable the ritual. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("thin as a paper cut," "cold as melted moonlight"), with the environment actively shaping the protagonist's navigation path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the seven-night accumulation, each cryptic instruction deepening commitment until the moon's dark phase triggers the crucial "build the cradle that rocks backward." The bronze's temperature fluctuations create coherent pressure that forces her stance from passive grief to active construction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of "reverse migration"—not returning bodies but memories, rowing upstream through time. The final image of the bronze passing between siblings reweights the entire ritual as successful navigation through loss without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters the world through grief's lens ("paper cut" moon, "hydraulics failed"). Voice maintains consistency through compressed, image-driven prose that modulates with the moon's phases, though occasional abstractions ("geography of loss") slightly dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The dish trembled, not from hydraulics but from the moon pulling at the bronze's alloyed blood"). Minor paraphrase loops appear ("She crossed, not running, not walking, but drifting") and some abstract phrasing reduces clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of reverse migration as memory retrieval rather than physical return offers genuine freshness, executed through specific ritual details. The seven-night structure with moon phases and cryptic instructions creates an original synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
