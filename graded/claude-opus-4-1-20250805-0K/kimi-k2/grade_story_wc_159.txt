I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through lyric density and pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration where the caretaker's own name stirs within her after preserving Liora's.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The caretaker's motivation to preserve names drives concrete action through the repair sequence, with embodied tension when "her pulse stuttered" at the crack. Her final internal stirring of her own forgotten name creates earned resonance, though the piece relies more on archetypal function than individual personality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from routine care through crisis to resolution, with the repair of Liora's name creating a Resonant Reconfiguration that awakens the caretaker's own buried identity. The cost is felt in "some names are too heavy for a single throat" and the millennium of self-erasure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The opal library functions as both setting and constraint—the caretaker must descend to the "lowest gallery" for the phonograph, and the orchids themselves preserve "extinct feelings." The sensory palette (moonlight "pooled like spilled milk," foxglove's "sweet and poisonous" taste) creates a dreamlike specificity that shapes every action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cracked bamboo tube creates genuine pressure—"without resonance the name would die a second death"—and the caretaker's search for the original sound escalates through multiple attempts. The final cost lies in confronting her own forgotten name, though the resolution feels slightly predetermined by the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete preservation of extinct feelings and forgotten names, culminating in the caretaker's recognition that she too carries a name "too heavy for a single throat." The final image of "the last feeling became the first" offers a non-literal answer about memory and identity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm ("gently systematic rhythm of someone who had memorized every petal and fracture"). The perceptual signature focuses on texture and resonance rather than visual detail, perfectly suited to the otherworldly setting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose maintains high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"She wore gloves of spider silk so thin the orchids seemed to breathe against her palms" establishes both delicacy and animacy. Some figurative density in early passages ("moth with singed wings") but serves the accumulative pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of library-as-museum-of-feelings with the caretaker as nameless guardian offers genuine freshness. The specific detail of "Liora, age seven, laughing at rain" grounds the abstract premise in human particularity, and the risk of sustaining pure lyric mode pays off.</comment>
