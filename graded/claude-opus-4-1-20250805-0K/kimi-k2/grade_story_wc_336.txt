I'll evaluate this story systematically according to the rubric.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece. The story builds through layered imagery and metaphorical weaving rather than causal plot mechanics. The closure arrives through density increase and pattern completion as Arin's sacrifice transforms into the tree.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Arin's motivation to preserve wonder by weaving worlds is clear and embodied through concrete sacrifice. His transformation from pruner to essence-giver shows contradictory impulses (preserve vs. exhaust self) acting simultaneously. The cost—his silvering hands and eventual dissolution—is visceral and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Arin transforms into the braided tree, with visible cost (his body silvering, breath thinning). The accumulative lens holds as imagery layers build to this transformation. Minor orientation friction with the two-world concept initially abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The waterfall parapet setting actively participates—its spray creates prisms, the moss cushions Arin's final rest. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("silver syllables," "velvet moss"). The environment constrains and enables the ritual's completion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation as Arin's weaving demands increasing toll—threads from marrow, silvering hands, thinning breath. The cost is legible and builds under the textural lens. One meaningful deepening occurs as personal sacrifice becomes world-preservation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the weaving metaphor without stating morals. The final image of the braided tree offers a non-literal answer about creation requiring sacrifice. "Wonder's color would outlast the vessel that carried it" resonates without preaching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled lyricism ("fern-lined stones," "dream-tenders"). Perceptual signature maintains throughout—Arin notices in layers and multiplicities. Minor elevated diction ("cambium of dreams") fits the mythic register consistently.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful but occasionally over-figured ("absinthe" sky color, "reciprocal gift"). Some metaphor stacking in peak beats ("wings of dawn and dusk"). Information density high; each sentence advances atmosphere or transformation. Template cadence avoided.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of pruning possibilities across worlds is fresh. The synthesis of horticultural craft with cosmic weaving feels specific. Risk-taking in the lyric density mostly succeeds though occasionally tips toward ornament.</comment>
