<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and specific, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (the fool's mask versus her tactical wisdom). Her final choice to create the warning chart and new constellation is earned through prior causality with visible cost—three drops of blood marking those she saves. The "fool who had never spoken a wise word aloud" creates genuine dramatic irony through the gap between performance and reality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure: Mira's completed chart will expose the conspiracy at dawn, with visible cost in her blood drops and the risk she takes. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, with pattern and symbol building toward the final reweighting where "the future begin[s]." Orientation anchors (observatory, Mira, embroidery task) land early and the causal chain from candle's lean to chart placement is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choices through "listening stone" walls that force Mira's fool disguise. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—the candle's whisper, leaves scraping like "dry wings," the cobalt/copper color scheme. The eternal candle functions as micro-setting that both reveals the conspiracy's timing and validates Mira's work, though some spatial choreography could be clearer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preventing the coup) escalates through the candle's eastward lean revealing the deadline, creating time pressure that drives Mira's frantic unstitching and re-embroidering. Cost is visible in the blood drops and the risk of discovery. The tightening occurs when footsteps approach and she must maintain her disguise while working faster, though the resolution lacks a final test of her deception.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of hidden wisdom disguised as foolishness, with the embroidered chart literalizing how truth can be coded in apparent nonsense. The final image of the "candle flame cradled in an open hand" offers a non-literal answer about protecting truth for future resistance. Subtext operates throughout in the gap between Mira's performance and her actual knowledge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Mira's selective attention to sounds and silences ("unheard stories," "echoed silence"). Voice modulates effectively between her internal tactical thinking and external fool's performance. Some register elevation in phrases like "adjacent possibilities unfolded" creates minor friction with the established voice, and dialogue absence prevents full demonstration of voice range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some overwriting appears ("tongue of fire that never shortened, never smoked, only whispered"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Template cadence appears in "She heard" repetition near the end, and some elevated diction ("resonant reconfiguration") doesn't match Mira's established register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of embroidering conspiracy warnings disguised as star charts while performing foolishness offers a fresh angle on resistance narrative. The specific synthesis of astronomy, needlework, and political intrigue feels non-obvious. The eternal candle as both timekeeper and truth-validator adds originality, though the coup plot itself follows familiar patterns.</comment>
