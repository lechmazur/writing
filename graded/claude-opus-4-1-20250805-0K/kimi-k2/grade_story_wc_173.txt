I'll evaluate this story systematically through each category.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and sensory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lys absorbs the echoes and transforms silence into memory.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lys's motivation as a "chaste courtesan" using withholding as a blade is compelling and specific. Her transformation from trained seducer to memory-keeper is earned through concrete action (unraveling threads, absorbing the prism). The emotional progression from ceremonial reverence to "raw, unguarded curve" shows genuine character change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lys absorbs the prism containing silenced voices. The cost is clear: she carries their weight in her bones, becomes a living repository. The lens holds consistently through sensory accumulation and pattern-building. Minor orientation wobble with "empire's lullaby" concept arriving late without prior grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary as a crystalline lattice storing compressed memories is vivid and essential to the story's mechanism. Snow melting on marble, starlight refracting into "fractured rainbows," and the final dissolution of the sanctuary create a lived-in magical space. The setting literally constrains choice - Lys must work within its architecture of threads and light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal summons to collective liberation as Lys unravels each thread, releasing stored voices. The resistance of the threads "coiling like a serpent" creates genuine tension. The sanctuary's destruction and Lys's absorption of the prism represents meaningful cost, though the empire's response remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of silence from oppression to resistance: "silence, when held too long, becomes a scream." The final image of memories spreading through dreams and sudden recognitions offers a non-literal answer about how suppressed truth persists. The concept of harvesting echoes deepens from extraction to preservation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm that modulates from ceremonial ("slow, deliberate flakes") to urgent (sanctuary shattering). Strong perceptual signature in how Lys experiences the threads as living things. The prose maintains consistency even under peak pressure, though occasional elevated diction ("bodily poetic inscriptions") slightly strains the register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "each one catching the starlight like a shard of glass." Some overwriting in places ("lattice of crystal and silence," "cathedral of light") and repetitive structure in the thread-unraveling sequence. Information density is high but occasionally tips into purple prose. The ending sequence maintains momentum despite dense imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of a courtesan weaponizing chastity to unlock imprisoned memories is genuinely fresh. The synthesis of sensual and sacred, silence and scream, creates non-obvious tensions. The specific detail of memories stored as light-threads and released through "the language of absence" elevates beyond template fantasy.</comment>
