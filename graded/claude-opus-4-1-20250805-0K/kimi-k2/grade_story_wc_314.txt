<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's internal contradiction between logic and wonder drives genuine tension through embodied moments like tears crystallizing and hair falling "like spilled ink." Her final transformation is earned through prior causality with visible cost—dissolving into the starlings' flight. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("touch of wonder") that occasionally replaces embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the alchemist dissolves into light/birds, with visible cost (loss of physical form) and conceptual repricing (logic and intuition unified in flight patterns). The accumulative/textural lens holds through density increases and pattern breaks. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of "the final transformation" which remains somewhat vague despite the concrete ending image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The orchard setting actively constrains choice through its threshold nature and the kaleidoscopic waterfall creates atmosphere. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (glowing fruit "like captured starlight," crystal singing). The environment doesn't fully pressure the choice beyond providing a location for transformation, limiting higher scores.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the alchemist's progression from observation to action to dissolution, with clear cost at each stage. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as patterns intensify (starlings, crystal growth, flame). The transformation's inevitability ("as it had claimed every seeker") slightly reduces agency, though her conscious choice to proceed maintains tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the integration of logic/intuition via the starlings' murmuration as "equations in motion rather than symbols." The final image of birds carrying her essence while "logic and intuition flew side by side" offers resonant closure without stating a moral. The piece earns its wisdom through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled lyric voice and purposeful compression ("auburn hair scattering like embers"). Psychic distance modulates effectively from external observation to deep interiority. Some elevated diction ("murmuration," "lattice") fits the alchemist's educated perspective but occasionally feels overwrought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Deductions for overwrought figurative language in places ("spilled ink," "mortar dissolving into starlight") and some abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy ("touch of wonder still eluded her"). The density of metaphor occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy with natural patterns (starlings as living equations) feels non-obvious yet inevitable. The transformation through dissolution into collective flight offers an original take on transcendence. Some familiar elements (hidden orchard, waterfall) are somewhat stock fantasy settings.</comment>
