<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The recluse's evolution from passive observer to active covenant keeper shows clear motivation through concrete actions (reading strips aloud, translating wax runes). His internal conflict between recording silence and breaking it manifests in embodied choices, particularly when he adds his own strip. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("tranquilly perceptive" reads more as label than embodied perception in places).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through ghost encounters, strip readings, and the spiral pattern discovery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the recluse accepts his role as keeper. The closure shows visible cost (ghosts fading into the spiral, box locking) and transforms the wasteland into a luminous covenant space. Orientation anchors arrive late (recluse's former role as covenant scribe at ~20%), causing minor early drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wasteland setting actively constrains choices through its emptiness (forcing the recluse to read the ruins themselves) and the spiral hive pattern becomes the covenant's physical manifestation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (phantom hum, propolis tears solidifying, thyme-scented smoke). The micro-setting of melted honeycomb forming dark amber runes directly enables the covenant's discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving unspoken words—deepens through accumulation as each ghost adds weight to the box and the recluse discovers the covenant's true nature. The escalation follows the textural lens as density increases from individual ghost encounters to collective transformation. Cost is visible in the ghosts' tears, the box's increasing weight, and their final integration into the spiral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete image system of bees/silence/covenant without explicit moralizing. The final transformation of ghosts into the spiral pattern offers a non-literal answer about how silence can be preserved through witness rather than speech. The recurring motif of unspoken words gains weight through each ghost's specific regret, avoiding abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with selective perception focused on covenant-related details (propolis eyes, amber rivulets, needle holes in canvas). Some filter verb accumulation ("he realized," "he understood") slightly dulls immediacy in middle sections. The perceptual signature of noticing through covenant-keeper's eyes (reading ruins, translating wax) is distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong figurative coherence (bees/honey/amber/wax imagery threads throughout) with purposeful rhythm variation. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers. Deduction for repetitive "ghost" constructions in middle section and some abstract phrasing ("mute eloquence" appears three times). The incomplete final sentence creates intentional suspension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost visibility with beekeeping covenant creates a fresh angle on confession/absolution narratives. The specific detail of propolis tears solidifying into amber and the covenant existing in melted wax patterns shows originality. The transformation of traditional keeper/kept dynamics into a mutual preservation system avoids expected resolution patterns.</comment>
