grade_story_wc_205.txt
I'll evaluate this story systematically according to the rubric.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara transforms from revolutionary/traitor to bridge/gardener.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction between revolutionary past and caretaker present drives authentic choices, particularly her shift from possession to translation. The transformation from covering mirrors in shame to standing before them in hope shows earned character change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional states ("poetically inclined toward elegy") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration where the archaeological dispute dissolves into shared stewardship, with visible cost in Mara confronting her betrayal. The accumulative structure coheres through mirror/time imagery building toward transformation. Deduction for late orientation (the archaeological dispute central conflict isn't clear until paragraph 5) and some causality softness in how quickly the Company enforcers become listeners.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting with visible time ribbons and mirror-filled palace constrains choices throughout - Mara must cover mirrors to avoid confronting her past, the shard's fractures refract possible futures. Vivid sensory details like "bruise-colored ribbon" and "storms of chronal dust" create atmosphere. The environment actively shapes the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (Mara's guilt) through institutional (dispute over the shard) to civilizational (reimagining lost culture). The confrontation with Solenne provides the key turn where "theft" becomes "translation." However, the Company enforcers' transformation happens too easily without sufficient pressure, weakening the final escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of translation vs ownership, culminating in "We were never the owners of time, only its gardeners." The shard's transformation from fragment to whole mirrors Mara's journey from betrayer to bridge. The final poem reweights all prior material without stating a moral, though some passages edge toward the abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic register appropriate to Mara's character ("bruise-colored ribbon," "nacre around grit"). Consistent POV with controlled psychic distance. Dialogue between Mara and Solenne carries subtext effectively. Some register elevation in places ("defunct revolutionary") that occasionally distances from immediate experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery and varied sentence structure, but several issues: redundant phrasing ("dust and silence"/"falling ash"), abstract constructions that could be more concrete ("poetically inclined toward elegy"), and some overwriting in the extended metaphors. The prose achieves moments of beauty but lacks consistent precision. Template phrases like "began to" appear multiple times.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archaeological SF with visible time creates original world. The transformation of mirrors from torment to hope and the concept of "translating" rather than owning artifacts offers genuine insight. The civilization that "measured wealth in moments of shared wonder" provides specific originality, though some elements feel familiar from literary SF.</comment>
