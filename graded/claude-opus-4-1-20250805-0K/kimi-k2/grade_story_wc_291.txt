<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's face-blindness creates genuine constraint that shapes his artistic method and drives the closure's recognition moment. The woman's ambiguity and final gesture of smearing the voids embodies contradictory impulses acting in scene. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("empathy isn't memory") that briefly slips into diagnostic territory, though it's quickly grounded in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the reunited ribbon forms "a perfect circle, midnight blue on one side, blood-red on the other" and Elias recognizes "the single face he could always recognize: the human face." Cost is visible in his tears and the woman's dissolution. Orientation anchors solidly by ~120 words. Minor deduction for the abrupt cutoff that weakens the final beat's resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quarry's "limestone tiers swallowed by mist" and shadow ledge create atmospheric pressure while the ribbon fragment constrains Elias's artistic process. Sensory detail effectively narrows to tactile immediacy ("mist condensed on the back of his neck"). The setting actively shapes the final confrontation and the woman's emergence from fog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Elias paints "negative space around three faces," culminating in the woman's arrival with the matching ribbon fragment. The reunification creates visible cost through tears and dissolution. Stakes deepen when the painted eye triggers the search dogs' convergence, though the truncated ending slightly weakens the final pressure point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the painted convergence of "innocence and guilt, pursuit and escape, memory and oblivion" without explicit moralizing. The ribbon's transformation from fragment to circle elegantly embodies unity of opposites. The line "Empathy isn't memory. It's the moment you decide the stranger's absence hurts as much as your own" resonates though borders on explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Elias's methodical counting and measuring "the distance between cheekbone and grief." POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("lance the silence that had thickened") and the abrupt ending that disrupts established rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of lyric precision ("stone teeth ready to swallow names") but suffers from occasional overwriting and register drift. Template cadence appears in the painting sequence ("First came... Next... Last"). The truncated final sentence creates an artifact that dulls closure momentum, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The face-blind artist investigating through negative space offers fresh perspective on the detective genre. The synthesis of three cold cases into one absence painting feels earned. Some derivative elements (mysterious woman emerging from mist) prevent higher scoring, though the specific execution partially transforms the trope.</comment>
