I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern recognition, recurring motifs (three crows, three circles, three notes), and density shifts that culminate in rekindling the beacon through accumulated coincidences.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's retrocognitive gift creates genuine internal tension between curse and necessity, with embodied details like "colors too bright to bear." Her motivation builds coherently through pattern-following to the earned choice of mending the prism. The vision of her older self adds layered complexity without exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where rekindling the beacon transforms isolation into connection ("other lights flickered awake"). The accumulative lens holds as coincidences cohere into meaning, with visible cost in naming losses at each fracture. "Coincidence had never been random" crystallizes the thematic reversal with earned weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic setting constrains choices effectively through "dunes where cities once stood" and the fused tower-pavilion hybrid. The glass humming pavilion's sonic properties directly enable the prism's repair. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's retrocognitive perspective, though some descriptions lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the shard of hush's threat to "swallow her" and the methodical pressure of aligning fractures with lost names. The dominant stake—proving coincidence has meaning—tightens as each pattern leads to the next necessary step. Cost manifests in binding personal losses to cosmic repair.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of coincidence and intention, crystallizing in "What falls together rises together." The recurring patterns (threes, glass humming, violet light) accumulate meaning without explicit moralizing. The final image of following crows while "carrying nothing but certainty" offers resonant closure to the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("thistle-blown hope," "angles of absence"). POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Some elevated diction ("retrocognitively blessed") occasionally strains against the intimate register, but rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong momentum with purposeful compression, though occasional ornamental phrases ("skeleton lighthouse in a land with no sea") don't fully earn their weight. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative language borders on overwrought but remains comprehensible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic and mystical elements through specific details like "measuring angles of absence instead of light." The retrocognition-as-curse angle and backward-traveling beacon echo show genuine originality. The concept of coincidence as stellar language transforms familiar territory.</comment>
