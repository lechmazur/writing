<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's chronically curious nature drives her return to recover stolen memories, with internal contradiction between her professional cataloging habits and the personal rupture of lost years. The final choice to leave a shard embedded shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("crisp nostalgia") rather than fully embodied states in transitions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (habit breaking, constellation shattering) building to Resonant Reconfiguration where recovered memories return "seasoned by absence." Cost is visible in the shard left as payment and years settling "heavier now." The orientation anchors (greenhouse, Elara, decades later) establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as active setting—its fairy ring mushroom constrains choices as "the ledger" demanding payment, while constellation shards enable memory recovery. Vivid sensory work ("air tasted of cider pressed in 1973") filtered through Elara's folklorist perspective. The drowned orchard and shipwreck ribs create atmospheric pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on recovering stolen decade of memories, with escalation through discovering the mushroom as ledger, then choosing to leave payment rather than take everything back. The dominant stake (memory recovery) tightens when Elara realizes she traded them herself. Cost is legible but the middle section could use sharper pressure between discovery and resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between curiosity and its costs—folklore as "never a gentle thing that never collected debts." The final image of an apple "that had finally learned how to rot" resonates as accepting natural cycles versus perpetual preservation. Strong subtext in the constellation patterns breaking into "question marks."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive folklorist voice with controlled lyricism ("cathedral bell jar," "salt roses") and consistent perceptual signature focused on patterns, cataloging, and folk elements. Minor register elevation in places ("freighted with the crisp nostalgia") slightly above natural POV lexicon but maintains coherence through closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("chronically curious" appears three times, "crisp nostalgia" echoes). Some elevated diction feels forced ("freighted with the crisp nostalgia of cider"). Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple story elements simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore collection with memory-as-currency creates non-obvious angle on Faustian bargains. The constellation shards as "frozen sky" holding bartered memories shows imaginative specificity. Transformation of the apple metaphor from never-rotting to "finally learned how to rot" provides memorable reversal of fairy tale logic.</comment>
