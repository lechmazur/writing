<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The storyteller's motivation to preserve the dying language through translation is clear and drives every action. Her internal conflict between loss and preservation manifests through embodied details like copper veins cooling into filigree. The final choice to walk toward "places where new words were being born" shows earned transformation with visible cost—the language dies but she continues as witness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the language dies but its texture persists in the storyteller's transformed body and the healed diamond. The piece teaches its pattern early (bone towers as syllable monuments) and pays it off when they crumble into "phonetic dust." Cost is visible in the copper veins hardening and the towers collapsing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The canyon setting actively constrains and enables the translation process—the tunnel amplifies sound, moonlight activates the diamond's projection, bone towers resonate like reeds. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "walls slick with the residue of forgotten consonants" creates texture without overwriting. The environment participates in closure when towers crumble into phonetic dust.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as each translated word costs the storyteller physically (copper veins cooling/hardening) while the language's death approaches with sunset. The dominant stake—preserving meaning through translation—tightens when reduced to "a single bird" tracing the final sentence. Cost is legible in the permanent transformation of her body and loss of "ancestral resonance."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of translation—texture becoming sound, death becoming preservation. The final image of the storyteller walking toward "places where new words were being born" offers a non-literal answer about linguistic continuity without moralizing. The healed diamond and transformed copper veins embody the theme that preservation requires transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled lyric register that matches the mythic tone without becoming purple. Perceptual signature strong in passages like "invisible to any eye but hers" and selective attention to texture. Some register elevation in phrases like "quietly articulate" works within the established voice. Clean POV control throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("copper-veined," "bone towers," "phonetic dust"). Some figurative density in early passages but it serves the accumulative pattern. Minor repetition of "quietly articulate" and slight overwriting in "each echo thinner than the last" but momentum remains strong. Information density high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of language death with physical transformation—the copper veins cooling into grammatical filigree is genuinely original. The concept of translating bird murmurations into lost phonemes through a diamond's fracture shows imaginative risk-taking. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat into conventional resolution.</comment>
