I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category systematically.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This story operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens. The narrative builds through layered sensory details, pattern accumulation (water/light/sound motifs), and a cadence shift that reweights meaning rather than through strict causal turns. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's acceptance of waiting and the cyclical nature of departure/return.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's blindness creates genuine constraint that shapes every action through tactile and auditory perception. Her motivation is clear and embodied through specific sensory details. The internal consistency of working by "memory, sound, and the faint warmth of reflected light" holds throughout, though the emotional arc could deepen further at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—Mara's return to waiting after successful repair, accepting the cyclical nature of her role. The accumulative lens holds consistently through water/light/sound patterns. Cost is visible in her acceptance of perpetual waiting, though the final beat could sharpen this price more acutely.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The water basin as micro-setting brilliantly constrains and enables Mara's repair method, making environment essential to plot resolution. Sensory hierarchy perfectly reflects blind POV through sound, warmth, and vibration. The depot's "magnetic calm" and mist create atmospheric pressure throughout, with spatial choreography remaining coherent despite the protagonist's blindness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—rescue team's survival depends on drone repair before ship departure. The Orion's whistle creates genuine time pressure that accelerates Mara's actions. However, the resolution lacks a sharp trade-off; success comes without significant sacrifice beyond accepting her perpetual role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the departure/return cycle and Mara's role as keeper of broken things. The water basin's dual function as tool and metaphor for reading the unseeable resonates without overstatement. The daughter reference adds emotional depth though could be more fully integrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional perceptual signature maintains blind POV through consistent sensory selection—"tiny glassy sighs," "water's mirrored song," following the drone "by the hum alone." Prose rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating during repair and settling into calm acceptance. No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The mist-coated rail depot hummed with the low magnetic calm" establishes setting, atmosphere, and anticipation simultaneously. Some mild repetition of "magnetic calm" and occasional filter constructions ("she knew," "she could hear") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The blind artisan reading light through water refraction offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of disability, craftsmanship, and rescue stakes feels organic rather than assembled. The specific solution method and sensory navigation create memorable particularity.</comment>
