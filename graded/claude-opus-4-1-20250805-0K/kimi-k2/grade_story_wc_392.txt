I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered discoveries and memories toward a resonant reconfiguration where Maya reframes her father's death and her own purpose.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's internal progression from clinical detachment ("watchfully calm") to emotional recognition earns the final choice to reframe preventable deaths. The contradiction between her trained empirical method and emerging personal connection drives authentic tension, particularly when she recognizes her father's burn patterns in the tunnel marks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds through physical discoveries (lantern, compass rose, journal) that reweight Maya's understanding of her father's death. The closure—reframing preventable deaths as "acts of resistance"—lands with clear cost as she abandons Kellerman's methodology. Minor orientation wobble around the Elias Freeman vision slightly softens causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tunnel functions as more than backdrop—its temperature, humidity, and dripping water create atmospheric pressure while the compass rose and hidden alcove constrain Maya's investigation path. The "mineral deposits shaped like fingerprints" and Morse-code drips elevate setting to participant. The final rain "tapped like applause" charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating discoveries that narrow Maya's options: lantern reveals compass rose → burn patterns match father's scars → journal exposes truth → forced choice between Kellerman's method and honoring resistance. The cost crystallizes when she abandons her mentor's "controlling influence" to file a new kind of report.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete discoveries rather than assertion—the underground railroad's freedom paths parallel Maya's liberation from Kellerman's reductive methodology. The final reframing of "preventable deaths as acts of resistance" offers a non-literal answer to questions of agency and sacrifice. "Fortified vulnerability" manifests in accepting both grief and purpose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature tracks through Maya's empirical observations ("four degrees cooler...humidity eighty-nine percent") that gradually give way to emotional recognition. Some filter-verb clustering ("she saw," "she recognized") in the vision sequence dulls immediacy. Voice maintains coherence through pressure, though diction occasionally elevates beyond natural thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the flame caught with a sigh that sounded like a name"). Some overwrought figurative language ("entangling her memories," "sound and light swapping roles") and abstract phrasing ("fortified vulnerability") create occasional opacity. The paraphrase loop around "watchfully calm" and scattered filter verbs reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underground railroad history with contemporary death investigation creates non-obvious resonance. The specific detail of burn scars matching compass rose patterns and the father-as-conductor revelation transform expected historical fiction tropes. Risk-taking in the temporal blurring sequence heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
