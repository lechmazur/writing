<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lucien's transformation from propaganda writer to ethical storyteller drives genuine internal conflict through the puppet performance, with his "uncommonly serene" bearing masking complicity that surfaces in his confession. The audience members show distinct embodied reactions (scarred pilot's tears, singer's mascara streaks) that evolve through participation, though some emotional transitions feel compressed in the final collaborative moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through puppet vignettes toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the audience transforms from passive observers to active story-creators, with visible cost in Lucien's confession about his propaganda past. The final unfinished line "typed code that projected the entire performance onto the dome" suggests amplification but needs completion for full closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The radar dome functions as active setting—its "residual electronics" make the story stick's phrases glow, creating a liminal space between technology and oral tradition. Sensory specificity ("soft ticking of cooling metal," "ozone scent") grounds the post-conflict atmosphere, though the dome's curved walls serve the puppet shadows effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through layered puppet performances that mirror and transform the smugglers/revolutionaries conflict, culminating in audience participation that shifts agency from performer to collective. The tyrant's reversed speech creating "FORGIVENESS" provides the key tightening moment, with cost visible in the pilot's tears and Lucien's vulnerability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the puppet show's exploration of truth, power, and narrative control, with the child-tyrant exchange crystallizing the question "What survives when no one dares to scream?" The ending's shift from solo performance to collaborative creation offers a non-literal answer about ethical storytelling requiring shared vulnerability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV maintains Lucien's urbane register through "courteous nod" and calligraphic imagery, though occasional omniscient slips occur ("letting the ember briefly flare with remembered phrases"). The narrative voice effectively modulates between performance description and interior revelation, particularly in Lucien's confession sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("mascara had streaked like comet tails," "each letter a living vein") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most high-pressure sentences. Some abstract phrasing ("ethical storytelling could reverse the damage words had done") needs more concrete grounding, though the puppet show descriptions maintain strong visual clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fusion of calligraphy, puppetry, and storytelling in a post-conflict radar dome creates an unexpectedly fresh synthesis, with the reversal motif (backward-walking puppet, mirror-script) adding conceptual depth. The collaborative ending transformation feels earned though not entirely surprising given the setup.</comment>
