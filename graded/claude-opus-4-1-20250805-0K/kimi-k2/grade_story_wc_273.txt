<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Alba's serene anger creates a distinctive emotional signature that drives her choices throughout, particularly her decision to step through the doorway without hesitation. The characterization succeeds through embodied details like "her white hair catching the first pale light" and her immunity to panic, though the chronographer's late appearance lacks sufficient setup for his role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with patterns of ink, time, and consciousness building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Alba helps reverse the temporal trap. The closure lands with visible cost—researchers frozen in "eternal terror"—but the final line cuts off mid-sentence, undermining full resolution. Causality holds as Alba's calm allows her to perceive what others couldn't.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment and its sandstone walls create atmospheric pressure, with the ink's uphill flow "against gravity in spirals that hurt to perceive directly" effectively disorienting perception. The setting constrains choices through hidden chambers and temporal doorways, though some spatial choreography becomes unclear during the dimensional transition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from investigating disappearances to understanding temporal manipulation to actively rescuing the trapped researchers. Alba's serene anger enables her unique agency—she can perceive and navigate where others succumbed to terror. The cost manifests in the researchers' "eternal terror" and the effort required to "bring the others back."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme emerges through action: consciousness expands during crisis as "mercy, not malice," with fear creating temporal traps. Alba's final insight that "consciousness could choose its relationship with time" resonates without moralizing, though the cut-off ending prevents full thematic closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV maintains consistency through Alba's tracker perspective with distinctive perceptual details like "feeling the residue of something more than pigment." However, sudden knowledge leaps occur when she "understood then" complex temporal mechanics without sufficient dramatization. The chronographer's dialogue feels functional rather than naturalistic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("Alba + verb" patterns) and overwritten passages like "creating a rhythm that made her chest tighten with recognition." Multiple filter constructions ("she felt," "she saw," "she understood") dull immediacy in crucial beats. The incomplete final sentence creates an artifact that damages closure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The concept of ink recording temporal states during eclipse-induced crisis offers fresh inflection on time dilation. Alba's albino physiology providing immunity to panic-based temporal traps shows specific world-building. However, some elements feel mechanically assembled rather than organically discovered.</comment>
