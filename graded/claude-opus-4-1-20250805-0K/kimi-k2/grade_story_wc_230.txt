<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction between Lira's skepticism and involuntary truthfulness creates genuine internal conflict, particularly when the glass eye triggers "I'm afraid the orchard will fall and I will fall with it." The final choice to plant the eye shows earned agency through accepting vulnerability. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("fractured sound between disbelief and wonder").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira transforms from isolated forager to "caretaker" through planting the glass eye, with visible cost of binding herself to the unstable orchard. The mycorrhizal network accepting the eye creates both literal and metaphorical anchoring. Slight deduction for delayed orientation (ravine location unclear until cave scene) and some causality softness around how the eye actually stabilizes the trees.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hanging orchard as precarious sanctuary constrains every choice—roots retracting from fear, storm-torn branches, flood-scoured gullies all create urgent physical pressure. The glass eye becomes micro-setting that enables the final transformation. Strong sensory work with "metallic scent of lightning and sweeter note of ripe fungus."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: orchard's instability → compulsive truth-telling → discovery of psychological dependency → planting the eye as acceptance of risk. The cost is clear—Lira binds herself to a collapsing place. However, the psychological safety mechanism feels somewhat convenient and lacks fuller dramatization of how fear actually triggers root retraction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus self-deception emerges organically through the glass eye that "could see through any lie except the one a person tells themselves" and Lira's transformation from skeptic to believer. The final image of the eye glowing beneath loam while Lira whispers "voluntary lullabies" beautifully reweights the earlier compulsion. Slight deduction for the somewhat neat resolution of complex trauma.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends scientific precision ("calibrated fingers," "mycorrhizal networks") with lyrical compression ("hanging orchard...survived...in the way a shattered mirror still reflects"). POV remains controlled with clear perceptual signature of a skeptic noting "buried secrets" and "black diamonds of the earth." The prose modulates effectively under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"branches...dangled like nooses" conveys both physical state and psychological threat. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("fragile grace") and one instance of slight overwriting in "fists of wind."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-pandemic trauma with mycological networks and smuggled relics creates non-obvious angle. The empathy virus causing involuntary truthfulness is inventive. The orchard's psychological dependency mechanism, while thematically resonant, feels slightly convenient. Strong commitment to premise without retreat.</comment>
