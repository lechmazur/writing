<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The borrowed astronomer personality creates genuine internal contradiction as she struggles between measured calculation and the dissolving boundaries of transposed emotion. The final choice to reverse the process and accept "unborrowed uncertainty" shows clear cost through the loss of the workshop's reality. Minor deduction for the abstract nature of emotional transposition that occasionally loses embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens dominates with the halo fragment's transformation from pulsing sorrow to cracked glass marking a Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost manifests through the workshop's dissolution and her acceptance of uncertainty over borrowed certainty. Orientation slightly delayed but serves the disorienting effect; the reversal at "She decided to reverse the process" provides decisive agency though the mechanics of emotional transposition remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The topaz workshop functions as more than setting—its walls thin to transparency, floorboards remember and pace, the space dissolves as emotions leak through it. Sensory detail like "metal type clinking like distant constellations collapsing" integrates action with atmosphere. The vanishing stars create temporal pressure though some descriptions lean abstract rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether emotion can be measured and transposed—escalates through the halo's increasing agency (orbiting her wrist), the press printing unbidden, and emotions leaking uncontrolled. The reversal decision carries weight as she sacrifices her controlled experiment for authentic uncertainty. Cost registers through the workshop's dissolution though the emotional mechanics occasionally feel conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox that "empathy transposed was empathy inverted"—the attempt to measure and transfer emotion hollows rather than bridges selves. The final theorem "To measure emotion, first become the distance it travels" resonates without moralizing. The transformation of the halo from cosmic fragment to ordinary glass embodies the acceptance of unmeasurable human feeling over calculated transposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice merges technical printing terminology with cosmic imagery ("chase," "12-point Garamond" alongside "constellations collapsing"). The prose modulates from controlled precision to dissolving boundaries as emotions leak. Perceptual signature strong in lines like "She tasted metal—someone else's courage." No dialogue to evaluate; internal consistency maintained despite reality's dissolution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong moments like "the sentence read 'I was never here,' yet the spacing between letters spelled 'stay'" demonstrate layered craft. Information density high throughout with lines doing multiple jobs. Some abstract phrasing around emotional transposition ("variables of heartbeat and hesitation") and occasional register elevation ("lucid turbulence of absolute dark") that doesn't fully match the POV's technical grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept of a letterpress operator literally printing and transposing human emotions through typography offers genuine originality. The synthesis of printing craft, astronomy, and emotional mathematics creates a unique angle. The reversal—running the press backward to return borrowed emotion—provides an earned surprise that reframes the entire experiment.</comment>
