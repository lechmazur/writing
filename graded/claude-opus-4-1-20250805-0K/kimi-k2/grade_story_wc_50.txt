<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation to "reverse-engineer wonder" and preserve it drives consistent action through angle measurements and mechanical repairs, with the contradiction between rational preservation and living wonder creating genuine tension. The final choice to store wonder "while still alive enough to breathe" carries visible cost—the emptied cavern and departed swallows—though the character's emotional response ("neither happy nor sad") slightly flattens what could be sharper internal conflict at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story operates as an Accumulative/Textural piece where each angle adjustment reveals layered memories that build toward Arlen's final act of preserving wonder at the cost of its natural state. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he stores the reversed timer in his cellar, with clear cost shown through the "empty" cavern and "ordinary winter" that replaces the magical wounded season. The piece teaches its pattern early through the angle/memory correlation and pays it off when the reversed mechanism releases stored echoes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The marble cavern functions as both setting and mechanism, its quartz veins and reflective surfaces enabling the angle-based memory harvesting that drives the story's central action. Specific angles (43°, 31°, 0°) constrain Arlen's choices and the cavern's "harvest of echoes" actively shapes his tactics, while the frost creeping down the tunnel creates time pressure. The final image of the empty cavern "waiting for the next locksmith" charges the ending with the cost of Arlen's preservation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each angle adjustment deepens the emotional stakes—from the duke's warning to personal childhood memories to the final zero-degree infinity mirror. The wounded season's progression from pale sun to frost to healing creates time pressure that forces Arlen's decision. Cost is legible in the escaped swallows and empty cavern, though the piece could strengthen agency by showing more struggle in Arlen's final choice rather than methodical completion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of preserving wonder versus experiencing it emerges through concrete action—Arlen literally trapping echoes in mechanical form—without explicit moralizing. The final image of stored echoes breathing in the dark cellar while the cavern stands empty offers a resonant answer about the cost of rational preservation. The recurring motif of angles and reflections accumulates meaning, particularly when zero degrees creates "infinity eating its own tail," though the piece could push further into the contradiction's implications.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinct lyrical register with controlled metaphorical density ("brass ribs splayed open like a bird that had forgotten how to fly") that serves the accumulative mode. Arlen's "peripherally focused" perception creates a consistent POV signature of indirect observation that matches his character. The voice holds steady through emotional intensification, though occasional elevated diction ("harvest of echoes") slightly exceeds what a locksmith's internal narration might naturally produce.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The marble cavern breathed cold light" establishes setting, atmosphere, and the animate/inanimate tension central to the theme. Sentence variety creates natural rhythm without template patterns, and the prose avoids loops or scaffolding. Minor friction in phrases like "reverse-engineer wonder" which slightly over-abstracts compared to the otherwise concrete imagery, and "peripherally focused" appears three times when variation might strengthen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of mechanically preserving ephemeral wonder through angle-based memory harvesting offers a fresh synthesis of technical and magical elements. The specific detail of angular measurements (43°, 31°, 0°) grounding the fantastical premise shows originality in execution. While the core tension between preservation and experience is familiar, the locksmith-as-archivist angle and the reversed timer mechanism provide sufficient transformation, though the ending's neat filing system feels slightly safe.</comment>
