<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vagrant poet's motivation to preserve and translate sound between generations drives concrete actions throughout, with his method learned from Marseilles creating causal depth. His internal conflict between preserving ephemeral beauty and accepting its transience manifests through embodied gestures like pressing the music box to his ribs and whispering to captured sounds. The final choice to release all sounds and leave creates genuine cost—sacrificing his collection to fulfill his promise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens established through density increase of captured sounds building toward the resonant reconfiguration where released sounds form "a sentence the dunes had waited centuries to hear." The closure lands with visible cost as the poet empties his collection and departs, his footprints erasing. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, and the pattern of capture-and-release teaches itself through action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The feral loft's architecture—broken louvers as throats, rafters that sing, trembling crates—actively shapes the poet's sound-capturing method and constrains his actions. Sensory detail filters through his specific perception: sounds as "minnows through reeds," wax "the color of old piano keys." The dunes' constant shifting and rattling creates environmental pressure that drives the urgency to preserve before erasure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving ephemeral beauty against inevitable erasure—deepens through accumulation as each jar fills with increasingly personal sounds, from gull cry to his own sob. The tightening occurs when uncorking releases transform individual sounds into collective voice, forcing the poet to sacrifice his collection. Cost is legible in the emptied jars and lighter satchel, though agency could be stronger in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of capturing and releasing sounds, never stated but embodied in "I was here, I loved, I vanished, but listen—something remains." The music box's ballerina searching for her lost audience mirrors the poet's role as translator for those who will never meet. The final image of children pausing to hear unexplained sweetness delivers resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout: "dawn's earliest whistle," "splinter of memory," sounds as physical entities that can be captured. Voice modulates effectively from lyrical observation to intimate gesture ("Stay," whispered to frightened sound). Syntax mirrors emotional intensity, lengthening in contemplative moments and compressing during the ritual's climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"coat stitched from discarded playbills" establishes poverty, creativity, and resourcefulness simultaneously. Strong verb choices throughout: "lodged," "braided," "thread." Minor filter verb accumulation ("felt," "understood") in middle section prevents higher score, though rhythm variation supports scene pressure well.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound-preservation in glass jars with intergenerational translation offers genuine freshness, avoiding expected vagrant-poet tropes. The specific method learned from a deaf woman in Marseilles adds unexpected depth. Risk-taking in the lyrical accumulative structure and the metaphysical ending where sounds converse across time elevates beyond safety.</comment>
