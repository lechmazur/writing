I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and symbolic transformation rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's internal contradiction between silence and the need to voice manifests physically through the ghost as "the part of her that had learned silence." The transformation from haunting to harmony lands with earned cost—she dissolves into music to reclaim her voice. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("driftingly alert presence") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: the ghost transforms from haunting to harmony, with Lira's dissolution into music as visible cost. The accumulative pattern builds through pressed flowers encoding unspoken needs, culminating in the ghost's integration. The "between lightning and thunder" frame provides temporal pressure that shapes the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating marble courtyard and memory garden with upward-drifting petals create a dreamlike physics that constrains action—Lira must work within the storm's brief pause. The flower press becomes active setting through its transformation of memory into tangible art. The mist that "curled around her ankles like curious cats" shows lived-in sensory detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through the storm's temporal constraint and the ghost's increasing manifestation, forcing Lira to act "before the moment closes." The cost is visible when she dissolves into music and walks alone afterward, fundamentally altered. The escalation from encoding to painting to singing shows clear intensification under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of articulating the unspoken emerges through concrete action—pressing flowers, painting graffiti, singing the unsayable. The ghost as "the song you stopped singing" resonates without explaining. The final image of pressed flowers left in the air as "needs no longer unspoken" reweights the entire journey without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lyrical voice maintains consistency through musical metaphors ("tinkersong wonder," "melody of hinges and heartbeats") that feel organic to a balladeer's perception. Some moments edge toward purple prose ("translucent child made of static and starlight") but the overall texture supports the dreamlike tone. The voice modulates appropriately with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("driftingly alert presence that flickered"). Some abstract constructions could be more concrete ("the need felt urgent" vs showing urgency). The variation in sentence structure and paragraph length creates good visual rhythm. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of a ghost that is "not a person but a need" offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of music, visual art, and pressed flowers as means of encoding emotion feels non-obvious yet inevitable. The risk of the lyrical, non-realist approach heightens the emotional stakes while maintaining clarity at closure.</comment>
