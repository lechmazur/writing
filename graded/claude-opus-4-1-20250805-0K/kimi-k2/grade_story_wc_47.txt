<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's internal conflict between confronting public pain and seeking private healing drives consistent micro-choices (grafting the rose, pressing palm to metal, waiting for bloom). The cost of choosing growth over direct response lands clearly when she decides to meet her brother "not with accusations but with a single rose petal." Minor deduction for the brother remaining off-page, limiting relationship-as-crucible potential.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens coheres through pattern accumulation (dripping water, moss growth, data-to-garden transformation) building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira transforms digital wounds into living tissue. The cost manifests as "protected vulnerability" and accepting the slow pace of organic healing versus viral immediacy. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned data center setting constrains choices perfectly—Lira must work with decaying tech and organic overgrowth to create her response. The "pattern left by drip of thawing icicles" spelling "forgive" charges the final image. Environment actively participates through "moss pulsed faintly, a slow green heartbeat."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural density as Lira moves from observation to active grafting, with the amber pendant's projection creating a meaningful deepening that reweights her understanding. The cost of choosing slow organic healing over immediate viral response is legible. One point off for the relatively gentle pressure—no active opposition tests her choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the data-to-garden transformation metaphor, with the final image of carrying "the garden's quiet graft within her" offering a non-literal answer about how digital wounds can become living mercy. The rose petal as "proof that even data can become mercy" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through Lira's watchful dreamer lens—she reads code in water patterns, feels "residual current" in dead servers, perceives the bee's "ancient wings beat once, twice, in solidarity." Voice maintains lyric consistency under emotional pressure with controlled rhythm variations.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("honeyed hush" both describes sound and recalls the confession's false sweetness). Some repetitive phrasing around "pattern left by drip of thawing icicles" (appears verbatim three times) and minor scaffold in "She understood then" and "She would wait here until." No loops touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The core synthesis of digital archaeology meeting organic growth feels fresh and inevitable—data servers becoming moss gardens, backup logs transformed into rose grafts. The specific detail of "ports still crusted with salt from evaporated coolant" grounds the fantastical premise. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure heightens resonance (+0.3).</comment>
