<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper's motivation to witness without judgment is consistent and embodied through concrete actions (folding the swan, stepping through obsidian, recording chronicles), with internal tension between preserving and releasing memory. The character's endurance choice at closure—continuing to witness and record as he crumbles—shows earned stasis with visible cost ("crumbling in place"). However, lacks sharp contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the keeper's acceptance feels too settled throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the keeper accepts his own dissolution into the regenerative silence. Cost is visible in "crumbling in place" and "fragrant with histories losing their grip," though the conceptual weight could be sharper. The origami swan constrains his journey method throughout. Orientation anchors (keeper, library, catacombs) establish by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The obsidian cube and origami swan function as micro-settings that constrain the keeper's journey method and charge the final image. Vivid sensory work ("dust thick with forgotten tongues," "stone sweated") filtered through the keeper's temporal perspective. The decaying library pressures his final acceptance, with environment directly shaping the closure stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witnessing change without judgment versus dissolution) signals early and deepens through accumulative pressure as the keeper releases seasons into silence. The tension between preserving and releasing tightens once when he must fold moments back into the swan before it stiffens. However, lacks a sharp reversal or decisive tightening that forecloses options; the keeper's agency remains observational rather than decisional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of regenerative silence versus preservation emerges through concrete images (swan's creases, dissolving frost patterns, composting syllables) without explicit moralizing. The final image of the swan's "next crease beginning to wake" while the keeper crumbles offers a non-literal answer about cycles of memory and forgetting. Strong accumulative resonance through the repeated fold/unfold motif.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with lyric compression ("earless dark hummed—not sound, but absence quickening"). Controlled modulation from contemplative to visionary during the obsidian sequence. Some register elevation in peak moments ("lethe in which forgetting becomes fertile ground") slightly exceeds the keeper's established lexicon but remains purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Swan met lantern, origami angles flared"). Strong rhythm variation and syntactic variety. However, some figurative density in the vision sequence ("cities bloom and wither inside dewdrops caught on fern fronds that were also his own eyelashes") borders on overwriting without clear pattern-teaching. Minor scaffold in "The ink dried; the vines did not read" sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-organism with time-folding through origami creates a non-obvious angle on memory preservation. The specific detail of using paper folds to navigate temporal corridors while the keeper himself crumbles transforms the expected chronicle-keeper archetype. Risk-taking in the lyric vision sequence heightens stakes though occasionally obscures clarity.</comment>
