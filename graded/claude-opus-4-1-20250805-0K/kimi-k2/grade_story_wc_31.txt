<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miren's motivation to discover the color of sound tied to her drowned mother creates clear, consistent drive through embodied grief and sensory pursuit. The final choice to release the key tag and share her discovery shows earned transformation with visible cost. Internal contradiction between hiding her true purpose and pursuing her vow adds depth, though some emotional transitions could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Miren's discovery reweights all prior sounds and her relationship to the drowned. The final image of her striking the lamp to release the color-sound creates visible transformation with clear cost (releasing the key, ending her solitary quest). Who/where/when anchored early through "late-shift pier lamplighter" and "sky lantern release."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sunken library constrains Miren's search to low tide, while the key tag functions as both tool and setting element that shapes her methodology. Vivid sensory detail ("phosphorescent trails of jellyfish drifting through shattered stained glass") filtered through Miren's synesthetic perception. The drowned hotel and submerged library create a lived-in underwater world that directly enables the closure discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each sound-color brings Miren closer to but not quite matching the chord from the night of drowning. The constraint of "before the last lantern burned out" creates temporal pressure. Cost becomes visible when she releases the key tag and transforms from solitary seeker to community witness, though middle development could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete pursuit of synesthesia as a way to process grief and connection to the dead. The final revelation that "the color of sound was the shade of her mother's voice saying her name" transforms the search from abstract to deeply personal without stating a moral. The piece earns its wisdom through specific sensory experience rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Miren's synesthetic experience where sounds have colors and textures. Voice maintains lyric consistency with purposeful compression ("meteor hush," "luminous vow"). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance that deepens during the underwater descent. Some filter verbs in middle sections slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("each paper bloom drifting upward like a slow meteor hush" establishes setting, tone, and thematic echo). Prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks. Minor repetition of "wandered purposefully" and occasional filter verbs ("she thought," "remembering") create slight drag but don't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Synesthesia as literal quest for processing grief offers fresh angle on loss narrative. The specific synthesis of drowned library, sound-as-color, and maternal connection feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and surreal underwater setting heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
