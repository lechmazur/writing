<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lila's internal conflict between loyalty to her criminal father and moral exhaustion drives authentic choices, particularly her calculated manipulation of the director through the ink pot's "scent of iron and violet." The final choice to carry the ink pot "as both inheritance and evidence" crystallizes her acceptance of complicity with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens builds through layered imagery (formaldehyde/lilies, ink as guilt, death/life duets) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lila accepts that "fairness was not a number but a process." The closure lands with felt cost as she walks in "borrowed shoes" of false condolences, though the moral calculus could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prep room's sensory details (formaldehyde/lilies, porcelain table, overhead light fracturing in ink) effectively constrain choices and create pressure. The ink pot functions as micro-setting that enables the forgery, though some details feel ornamental rather than essential to the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating pressure: from waiting for the director, to the moment of suspicion ("eyes to paper cuts"), to exploiting the "momentary eclipse of vigilance," culminating in the irrevocable stamp. The cost is legible in Lila's acceptance of complicity and her future disappearance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The central theme of moral mathematics ("one death equals one life, plus the ink of forgiveness") emerges through concrete actions rather than statements. The final image of dawn "spilling pale ink across the city" resonantly reweights the entire forgery as a "continuous revision of borders both national and personal."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice weaves metaphoric perception ("eyes to paper cuts," "click like a vertebra") with Lila's measured calculation. The controlled rhythm accelerates during the forgery sequence, though occasional overwriting ("deathly vitality") slightly dulls precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity, but figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("liquefies rigid thinking," "moral ledger scribbled crookedly"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("one death equals one life" restated as "fair trade"), and filter verbs accumulate in reflection passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forgery, identity, and moral debt through the specific detail of using a dead dissident's corpse to fake the forger's death. The ink pot as repository of "every promise her father broke" offers genuine particularity, though some metaphors feel strained.</comment>
