<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's compassion-driven refusal to abandon temporal refugees establishes clear motivation, with internal conflict between exile and duty dramatized through concrete actions like sketching and following the compass. The transformation from "pariah" to "navigator" carries visible cost through isolation and temporal risk, though some emotional transitions (grief to exploration) feel slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where sketching compresses timelines and frees Captain Lys. The cost is legible—trading linear time for connection—and the compass rose becoming a "second heart" charges the final image. Minor orientation wobble around "temporal refugees" initially unclear, but the pattern teaches itself and pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observation deck functions as active setting where "time stretched thinnest" constrains choices and the compass rose serves as micro-setting that enables resolution. Sensory details like "frost that had never melted" and "photon's journey into centuries" embody the dilation's effects. The environment directly shapes tactics through relativistic gradients that must be navigated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through deepening understanding: confusion → exploration → active intervention, with the threshold decision crystallizing stakes. The cost of "trading exile for eternal hesitation" is explicit, and sketching as solution emerges from established family custom rather than convenience. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of transforming confusion into exploration emerges through action, with the compass finding "true north as direction of will, not geography." The recurring sketching tradition gains meaning through use, though the shift from mourning to exploration could develop more gradually. Final image of compass as "second heart" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled diction ("blessed pariah," "echoed silence") and consistent POV. Some elevated register moments ("relativistic gradients," "sediment") slightly strain the established voice. Perceptual signature strong in how time distortion is noticed, though occasional filter phrases ("I realized," "I understood") dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. However, several abstract phrases weaken precision: "confusion pooling like ink," "memory rather than prison," and mild repetition of "echoed silence." The "sediment" metaphor for layered sketches works well. Some sentences in the middle section could compress for momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on time dilation with sketching as temporal bridge between dilated timelines. The concept of navigating fractured time through art feels specific, though the resolution mechanism (sketching to compress time) borders on convenient. The "compass finding will instead of geography" offers genuine conceptual innovation.</comment>
