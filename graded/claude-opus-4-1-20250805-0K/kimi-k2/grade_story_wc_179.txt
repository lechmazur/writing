<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's transformation from "scheming pacifist" harboring resentment to one who releases her own grudges is earned through concrete action—touching soldiers to transfer cellular memory of lullabies. The contradiction between pacifism and scheming drives authentic internal conflict. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("shifting grace") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lira becomes part of the sanctuary's "velvet lungs," her death transforming into continuation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as reality shifts layer with the sanctuary's evolving purpose. Cost is visible in her aging within the hush and final breath becoming a stored note. Slight deduction for orientation taking until line 3 to anchor the museum theft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sanctuary functions as active setting that "peels open a seam of light" and learns Lira's vow, constraining her choices to silence and touch. Vivid sensory work: "walls like cooled ash," "battlefield where soldiers stood frozen mid-charge, rifles blooming into poppies." The evolving garden and transforming battlefield ground the abstract concepts effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from silencing war drums to releasing personal resentment to transforming an entire battlefield. The pin's transformation from broken to whole to seed shows meaningful deepening. Cost is legible in Lira aging within the sanctuary and soldiers' "resentment draining like spilled wine."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the pin as "the wound that taught the knife to rust"—violence transforming into healing without stated moral. The final image of Lira's breath stored in the sanctuary's lungs while a child understands through touch perfectly reweights the opening's "soundless sanctuary." Subtext operates through silence itself becoming the carrier of memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "streets liquefying into ribbons of color, buildings breathing like accordions." POV remains stable in close third. Some register elevation in phrases like "shifting grace" and "cellular memory" that occasionally drift from embodied perception, though they're pattern-taught and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong figurative control with "velvet lungs," "metallic shrug," "origami cranes that flew without flapping." Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Deduction for repetitive use of "shifting grace" (5 instances) and "cellular memory" (4 instances) creating mild template cadence, though they serve thematic accumulation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The conceit of a pacifist using a broken music box pin to transform war through silence is fresh. The sanctuary as a place "where grief turned to pollen" offers non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in the lyrical compression and reality-shifting frame heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
