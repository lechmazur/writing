I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through sensory layers and metaphorical accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the mapmaker realizes she's been mapping herself.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete sensory details (palm to bark, vibrations as ink). The internal journey from seeking external stillpoints to recognizing self-mapping shows genuine transformation with visible cost - she releases her role as mapmaker to become "a living chart." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "uncharted emotional depths" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the realization "she had been mapping herself all along" - a genuine reconceptualization with felt cost as she transforms from mapmaker to living chart. The accumulative structure coheres well through sensory layering. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of "uncharted emotional depths" which takes time to ground in concrete terms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest functions brilliantly as both setting and sensory apparatus, with trees as tuning forks and vibrations as language. The quartz trunks, mercury-pooled starlight, and moss-as-braille create a vivid, purposeful sensorium that directly enables the protagonist's journey. The environment constrains and shapes every choice through its unique physics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding/naming emotional depths) escalates through accumulating sensory languages toward the stillpoint discovery. The cost manifests as transformation from mapmaker to map itself. However, the escalation relies more on deepening recognition than active pressure, and the "grief" naming feels slightly unearned without more specific grounding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the journey from external to internal mapping, with the final image of becoming "a living chart" offering a non-literal answer about self-knowledge. The recurring compass/navigation metaphor gains depth as it shifts from physical to emotional terrain. The piece resists easy morals while maintaining thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("colors had folded themselves into a single dark chord"). The synesthetic perception and musical/tactile language create a unique POV signature. Some moments edge toward purple prose ("quiet blaze of determination") but generally maintain purposeful compression and pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("uncharted emotional depths," "quiet blaze of determination") and some overwriting in metaphorical density reduce clarity. The filter verb "felt" appears frequently. Line-level craft is competent but occasionally strains for effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of blindness, synesthetic perception, and cartographic metaphor creates a genuinely fresh angle on self-discovery. The concept of absorbing languages through skin and the platinum compass that points inward show inventive world-building. The risk of sustaining this lyrical, sensory-heavy mode pays off with a resonant closure.</comment>
