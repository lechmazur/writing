I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category against publishability standards.

**Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causality, with density increasing toward a resonant reconfiguration where Calen crosses into "branching dawns."

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Calen's internal contradiction between withdrawal and compulsion to fulfill his oath manifests through embodied details like "gauntleted fingers trembling with shivering bliss." The merger with the puppet creates genuine cost through identity dissolution. Minor deduction for the convenience of perfectly-timed memory recovery about the child queen.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Calen crosses the threshold into "branching dawns," having merged with the puppet to fulfill his oath. The accumulative lens holds throughout with increasing density of magical imagery. Cost is visible in the identity merger ("no longer alone inside his armor"). Slight opacity in the exact nature of the transformation prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse constrains and enables the transformation - silver sap becomes the binding cords, glass melts to release new reality. Sensory details like "cedar and old greasepaint" and "dusted lavender and rusted wire" create specificity. The environment literally transforms Calen, making it essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation follows accumulative pattern: discovery leads to recognition, then puppet animation, memory recovery, and finally merger. The dominant stake (fulfilling the forgotten oath) deepens through each beat. Cost manifests in the irreversible transformation where "the boundary between knight and effigy dissolving."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of performance/authenticity, memory/forgetting, and withdrawal/commitment without explicit statement. The marionette theater as "rehearsal for moments when reality grows thin" offers resonant metaphor. The ending reweights the opening "murmured allegiance" from burden to "dancing, finally, in the open air."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with consistent elevated register appropriate to fantasy ("phosphor-apples," "runic loops"). Strong perceptual signature in how Calen notices theatrical and alchemical details. Minor syntactic monotony in some descriptive passages ("rows of dwarf pomegranate trees bled..." follows similar structure to other lines).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("petals of light peeling from the fruit to orbit the scene"). Information density high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. Some overwriting in metaphor density during peak moments ("gravity loosening like a slackened string" amid other figurative language). Template cadence appears briefly in middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of puppet theater, alchemical transformation, and knightly oath creates fresh territory. The concept of theatrical rehearsal for reality-stitching moments feels genuinely novel. Risk-taking in the surreal transformation sequence pays off through maintained coherence. The specific detail of "unsnap" gesture linking desertion to transformation shows originality.</comment>
