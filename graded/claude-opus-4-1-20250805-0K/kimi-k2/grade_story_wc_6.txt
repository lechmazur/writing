I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and symbolic resonance rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's characterization achieves depth through embodied contradiction - the arsonist's daughter who fights fire, carrying her trauma as talisman. The transfer of the coin to the boy demonstrates earned compassion through specific action. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract final insight about compassion that edges toward therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Mara's act of passing the coin and creating the sand birds - a transformation of trauma into gift. The accumulative structure coheres, building from personal wound to shared healing. Deduction for the incomplete final sentence and slightly abstract realization about compassion that weakens the otherwise strong closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and volcanic black sand function as more than setting - they embody the story's central metaphor of transformation. "Each grain carried flecks of obsidian, tiny mirrors that caught the shifting sky and returned it fractured" exemplifies how setting constrains perception and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation operates through accumulative deepening - from solitary reflection to encounter with the child to shared creation of sand birds. The stakes shift from personal reckoning to transmitted healing. The pressure remains gentle but coherent under the textural lens, though it lacks a sharper edge of cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete imagery - lava becoming soil, scars that sing, fire transformed to breath. The story resists explicit moralizing until "compassion was not the absence of pain but the art of shaping it" - this edges too close to thesis statement. The sand birds as vessels of transformed trauma work beautifully.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception. "Voice soft as kelp-drift peace" and similar constructions fit the accumulative mode. The POV holds steady, filtering everything through Mara's specific trauma-informed perception. Minor register elevation in places but serves the piece's aims.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty - "each one holding a pocket of air that whistled when the wind passed through." Some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("blessing them with the residue of old fires"). The incomplete final sentence and occasional elevated diction ("harmonize with the wind") create minor friction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of firefighter-as-arsonist's-daughter offers genuine complexity, avoiding simple redemption narrative. The sand birds as whistling vessels of transformed trauma feels earned and specific. The piece commits to its lyric mode without retreat, though some imagery feels familiar within literary tradition.</comment>
