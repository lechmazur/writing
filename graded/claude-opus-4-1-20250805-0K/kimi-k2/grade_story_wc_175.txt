<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to honor overlooked histories is clear and consistent throughout, driving concrete actions like building the semaphore tower and tying the moth wing at its apex. The final choice to leave the red thread as "a vein of intention" shows layered internal conflict between permanence and transience, with visible cost in accepting the grotto's forgetting. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around memory and commemoration that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration - the moth wing catching starlight "like a blush on the cheek of the world" reweights all prior gestures of remembrance. Cost is legible in Lira's acceptance of her own erasure ("the grotto had accepted her offering and begun its slow forgetting"). The piece teaches its pattern of temporary monuments early and pays it off through the tower's gradual dissolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto functions as more than setting - its transiently rooted nature ("islands of soil clung to the caldera's lip") directly constrains Lira's choices, forcing temporary rather than permanent structures. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (orchids like chandeliers, mist pooling like breath), with the environment actively participating through vine rustles and the grotto's "exhale." The moth wing's shadow revealing an erased city elevates setting to thematic instrument.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving overlooked histories deepens through the monarch's torn wing becoming the moth wing memorial, with meaningful tightening when Lira must accept three-day dissolution. Cost is visible in the physical constraint of impermanence and emotional price of "embarrassment at her own need to commemorate." The tension between remembering and forgetting escalates through concrete choices rather than abstract meditation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the moth wing's transformation from debris to monument to shadow-map of an erased city. The "interrupted cadence" concept resonates through the monarch's flight pattern, the tower's musical rest shape, and Lira's incomplete memorial. The ending offers a non-literal answer about memory's persistence in smaller spaces without moralizing, achieving genuine complexity about commemoration versus erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout - Lira notices through the lens of an "esoteric realist" seeing semaphore alphabets in bamboo crossings and forgotten forests in wing scales. Voice maintains consistent lyrical precision with controlled rhythm that tightens during the candle-lit revelation. Minor compression of diction under emotional peaks ("tears blurred her vision, not of grief but of recognition") stays within established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs - "islands of soil clung to the caldera's lip, anchored by vines that could release their grip at any sigh of the mountain" establishes setting, constraint, and metaphor simultaneously. Some elevated diction in places ("verdant grotto," "translucent moth wing") but serves the meditative tone. Clean prose rhythm with varied sentence lengths creating visual breathing room.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of migration narrative with memory preservation, avoiding expected eco-disaster or extinction angles. The moth wing as accidental monument and the semaphore tower spelling "remember" show specific invention. The grotto's agency in forgetting and the red thread as bureaucratic archive material repurposed as lifeline demonstrate thoughtful transformation of materials.</comment>
