I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - The story builds through resonant images and transformations rather than strict causality, with density shifts and pattern breaks reweighting meaning.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pilgrim and clairvoyant exhibit clear, contradictory motivations (seeking vs. knowing) with embodied emotional progression through tears, trembling, and physical reaching. The transformation from certainty to wonder ("I didn't see this") carries genuine cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "unseen forces" and "overlapping shadows" that occasionally drift toward conceptual summary rather than embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the clairvoyant's gift transforms from burden to wonder, with visible cost in his tears and admission of limitation. The accumulative structure coheres through the pearl's transformation (white→black→crystal) and the cave's metamorphosis. Slight deduction for the middle section's abstract handling of "unseen forces" as "ordinary choices stacked like sediment" which momentarily breaks the mythic register.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The musical crystal cave functions as both setting and active participant, transforming from cathedral to throat to archways while constraining choices through its song and spatial shifts. Vivid sensory work: "tones glittering overhead while the floor drank all light," "ribs," "vast throat." The cave's physical properties directly shape the narrative arc and charge the final violet-tinged dawn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: the pearl's transformation, multiplication of selves, and the cave's morphing intensify stakes. The clairvoyant's loss of foresight and the pilgrim's confrontation with accumulated darkness create genuine tension. Cost is visible in tears, physical dissolution ("fingers passed through"), and the final admission of not seeing the outcome.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of sight/blindness, everyday magic/darkness, and the transformative power of uncertainty. The grocery-list lullaby and morning bread steam ground abstract concepts in lived detail. The ending reweights "steadily unpredictable" from threat to promise without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled mythic register and purposeful compression ("Sound became mirror, mirror became gate"). Strong perceptual signature in how the pilgrim notices resonance while the clairvoyant tracks futures. Deduction for occasional register drift into abstract philosophical territory ("ordinary choices stacked like sediment") that momentarily breaks the fable-like texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied rhythm, but several issues: repetitive "overlapping shadows" appears three times; abstract phrasing around "unseen forces inhabit" lacks concrete embodiment; some simultaneity confusion in the transformation sequences. The ending maintains momentum but the final line cuts off mid-sentence, suggesting incompleteness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pilgrimage narrative with failed prophecy, transforming the clairvoyant archetype through specific vulnerability. The cave-as-instrument and pearl-as-catalyst offer non-obvious angles. The "bright darkness" paradox is earned through concrete imagery rather than mere juxtaposition, though some middle passages lean toward familiar spiritual journey territory.</comment>
