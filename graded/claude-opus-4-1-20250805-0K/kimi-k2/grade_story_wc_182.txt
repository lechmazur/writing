I'll evaluate this story systematically under the demanding editorial standards.

**Drive Lens:** Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant with Causal elements). The story accumulates metaphysical layers through the bookstore's transformation, with causal linkages in Elara's negotiation sequence.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from knowledge-preserver to garden-librarian shows genuine character arc with embodied cost (staying behind). Internal conflict between saving static knowledge versus creating living wisdom drives meaningful choice. Slight deduction for abstract philosophical moments that lean toward concept over embodied emotion in middle sections.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the library transforms into a living garden, with Elara's sacrifice (staying to tend it) as visible cost. The hybrid lens holds consistently through accumulative botanical imagery and causal negotiation beats. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some abstract middle passages.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore as DNA helixes/geological strata creates vivid, constraining environment that shapes every choice. The transformation to terraced garden charges the final image powerfully. Botanical diary's pressed flowers becoming actual seeds shows exceptional object-as-setting integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from rescue mission to fundamental renegotiation of humanity's relationship with knowledge. The guardian's demand for proof creates genuine pressure. Cost is clear in Elara's decision to stay. Slight deduction for abstract philosophical negotiation that could use more visceral tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of living versus static knowledge emerges organically through the botanical metaphor and library transformation. The final image of visitors coming "not to read but to listen, to tend" offers resonant answer without moralizing. The botanist's final quote enriches without explaining.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct voice with arcane linguistic expertise coloring perception ("unheard symphony of displaced time"). Some register elevation in philosophical passages strains against more grounded botanical imagery. POV remains stable but occasionally drifts toward omniscient summary ("Years pass in moments").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("shelves spiraling upward like DNA helixes"). Several abstract philosophical passages slow momentum ("negotiation—a living contract between what humanity remembers and what it chooses to forget"). Some repetitive structures in middle sections ("She begins by... She spends... She discovers...").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of library, time travel, and botanical elements into coherent living-knowledge concept. The transformation from static repository to growing garden shows genuine innovation. Risk-taking in the metaphysical negotiation sequence pays off at closure (+0.3 within band).</comment>
