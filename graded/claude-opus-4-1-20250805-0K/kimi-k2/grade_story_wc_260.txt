<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between trust and betrayal manifests through concrete actions—reconstructing the tail while processing fraud—with embodied emotion ("fragile convictions tremble"). The transformation from naive trust to "tensile, like spider silk after rain" is earned through specific micro-choices, though some interior passages edge toward over-articulation ("the layer that believed every promise, the layer that equated kindness with naivety").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered metaphors of reconstruction and shedding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara achieves "tensile" strength and opens the door carrying the incubator, with visible cost in accepting "righteous action could coexist with regret." The orientation anchors clearly (Mara, workshop, after fraud revealed) and causality holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The workshop setting actively constrains choices through available materials ("regenerative matrices," bio-gel) and the skylight framing stars creates atmospheric pressure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"cedar shavings and iodine," "microscopic scales catching starlight like shattered opal"—with the reconstructed tail serving as micro-setting that charges the final image when carried forward.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering from betrayal while maintaining compassion—escalates through the reconstruction process that forces Mara to shed protective layers. The tightening occurs when she must "balance self-respect and compassion" by reporting the crime while protecting the chameleons, with visible cost in accepting she cannot save all the lost ones.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of reconstruction and regeneration, avoiding explicit moralizing. The recurring imagery of layers, shedding, and rebuilding creates resonance without stating lessons. The final image of carrying the incubator into dawn while "a single star refusing to fade" offers a non-literal answer about persistence through betrayal, though some passages approach thematic echo ("life was merchandise").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains a lyrical, contemplative register appropriate to Mara's gentle nature, with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("mist clung to her lashes, turning the workshop into a soft-edged dream"). Some passages show repetitive syntactic patterns ("She lifted... She breathed... She set...") and occasional register drift into elevated diction ("freighted with betrayal") that slightly exceeds the POV's established range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments of compression and imagery but suffers from template cadence runs ("She lifted... She breathed... She set... She opened... She calibrated...") and some overwriting in figurative density. Information density is uneven, with some paraphrase loops around the betrayal concept. The writing achieves clarity but lacks consistent propulsion, particularly in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise of healing through literal reconstruction while processing betrayal offers a fresh synthesis of physical and emotional recovery. The specific detail of chameleon stem cells and bio-gel creates authenticity. However, the resolution trends toward expected emotional territory without significant risk-taking, and some metaphors (shedding layers) feel familiar rather than transformed.</comment>
