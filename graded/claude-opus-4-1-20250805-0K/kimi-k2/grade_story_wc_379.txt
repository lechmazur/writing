<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as curator-listener is clear and embodied through concrete actions (pressing palm to iron, kneeling to listen). The internal drive to "follow the sound the way she followed the frayed hem" shows consistent character-specific perception. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient alignment of her curatorial skills with the mystical resolution, though the cost of collective grief is visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and neighborhood stories braid toward the closure's Resonant Reconfiguration—the courtyard exhaling as collective grief transforms to healing. The locket's return opens the mailbox, revealing letters that name hidden losses, with visible emotional cost ("tears cutting clean paths"). Orientation anchors clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The courtyard setting constrains and enables key choices—the sandstorm creates temporal pressure while the courtyard's "uncannily still" air allows Mira to hear. Sensory hierarchy reflects her curator's perception ("pulse of every chipped saucer"). The mailbox's physical transformation and the rosemary's "scent sharp enough to cut through dust" directly shape action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from hearing the rattle to feeling vibration to discovering the locket to the public reading. The sandstorm's curfew sirens create external pressure at the crucial moment. Cost is legible in the collective tears and twenty years of suppressed grief, though agency could be stronger at the peak moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of listening as healing—not stated but enacted through Mira's method. The final image of the locket as "artifact to its rightful exhibit" reweights the entire narrative, proving "listening—like dawn—can heal what force alone cannot." The letters naming every silence creates resonant specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout ("curator who could feel the pulse"). Prose modulates effectively from the mystical ("heartbeat muffled by years") to the documentary (reading Lila's letter). Minor deduction for slight register elevation in "cancerous silence" that doesn't fully match Mira's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("sandstorm had blown in overnight, draping the sky in muted amber"). Sentence variety creates natural rhythm. Deduction for two instances of slight overwriting: "cancerous silence" and "rinsed and ringing" push figurative density without full payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mystical mailbox premise offers a fresh angle on collective trauma, though the resolution through a magical locket trends toward convenient. Strong specificity in the twenty-year timeline and draft letter concealment. The synthesis of thrift store curator with community healer shows originality but doesn't fully transform the healing-through-revelation template.</comment>
