<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to preserve memory through ash and porcelain reads clearly, with embodied grief in "temples throb like the last pulse of the old chair." However, the emotional progression relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("six hundred possible futures") rather than concrete contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to remove the mask arrives without sufficient causal buildup of internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the mask's removal, but closure lacks visible cost—she "laid it reverently" without consequence. The orientation remains deliberately vague past 120 words without clear payoff at closure (-0.3 applied). The final image of "vanishing point accepted this too" provides resonance but no decisive change or reconfiguration with legible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gallery setting with "corridors became perspective vanishing into charcoal nothing" creates atmospheric pressure, and the mask's porcelain shards physically cut her cheeks, constraining choice. The rocking chair's rhythm reverberating "within her ribs" effectively uses micro-setting. However, the vanishing point gallery remains more metaphorical than physical, limiting its ability to shape concrete tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving or releasing memory of the dead lover—is signaled early through the charcoal portrait. One meaningful deepening occurs when "little embers stirred, glowing like dying stars inside cracks," but this doesn't foreclose options or extract visible cost. The mask's removal lacks agency-driven consequence; she simply takes it off "no longer needing its shield" without trade-off or price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of incomplete information versus understanding emerges through the mask's "mirage of safety" and culminates in "safety revealed itself mirage." The recurring ash/porcelain imagery accumulates meaning, particularly when tears mix with soot. However, the final paragraph's explicit statement "proving a memory could be both wound and suture" edges toward thematic summary rather than earned resonance through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistency with controlled rhythm in "Each black flake carried a fragment of an expression neither of them had ever dared to utter aloud." POV remains stable in close third. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("zero gravity of forever") that strains against the intimate grief scenario, and no distinct perceptual signature emerges beyond generic poetic observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("ashy petals," "dark pearls") but suffers from density overload—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern-teaching (-0.5 applied). Template cadence appears in "She felt...She reached up...She lifted" structure. Abstract phrases like "lucid grief" and "somber marvel muted the scene" create opacity in peak beats rather than concrete propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of gallery-as-psychological-space with physical mask-making from lover's portrait ash offers a non-obvious angle on grief work. The image of filling porcelain cracks with charcoal ash while whispering lies transforms the expected memorial narrative. Risk-taking through the surreal curator figure and vanishing perspective heightens conceptual stakes, though execution occasionally muddles rather than clarifies.</comment>
