<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Octavia's motivation to disprove her father's orbital shame is clear and consistent, with embodied details like thumbing the rosewood nib and tasting "meteorite justice." The mathematical proof as emotional resolution shows character-specific problem-solving. However, the journalist remains underdeveloped as mere witness, and some emotional transitions (moist eyes to feeling "oddly light") lack intermediate embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Octavia's mathematical proof causing the satellite's destruction at 4:09, with visible cost in her moist eyes and the realization that "regret might scatter into smaller fragments." The accumulative/textural lens holds as details build toward the satellite's burn. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of "orbits of regret" that occasionally obscures concrete stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The observatory setting actively constrains and enables Octavia's intervention—she can observe but not physically reach the satellite, forcing the mathematical solution. Vivid details like "vaulted stone throat answered each tiny motion with an operatic sigh" and "stones picked up pink echoes" create atmosphere while the telescope becomes the tool through which change occurs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from the journalist's urgent question through Octavia's discovery of the satellite to its destruction, with meaningful deepening when she realizes smaller fragments remain. The mathematical proof as intervention shows agency under constraint. Cost is visible in emotional moments but could be more visceral—the "orbit of shame" remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of orbital mechanics representing cyclical shame, with the mathematical proof offering a non-literal answer about confronting legacy. The rosewood nib's history (belonging to the journalist who exposed her father) adds ironic layers. The ending's discovery of smaller fragments resists tidy resolution, suggesting trauma's persistence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with phrases like "moonlight rings the valley peaks like brass fittings on an old ship's wheel" and consistent elevated register fitting an heiress who thinks in mathematical proofs. Voice modulates effectively from contemplative to urgent to quietly triumphant. Minor moments of overwriting ("airy suspension of a skeptical pause") don't touch closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of overwriting: "airy suspension of a skeptical pause," "telescopic orbits of regret," "elegant violence of thought." Some metaphor density in non-peak moments ("starlight stitched silver footprints") without clear payoff. The mathematical proof sequence and closure remain clear and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomical observation with family scandal creates an original premise—using mathematical proof to destroy an orbiting confession. The specific detail of the rosewood nib from the exposing journalist adds memorable irony. The concept of shame as literal satellite broadcasting confession is inventive, though occasionally relies on abstraction.</comment>
