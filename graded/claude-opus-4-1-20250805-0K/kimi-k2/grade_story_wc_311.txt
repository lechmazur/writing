I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and symbolic resonance rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The reaper's heartbreak manifests through concrete, embodied details—"hollow where his own heart used to beat," fingers trembling at recovered names. His motivation to name and forgive drives every action, culminating in the earned transformation where crystallized names become "second heartbeats." Minor deduction for the slightly abstract handling of the loved one's departure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the reaper transforms from "heartbroken" to "no longer entirely heartbroken," with visible cost paid through accepting the names into his hollow chest. The accumulative structure coheres beautifully as each discovered name builds toward this transformation. Slight opacity in the exact nature of his past sacrifice prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting actively constrains and enables—broken prism shards become the tool for revelation, the dome's decay mirrors the reaper's state. Exquisite sensory work: "frost that had never known a living footstep," "smell of brine and lullabies." The setting transforms from place of loss to benediction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each crystallized name adds weight, narrowing from general sacrifice to specific losses. The cost manifests physically as names sink "cold and bright as starlight" into his chest cavity. The transformation from fear to love ("sea beasts had never been beasts at all") creates meaningful reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of monsters into sacrifices, fear into love. The central insight—"to name was to forgive"—earns its resonance through concrete action. The final image of the reaper carrying "distant intimacy like a lantern" perfectly reweights all prior material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "constellations wheeled like slow clock hands." POV maintains consistent mythic-intimate register. Perceptual signature strong—the reaper notices through loss and memory. Minor compression at emotional peaks ("small, rueful, alive") works within established pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose density high with lines doing multiple jobs—"echo of sacrifice trembled in the rafters" establishes atmosphere while advancing theme. Some figurative density in places ("frost ferns," "starlight swallowed by a well") but serves the accumulative mode. Minor scaffold in "he understood" construction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exceptional synthesis of reaper-as-namer rather than taker, transforming the death-figure trope through specific emotional truth. The conceptual originality of monsters as compressed sacrifices feels both surprising and inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and incomplete final sentence heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
