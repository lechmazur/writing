<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The oracle's obsession drives concrete actions throughout—climbing, mapping silences, tearing her sleeve for the legend—with embodied detail like "mildly obsessed heartbeat" and "trembling legs." The final choice to release the star shows agency with clear cost (darkness falls absolute), though internal contradiction could be sharper during the mapping sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through catalogued silences building to the star's extinction—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the oracle completes her map as darkness falls. Cost is visible: "Darkness fell absolute" after she releases the last star, and the future traveler will "weep where the line thinned to nothing."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fort's physical details constrain movement ("slick step," "grinding shale") and the "ambered hush" functions as quasi-setting that "thickened" and "contracted." Sensory hierarchy reflects the oracle's purpose—she perceives silences as textures with "velvet dark" and "marbled" qualities that shape her mapping choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating silence-types from simple (thunderclap pause) to ancient (predating language), with the final dot spreading to black as decisive deepening. The oracle's agency drives each catalogued silence, and releasing the star shows clear trade-off: completing the map requires accepting endless night.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of mapping absence—making silence legible for future travelers. The ending reweights all prior mapping as preparation for guiding others through darkness, with the traveler who will "pause where the spiral tightened" showing how absence becomes navigation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—the oracle experiences silence as physical textures ("scrape of absence," "velvet dark") and the prose rhythm modulates from measured observation to urgency as "her mildly obsessed fingers moved faster." Lyric compression serves the accumulative design without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Wind clawed the parapet, yet an ambered hush clung"), though some metaphor density in early passages ("like resin around a fossilized bee") slightly slows momentum. The final incomplete sentence "folding itself into" works as purposeful truncation but risks feeling unfinished rather than resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle-as-cartographer mapping negative space, with the specific innovation of translating silence types into topographical notation. The concept of creating a navigation guide for "endless night" transforms the oracle trope through concrete, non-obvious execution.</comment>
