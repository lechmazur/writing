I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Luma's ghostly altruism drives consistent motivation through watering rituals and chalk messages, with concrete embodied details like "spectral fingers guiding a stub of white chalk." The ensemble cast (Kiran, mechanic, twins, archivist) applies meaningful pressure through their specialized skills during the nebula-threading climax. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("hope tangled with thorns of doubt") rather than fully embodied contradiction in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught chalk messages building to collective action. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Luma dissolves into the bell, becoming "perpetual dew" with visible cost (her ghostly existence ends). The orientation anchors (Orchard Planet, floating arches, ghost status) establish cleanly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the truncated ending "Years later, Kiran—now" which slightly weakens the final beat's resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating rock arches function as both setting and constraint—they crack and threaten collapse, forcing urgent action. Vivid sensory detail like "midnight-blue fruit blossoms" and "nebula of respite...like a lavender cloud" creates atmosphere while the watering bell becomes micro-setting that constrains choices. The silver irrigation threads woven through arches directly shape the climactic solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the planet before arches collapse) escalates through accumulating pressure: ghost's limitations → Kiran finds bell → others emerge → collective weaving under time pressure. The seven-dawn timeline creates urgency with visible cost when Luma sacrifices her ghostly form. Stakes deepen rather than reverse, fitting the Accumulative lens well.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the arc from isolation to community: "strangers became family under the same drifting stone bridges." The final chalked message "Family is the orchard we choose to tend together" resonates without moralizing because it's earned through dramatized collective action. The recurring bell and chalk motifs constrain choices and charge the closure when Luma becomes the bell's essence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance, shifting focus from Luma to Kiran smoothly. Distinct perceptual signatures emerge (ghost's translucent perspective, child's wonder, mechanic's calculations). Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction drift ("nebula of respite," "brambled hope") and the abrupt truncation that disrupts final rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for register drift into elevated/poetic diction that occasionally obscures clarity ("brambled hope," "slow-motion waterfall"), some filter-verb clustering ("decided to reexamine"), and the incomplete final sentence that breaks momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ghost-as-community-builder premise offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic restoration, with specific details like chalk messages and the butterfly garden bell. The synthesis of altruistic haunting with ecological restoration feels organic. Limited by the somewhat predictable arc of isolation-to-community and missing opportunity for deeper complexity in the truncated ending.</comment>
