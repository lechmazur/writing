I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds density through rose imagery, sand/canvas fragments, and the concept of "engraved quiet" toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lila offers the rose as a transmission of continuity.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lila's pacifist stance amid violence shows clear motivation through concrete actions (offering the rose instead of weapons, grafting cuttings with deliberate calm). Her internal conflict between father's legacy and her own values manifests in embodied moments. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("continuity through chaos") that could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lila offers the rose and the boy flees with it, crystallizing her method of resistance through cultivation rather than violence. The "engraved quiet shift[ing] into something new—not silence, but a listening" provides conceptual cost. Accumulative structure coheres through rose/sand/memory patterns building to this transformed transmission.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass dome functions as both sanctuary and pressure-container, with specific details (trembling panes, spiderweb cracks, geothermal heart) constraining choices. The roses growing from repurposed airship sandbags creates layered history. The dome's fragility against external violence shapes every decision, particularly the service hatch moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal safety to ideological transmission as scavengers circle and breach the dome. The boy's arrival forces Lila's decisive choice between violence and her pacifist methods. Cost appears in the cracking dome and the risk of offering peace to potential threat, though the immediate consequence could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the cultivation metaphor—growing memory and quiet as resistance to violence. The roses-from-sandbags image elegantly reweights military materials into growth. The final "listening" versus "silence" distinction offers genuine complexity about how peace persists through active engagement rather than passive withdrawal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical control with purposeful compression ("crimson as cooling embers," "tranquil blaze"). POV stays firmly with Lila's sensory hypersensitivity. Some elevated diction ("inculcating plants with values") occasionally strains against naturalism but serves the piece's heightened register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("pocket universe where every thorn was a promise") but suffers from occasional abstraction and repetitive structures. Some filter-heavy passages ("she imagined," "she reminded herself") and conceptual redundancy around memory/continuity themes dilute immediacy. The ending's shift to present tense feels unmotivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The pacifist-daughter-of-bounty-hunter premise offers fresh tension, and the roses-as-resistance-through-cultivation angle transforms expected post-apocalyptic violence tropes. The specific detail of roses growing from military sandbags creates original texture. The quiet ending that transmits ideology through a flower rather than confrontation shows genuine risk-taking.</comment>
