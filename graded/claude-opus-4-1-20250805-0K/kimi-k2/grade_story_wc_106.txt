<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The thief's transformation from stealing to releasing portraits shows clear internal conflict acted out through concrete choices, with the jar's weight serving as embodied emotional state. The final renunciation carries visible cost as she abandons her method and identity. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("luminous disbelief") that occasionally replaces embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with the jar filling with stolen moments until the decisive release creates a Resonant Reconfiguration—the thief reinterprets herself from one who steals beauty to one who can bear it. Cost is visible in the emptying of her "pockets heavy with stolen light" and the abandonment of her craft. The destiny door opening "wide enough to step through" charges the final transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald station's green-fractured moonlight creates specific visual texture that the thief navigates to steal portraits, making setting functional to her method. The jar warming "like a second heartbeat" and boots "silent on dew-slick tiles" ground us in tactile detail. The great clock frozen then resuming marks temporal stakes and transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual portrait theft to the accumulation in the jar becoming "heavy with stolen radiance," forcing the choice between keeping or releasing. The moonflower code system creates concrete pressure as she must evade the guard. Cost appears in releasing what she's gathered, though the middle lacks a sharp tightening moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of stealing then releasing light—beauty cannot be possessed without destroying it. The final image of her vanishing into "luminous disbelief of ordinary dawn" resonantly answers whether stolen moments can be kept. The moonflower spiral code "I have seen what cannot be kept, and I release it" crystallizes theme through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "pockets heavy with stolen light," "destiny's door creaked open a finger's width." The perceptual signature of cataloguing faces and translating light into portraits shows character-specific noticing. Some elevated diction ("luminous disbelief") occasionally strains but rhythm supports the accumulative structure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong moments like "the jar pulsed, heavy with stolen radiance" show good compression. However, several abstract phrases dilute momentum: "reinterpret memory itself," "luminous disbelief" appears three times. The "quietly savvy" repetition and some elevated register ("architecture of timetables and farewells") create mild density issues without harming closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The portrait thief who releases rather than keeps her stolen moments offers a fresh angle on possession and beauty. The flower-code system and jar of moonbeams create specific world-logic. The transformation from thief to one who releases is earned through accumulated particulars, though some elements feel ornamental.</comment>
