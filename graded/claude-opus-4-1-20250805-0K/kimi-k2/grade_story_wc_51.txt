I'll evaluate this story through the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern rather than causal progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fractal weaver's motivation crystallizes through embodied burden-gathering and the physical transformation of grief into bronze and stone. The calcification sequence shows contradictory impulses (holding vs. releasing) acting simultaneously, though some emotional transitions feel abstractly labeled ("black sphere") rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the weaver transfers human burdens to bronze and stone, with visible cost in her own calcification. The accumulative structure coheres through the burden-sorting sequence, though the village backstory arrives late without earlier grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bronze grotto functions as active constraint, trapping the weaver until burdens balance, while its oxidized ribs and "whalebone reverie" walls mirror her internal state. Sensory detail layers effectively (drip of snowmelt, blue flame, shingled hush) and the environment directly shapes her transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the burden hierarchy (small to medium to largest), with the village avalanche failure as apex weight. The protagonist's agency manifests in the ritual sorting and acceptance of calcification, though the resolution's ease slightly undercuts the established trap.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of emotional weight into physical substance, avoiding abstraction. The final image of the grotto as "vessel now full" that keeps weights "it would never again let fall on human shoulders" offers resonant answer to burden-bearing without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency through compound constructions ("boundary-lessly trapped," "shingled hush") and selective perception focused on weight and texture. The rhythmic control during the calcification sequence is particularly strong, though occasional register elevation ("whalebone reverie") slightly exceeds the established range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs (memory as mass "pressing against her collarbones like wet wool"). Some figurative density in peak moments borders on overwriting ("frost feathers," "whalebone reverie," "bronze grotto" in close succession), and "boundary-lessly" reads as forced compound.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The conceit of physical burden-sorting through calcification offers fresh angle on grief processing. The specific fusion of kerosene lamp with maritime imagery ("drowned ship," "whalebone") creates distinctive atmosphere, though the village avalanche backstory follows familiar disaster-survivor patterns.</comment>
