<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gravity defier's internal contradiction between weightlessness and the desire to land drives genuine complexity, with the tablet-hurling choice earning its cost through established causality. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("labyrinth of self") but embodied details like "boots hovering inches above wet stone" and the visceral "rush of blood and memory" when gravity returns anchor the characterization strongly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change as protagonist destroys the tablet to break the retracing loop, with visible cost in surrendering her gravity-defying power ("feet settle on the floor, gravity claiming her at last"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as procedural generation intensifies through architectural morphing until the algorithm fails, forcing the choice. Orientation anchors solidly by line 2 with character, setting, and situation clear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The viaduct's procedural generation from "Gothic arch" to "brutalist concrete" to "coral lattice" creates vivid spatial pressure that constrains movement. The recurring tablet and its physical destruction serve as micro-setting that enables the final choice. Setting evolution directly mirrors internal state ("city that existed only in the negative space of her regrets").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through algorithmic degradation—from infinite variation to "running out of variations, looping the same cracked marble"—forcing confrontation with the unchangeable (mother's death). The cost manifests physically as gravity returns "in a rush of blood and memory" and psychologically as she abandons the compulsion to undo. One meaningful deepening that forecloses the path of endless retracing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete realization "The labyrinth is not outside you; it is the hollow where your heart should be" paid off by destroying the tablet. The final image of the "widening circle of now" resonantly answers the opening's "moment between the drop and the ripple" without stating a moral. Minor deduction for one instance of abstract phrasing but overall theme arises from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "dying stars," "glass breaking in reverse," and the controlled rhythm acceleration as the viaduct fails. Some elevated diction ("periodically eternal," "Fractured Timelines") fits the speculative register. Minor repetition in structural patterns mid-story but voice remains coherent through the pressure sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful fragments ("Behind her, the labyrinth dissolved"). Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for abstract phrases like "labyrinth of self" and "negative space of her regrets" that lean conceptual rather than concrete, plus minor repetitive stems in the middle third ("She had," "She kept").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-loop and architectural generation creates non-obvious stakes—the labyrinth as internal void rather than external maze. The "procedural generation" failing and forcing authentic choice transforms a familiar concept. Specific details like "seventh heartbeat" reset and "liquid light" warnings avoid generic execution.</comment>
