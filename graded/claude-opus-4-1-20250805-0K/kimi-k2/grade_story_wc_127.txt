<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vale's internal contradiction between professional detachment and emerging vulnerability drives a meaningful transformation with visible cost. The final choice to take the buyer's hand represents earned renunciation of distance, though some emotional labeling ("professionally thorough horror") slightly dulls embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through sensory detail and emotional density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Vale loses "the privilege of distance." The cost is felt through the dissolution of her counterfeit skins and the raw ache that replaces detachment. Minor orientation wobble with the buyer's gender shift (silhouette to woman) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber grotto's resinous walls that hum with emotion constrain the transaction and charge the final dissolution. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("air itself seemed to glow like molten resin"), though the space could more actively shape tactical choices beyond atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through static electricity intensifying to violet filament binding, with Vale's defenses progressively dissolving under accumulative pressure. The reversal when the buyer refuses the product and asks for Vale's survival formula creates meaningful tightening, though the final convergence feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of counterfeit emotions versus authentic connection, with the blotter petal serving as a physical anchor for absorption and overflow. The final insight about losing "the privilege of distance" resonates without moralizing, earned through the specific exchange of grief over a brother lost to war.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Vale's clinical cataloging voice modulates effectively when her detachment fractures. Some register drift into elevated diction ("subsumes the client's native defenses") and occasional filter-verb clustering slightly compromise immediacy, though the voice maintains coherent texture through the transformation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("dusk's last light dripped like honey"), but several instances of abstract emotional labeling and mild redundancy ("felt her own counterfeit skins begin to slough" follows similar phrasing). The recurring "professionally thorough" creates intentional pattern but borders on mechanical repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The counterfeit emotion dealer premise offers fresh conceptual territory, particularly the idea of stolen, repackaged grief being recognized by its original owner. The transformation from dealer to vulnerable human feels earned, though the resolution trends toward expected emotional convergence rather than surprising insight.</comment>
