<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to understand trust breaking after losing their brother creates compelling internal contradiction between scientific pursuit and grief. The choice to leave the device as monument rather than warning shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Interiority is concrete through synesthetic perception, though some emotional transitions feel slightly compressed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout with the mosaic assembly accumulating toward a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist chooses witness over warning. The brother's memory provides the decisive reweighting that transforms understanding. Cost is visible in leaving the device behind and walking away with diminished synesthesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drowned greenhouse with iron ribs and shipwrecks creates a vivid post-apocalyptic seascape that constrains movement and supplies materials. Synesthetic perception (colors carrying sound) filters every sensory detail through the protagonist's damaged cochlea. The underwater orchard blooming at closure charges the final image with renewal despite betrayal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating absences into the mosaic until the brother's memory triggers recognition of trust's true sound—not crack but hush. The protagonist's renunciation of the device carries clear cost. Stakes deepen appropriately for the textural mode though physical pressure remains minimal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of designing silence to hear betrayal, culminating in the orchard's message of persistence despite loss. The device becoming monument rather than tool offers resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates beautifully through the synesthetic translations and the brother's seashell memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through cross-wired synesthesia creates unique voice where "orange hummed like distant trumpet." Lyric compression and patterned imagery serve the accumulative mode perfectly. No dialogue maintains appropriate isolation while prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dense, purposeful prose with lines doing multiple jobs—"cells divided in pips caught between salt and soil." Some metaphoric density in middle sections ("collecting absences the way a shell gathers absence of sea") occasionally slows momentum. Strong control of rhythm and imagery throughout with clean grammar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synesthetic hearing-aid designer crafting silence from absence offers genuinely fresh angle on grief and betrayal. Post-flood underwater orchard with biological time creates original world-logic. Risk-taking through lyric accumulation and the choice of witness over warning elevates the piece.</comment>
