I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and symbolic resonance rather than strict causality, accumulating toward a moment of shared understanding and healing.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode inscriptions drives clear choices, and her gift of healing through witnessed words creates genuine internal tension. The shared burden with Corin feels earned through specific grief (his sister's loss), though some emotional transitions happen too smoothly without sufficient resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the telegram transforms into a seed for future healing, with visible cost (surrendering their heaviest burdens). The accumulative structure coheres well through the variable stars motif and shared witnessing, though the temple materialization stretches credibility slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting with its brass orrery and spectrograph lens constrains choices effectively, particularly when aligning the daylily with Betelgeuse. The dream-temple's transformation from stone to memory enriches the thematic weight, and spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal decoding to shared healing, with the temple demanding payment as meaningful cost. The progression from isolated chronicling to witnessed burden-sharing creates genuine pressure, though the transformation happens somewhat smoothly without sufficient resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of shared burdens emerges organically through concrete action - the telegram between them "like a fragile treaty," names becoming stars, the temple as stored memory. The final seed image resonates without stating its moral, effectively reweighting the opening's solitary approach.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("understanding dawns like a slow tide"), though occasional register elevation ("irised open") slightly exceeds the POV's established range. Dialogue feels natural and advances the emotional arc, particularly Corin's revelation about naming what you carry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative imagery, though some metaphoric density in peak beats ("night poured in, thick as ink") and occasional template structures ("She understood then"). The final incomplete sentence reads as intentional but disrupts momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream chronicling with astronomical observation creates an original frame for exploring grief and healing. The specific combination of variable stars as message-carriers and the daylily telegram as living document transforms familiar elements, though the temple materialization feels slightly convenient.</comment>
