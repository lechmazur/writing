I'll evaluate this story systematically according to the rubric.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through sensory layering and pattern accumulation, building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the dog accepts the wasteland's "wild hush as a lullaby rather than a warning."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bloodhound's transformation from grave-mapper to memory-seeker is earned through concrete sensory discoveries ("tobacco caught in a grate," "pine needles compressed under a winter coat"). Internal contradiction manifests beautifully in the dog's simultaneous desire to "press distance into a single reassuring heartbeat" while accepting separation. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in the middle sections that briefly loses embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the dog accepting "paths that no longer need bodies to prove they exist" - a genuine foreclosure of his original purpose with visible cost. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details layer into revelation. Orientation anchors clearly (bloodhound, wasteland settlement, post-war). Minor deduction for slight causality softness in how the cylinder's grooves translate to forest projections.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The wasteland setting actively constrains choices - "earth empty of secrets worth exhuming," forcing new forms of discovery. Exceptional sensory hierarchy reflects the dog's professional priorities ("scent of lacquer and dying oak—impossible"). The preserved leaf and cylinder grooves function as micro-settings that enable the central transformation. Setting details evolve causally as perception shifts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation reads as density increase appropriate to the accumulative lens - from catching impossible scents to hearing his name to seeing the lost child. The dominant stake (translating distance into closeness) deepens through each sensory revelation. Cost is legible in accepting that memory replaces physical presence. Slightly softer middle section where pressure plateaus briefly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between preservation (amber leaf, wax cylinders) and destruction (wasteland, slag). The final image of cylinders as "secret texts lulled by moths and metal" offers a non-literal answer about how beauty survives through transformation. No moralizing; complexity preserved in the acceptance of loss alongside discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout - the dog experiences the world through professional scent-mapping translated to new purposes. Prose rhythm modulates effectively from the sparse opening to the dense middle revelations. Minor inconsistency in register when the dog "becomes intuitively descriptive" - slight POV stretch for a canine consciousness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Old tin roofs click like teeth when the heat expands them toward noon"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful rhythm changes. Deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("amplified silence," "unintelligible sighs") and one instance of slight redundancy in the cylinder description passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with memory-as-archaeology concept. The specific innovation of reading history from cylinder grooves while a dog translates scent into memory shows genuine originality. Risk-taking in the lyric mode and canine POV heightens stakes. Slight deduction for familiar wasteland tropes in the opening.</comment>
