I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric with precision.

**Drive Lens Identified:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern, imagery, and symbolic resonance rather than strict causality, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where father and daughter reunite through earned understanding.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Iona's "featherly determined" trait manifests through concrete actions - tracing wood grain, decoding weather symbols, stepping onto the glass rail. The father-daughter reunion carries genuine emotional weight with the revelation that her name was the final symbol, though some interior passages lean toward abstraction ("distances inside her chest aligning").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres well - from terrace observation through grain analysis to maze descent and reunion. The closure lands with emotional cost (three harvests of separation) and the weather code revelation reweights prior material. Minor orientation wobble in the opening but recovers; the "butterfly effect" causality could be clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace and corn maze create vivid, constraining environments that shape Iona's choices. Sensory details like "glass floor creaking," "corn silk," and light "scattered like shattered butterflies" ground the fantastical elements. The grain patterns in furniture meaningfully advance the plot rather than merely decorating.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes build through Iona's analysis and risk-taking descent from terrace to maze floor. The dominant stake (reuniting with father/understanding sacred thresholds) tightens when she steps onto the glass rail. Cost is visible in the three-harvest separation, though the maze's convenient opening after the weather code recitation feels slightly unearned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of "necessary distances" and "sacred thresholds" emerges organically through concrete details - the grain's doorway knot, the bent corn stalk, the father's lesson about pilgrimage. The final image of them sanding together while "the grain sang of thresholds no longer feared but welcomed" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with phrases like "featherly determined" and "fractured hush." The lyrical voice suits the fantastical premise, though occasional register elevation ("sacred thresholds are not crossed; they are earned") slightly exceeds Iona's child perspective. Dialogue feels natural when it appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative imagery and varied sentence structure. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("distances inside her chest aligning with the distances outside") and repetitive phrasing around "sacred thresholds" and "necessary distances." The "shattered butterflies" image effectively ties to the butterfly effect concept.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The fusion of aviation (pilot logbook, airship terrace) with agrarian maze architecture creates fresh juxtaposition. The weather code as emotional cipher and the grain-reading method for understanding thresholds show genuine ingenuity. The butterfly effect as maze-transformer adds conceptual originality.</comment>
