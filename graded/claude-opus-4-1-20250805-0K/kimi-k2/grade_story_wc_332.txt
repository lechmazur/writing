<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The librarian's motivation emerges through embodied details (palette "strapped like a compass across her heart") and contradictory impulses between cataloguing absence and vitalizing dreams. The dream-child's transformation from fog to flesh with "hollow" eyes creates genuine cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("luminous absence") that occasionally replaces embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the librarian accepting her shadowless state while the dream-child gains substance. Cost is visible through traded shadow and the child's departure with the palette. The cipher/map device and sunrise photography method cohere well, though the opening could anchor location more concretely.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archipelago functions as active setting through "bridges of mist" and phosphorescent foam that enable the dream-child's movement. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (iron and lilac taste, liquid gold in palette wells). The environment constrains choice through the easternmost jetty positioning and black basalt terrain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: dry wells flooding with light, fog thickening to flesh, the librarian trading shadow for spectrum. The dominant stake (vitalizing the runaway dream) tightens when she must give the palette itself away. Cost is legible in her shadowless state and the dream's permanent departure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "vitalizing" requiring release rather than capture. The recurring "luminous absence" transforms from hollow to lantern, reweighting the entire pursuit. The final image of the child painting "the path home with footprints of dawn" offers resonant answer without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through synesthetic details ("words tasted of iron and lilac") and selective attention to light/color. Lyric compression serves the accumulative design well. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("hush of improbable beginnings") that slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("watercolor palette strapped like a compass across her heart"). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("thin auroras dripping from her brush like liquid memory") without clear payoff. Template repetition in "She [verb]" constructions appears but doesn't dominate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of librarian-as-light-hunter with dream-tending creates memorable premise. The sunrise photography method and painting directly onto air show genuine innovation. Risk-taking through lyric structure and the paradoxical resolution (giving away the tool of capture) heightens stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
