<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dual Kaels and their relationship to the brain create a compelling trinity of consciousness exploring numbness vs. feeling. However, character particularity suffers from conceptual abstraction—"corporate shaman who engineered his own ego death" reads as premise label rather than embodied presence. The final choice to breathe life together shows clear motivation, though the path there relies on symbolic gestures over concrete psychological complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as the three entities form "a circuit of mutual recognition," transforming custody battle into shared stewardship with visible emotional cost ("tears return, salt stinging like thaw"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through micro-memories, shared breathing, and rain imagery. Minor orientation debt: the relationship between Kael and Kael-2's divergence point remains vague, though this doesn't break closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating dojo above "rewritten Pacific" while "history rewrites itself" creates a compelling temporal sanctuary that shapes the entire conflict. Sensory specificity shines in "tatami mats glowing with residual chronal heat" and "cerebrospinal fluid spilled across the tatami." The setting constrains choice—the dojo's stability depends on "reclaimed emotion"—directly charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on defeating mutual numbness through custody of consciousness, with one meaningful deepening when both realize "the numbness was mutual." The practice blade "honed to cut arguments rather than flesh" provides textural pressure rather than reversal. Cost becomes visible when tears and laughter return, though escalation remains gentle rather than intensifying—appropriate for the Accumulative lens but lacking the tightening that would elevate further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the paradox of outsourced feeling and the final wisdom: "To defeat emotional numbness, become the storm that remembers it is water." The brain as "the feeling you outsourced" reframes the custody battle into recognition of severed wholeness. Minor deduction for the scroll's explicit thematic statement, though it arrives after the emotional work is complete on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains surreal precision with inventive compounds ("timeline cartographer," "chronal heat") and philosophical density. However, register occasionally drifts into academic abstraction ("complementary opposites," "mutual recognition") that distances from embodied experience. The perceptual signature lacks character-specific filtering—both Kaels perceive identically despite their divergent paths. Dialogue from the brain and sensei reads more as conceptual pronouncement than natural speech.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of striking imagery but suffers from conceptual redundancy and abstract phrasing. "Custody dissolved into stewardship; ownership became guardianship" paraphrases the same shift. Template cadence appears in the ending sequence: "They stayed...When the scroll...Kael and Kael-2 smiled." Information density varies wildly—some sentences pack multiple layers while others merely restate. The philosophical register occasionally obscures concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of clone ethics, consciousness philosophy, and timeline chaos creates genuine originality. "Practice blade honed to cut arguments rather than flesh" and the brain speaking as severed emotion show inventive specificity. The corporate shaman backstory and some philosophical framing feel template-derived, but the execution transforms familiar elements through the unique emotional arithmetic of shared numbness becoming shared sensation.</comment>
