I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the strict rubric for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's grief-driven motivation is viscerally embodied through the shrapnel/geode parallel and her repurposing of the observatory's instruments. Her transformation from survivor to "perturbation" shows earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("bleak exhilaration" appears as label rather than embodied state) that doesn't quite reach the 8.8+ threshold of fully dramatized contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where she becomes "a perturbation, propagating outward." The geode's frequency broadcast and the final "I do" create legitimate cost and transformation. The piece teaches its lyric-scientific hybrid pattern early and maintains it. Slight deduction because the middle section's perturbation theory application could tighten the causal linkage between discovery and final action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating observatory functions as both setting and instrument of transformation, constraining her actions through cooling cycles and enabling her grief work through repurposed equipment. Vivid sensory work: "coolant mist drifted through the chamber like incense at a funeral that never finished." The geode's violet seams that "mapped every possible future" directly charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation operates through accumulative deepening as she moves from touching the geode to broadcasting its frequency, forcing drone algorithms to "falter." The timeframe pressure of cooling breakers creates urgency. Cost is visible in her acceptance of becoming a perturbation rather than returning to normal life, though the middle section could show more active resistance or struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the central question "where does unused potential pool after a life is severed mid-vow?" The answer—that it becomes "the medium through which she now moved"—reweights the entire piece without stating a moral. The wedding veil as targeting error and the parallel spacetime vision create resonant, non-literal answers to loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice merges scientific precision ("perturbation theory," "interferometer") with poetic compression ("widowed moon," "spectral banner"). The perceptual signature is consistent—she processes grief through physics and astronomy. Some register elevation in peak moments ("bleak exhilaration" used twice) prevents the 8.8+ band, but overall control is strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "She was no longer a survivor; she was a perturbation." However, "intangibly tangible" appears three times without evolving meaning, and "bleak exhilaration" repeats as a label. Some abstract constructions ("unused potential," "negative space of her own aborted timeline") could be more concretely embodied. These repetitions prevent higher scoring despite strong syntactic variety.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fusion of drone strike trauma with astrophysics creates a genuinely fresh angle on grief narratives. The specific detail of wedding veil mistaken for targeting error is haunting and original. The concept of hunting unused potential through perturbation theory offers unique emotional-scientific synthesis, though it doesn't quite reach the 8.5+ band of complete irreplaceability.</comment>
