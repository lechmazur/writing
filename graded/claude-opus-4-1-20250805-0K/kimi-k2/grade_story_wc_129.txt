<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to escape artistic isolation drives concrete choices throughout, from traveling to the crater to initiating the collaborative sculpture. The "luminescent ache" is effectively embodied through specific actions rather than labels. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("boldly sympathetic") but the closure choice to carve her signature shows earned vulnerability with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through collaborative additions to the arbor, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where isolation transforms into kinship. Cost is visible in tears and the years-later echo. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3. Deduction for slight causality softness in how others arrive at precisely the right moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard's singing trees and obsidian causeway create specific constraints (voices must be low to avoid shattering). Setting actively shapes the final collaborative sculpture through material properties (reeds bending without breaking, glass fusing). The crater functions as both physical and metaphorical container for transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of artistic isolation versus community connection established early and deepens through shared search and collaborative creation. The tightening occurs when multiple artists converge to transform Arbor's static tag into living art. Cost is legible in Lira's tears and the vulnerability of her tiny signature, though escalation could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of art as communal rather than solitary emerges through concrete actions—the empty stools, shared memories of murals, collaborative sculpture-building. The final image of future travelers feeling "expected" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral. Slight deduction for "webs of kinship" being too explicit in narration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent distance with selective perception (fingers smelling of peat, obsidian flecked with mica stars). Voice modulates appropriately from contemplative opening to collaborative middle to resonant ending. Dialogue between Lira and Fen carries subtext about longing for recognition. Minor repetition in "luminescent ache" phrase.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline specificity ("frost caught mid-breath," "translucent heart beating with refracted light"). Information density generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for scaffold phrases ("She understood then," "Years later") and slight overwriting in metaphorical density during non-peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of a street artist whose tags bind strangers into kinship offers fresh angle on community formation. Specific synthesis of glass-blowing and reed-weaving creates non-obvious collaboration. The transformation from seeking another's art to becoming the art themselves feels earned and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
