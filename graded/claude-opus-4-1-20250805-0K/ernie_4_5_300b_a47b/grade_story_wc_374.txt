<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and grounded in his skeptical curiosity about why people carry weather. His internal contradiction between disbelief and the compass's undeniable behavior creates genuine tension. The final renunciation of his skepticism carries visible cost as he confronts "terrestrially cosmic" truths he'd dismissed, though Lira's characterization remains functional rather than complex.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through sensory details (lavender to salt to copper taste) building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kael accepts the unexplainable. The closure lands with felt cost—"lavender and regret"—as his worldview shifts. The forests' election concept and compass evolution provide coherent pressure that crystallizes in the final recognition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lavender bluff under aurora creates immediate atmosphere while the compass ring functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—Kael must physically kneel and taste to understand. Environmental details (trembling petals, fractured aurora, bowing lavender) mirror internal states and the setting's agency (forests voting) directly shapes the climactic revelation. The sensory hierarchy privileges taste as Kael's investigative method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why people carry weather—escalates through sensory intensification from lavender to copper/blood taste, forcing Kael's physical retreat. The forests' election provides external pressure that converges with his investigation. Cost is visible when the compass slips from his thumb and his worldview forcibly shifts, though the resolution relies somewhat on Lira's exposition rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete image of the compass pointing to "moments" when the world shifts, not just people. The forests' elections embody the theme of balance between absorbing and releasing pain. The final taste of "lavender and regret" offers a non-literal answer about accepting mystery without moralizing, though some thematic weight depends on Lira's dialogue rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael's perceptual signature—tasting atmospheric changes—is distinctive and consistent throughout. The prose modulates from lyrical description to urgent physical reaction during the copper taste crisis. Lira's dialogue carries subtext about belonging to these mysterious places, though her voice could be more distinct. The narrative maintains POV discipline without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong opening with "lavender bluff shimmered" and resonant closing with "the world held its breath." Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some metaphorical density in peak beats ("liquid light," "thousand moths") and occasional elevated diction ("terrestrially cosmic") slightly above POV register, but prose remains clear and propulsive overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of forests holding elections and people carrying weather offers fresh fantasy worldbuilding. The compass as emergent tool evolving beyond its purpose is inventive. The synthesis of natural phenomena with democratic choice (trees voting) creates an original premise, though execution occasionally relies on exposition rather than pure discovery.</comment>
