<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to harmonize village energy through the corpse flower is clear and consistent, with embodied sensory details (olfactory sensitivity guiding cultivation choices). The transformation from rushing ambition to patient wisdom feels earned through the grandmother's dream intervention and subsequent behavioral change, though the village elders lack depth as pressure sources.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the corpse flower's growth paralleling Lira's understanding of patience. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the bloom harmonizes the village and validates her approach, with visible communal transformation as cost paid. However, the resolution feels somewhat predetermined—the flower blooms exactly as hoped without meaningful complication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The treetop village setting with its wooden walkways, mist-shrouded valley, and lantern-lit boughs creates vivid atmosphere that frames the story's contemplative tone. Olfactory details (musk of root, tang of leaf, corpse flower's scent evolution) effectively ground the herbalist's work, though the setting doesn't significantly constrain choices beyond providing garden space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving the corpse flower can bring harmony despite elder skepticism—is signaled early but lacks genuine escalation. The seed's dormancy creates mild pressure, resolved through Lira's shift to patience rather than external complication. The elders' opposition never manifests as active obstruction, making the conflict feel static.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of patience versus ambition emerges organically through Lira's cultivation journey, with the grandmother's whispered wisdom ("grows in the hush, not the roar") crystallizing the insight. The corpse flower as metaphor for transformation through patience works, though the final paragraph's explicit statement about "chaos and serenity...are kin" edges toward moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate psychic distance and sensory-filtered perception fitting an herbalist. However, prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("At the turning of the tide's thought") that feels artificially literary rather than organic to Lira's perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose suffers from overwriting with dense figurative language ("vines draped like ancient tapestries," "wildflower hush...hummed in her bones") that slows momentum. Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("her ambition was rooted in patience"), and the "journalized" neologism feels forced. Information density is uneven—some paragraphs could be cut without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>While the corpse flower as century-blooming catalyst offers potential, the execution follows predictable beats: skeptical elders, patient cultivation, validating bloom. The specific detail of olfactory-guided gardening provides freshness, but the arc lacks surprise or genuine risk—the flower blooms exactly as intended without meaningful transformation of the premise.</comment>
