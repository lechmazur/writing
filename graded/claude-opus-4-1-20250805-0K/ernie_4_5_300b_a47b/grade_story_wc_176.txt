<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to preserve forgotten names is clear and rooted in personal loss (his mother Lira), with embodied details like trembling scarred hands. The final choice to illuminate memory through light rather than fire shows earned transformation. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat compressed, and internal conflict could be more contradictory in scene rather than summarized ("after forgiving himself").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the rope's illumination and Lira's materialization—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (raw hands, lost voice). Causality holds as Kael's discovery of the punched card leads to the rope ritual. The cost is legible but could be more viscerally felt; the ending image of burning names provides closure but feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum constrains choices through its ceremonial rope mechanism and frozen isolation. Sensory details like "air tasted of snowmelt and iron" and the aurora's shifting shadows create atmosphere while the rope's braids become tactile tools for the ritual. The setting directly enables the story's central action and charges the final image with the mosaic of forgotten names.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving his mother's forgotten voice—is clear early and tightens as Kael works the rope mechanism despite trembling hands. The ritual's physical demands (aching back, raw hands) provide concrete cost. However, escalation feels somewhat mechanical through the rope's stages rather than driven by deepening internal pressure or meaningful reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of memory preservation emerges through concrete particulars—the punched card lullaby, erased census records, names etched in stone. The final image of burning names that "refused to die" resonates without moralizing. The story avoids abstraction through specific details like "crimson for blood, silver for moonlight," though the connection between fire/loss and light/preservation could be more subtly woven.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinct lyric register with controlled imagery ("green-gold veils," "rope coiled like a serpent"). POV remains stable with Kael's perceptual signature of technical gentleness despite scarred hands. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("void between stars"), but rhythm generally supports the meditative pace and mythic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lines often do multiple jobs, as in "The vendor had shrugged, 'Trash from the old quarter. Worthless.'" which establishes setting, conflict, and irony. Some overwriting appears ("glowed faintly, as if remembering sunlight") and occasional template phrasing ("Kael sat back, his hands raw but steady"). The prose maintains momentum but includes some figurative excess that doesn't always serve pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lost wax caster working with frozen light rather than molten metal offers a fresh angle on memory preservation. The punched card as memory storage device and the rope-weaving ritual feel specific. However, the setup relies on somewhat familiar tropes (dead mother, forgotten names, mystical sanctum) without fully transforming them through lived detail.</comment>
