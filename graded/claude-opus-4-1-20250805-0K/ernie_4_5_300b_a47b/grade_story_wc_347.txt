<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in the curse's compulsion, with embodied tension in "teeth on edge" and "bones into new shapes." The internal conflict between hatred of the birds and duty to travelers creates genuine pressure. However, the traveler remains underdeveloped as mere plot function, and Kael's emotional arc doesn't deepen beyond initial reluctance to satisfied duty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain: curse compels action → traveler cries → Kael uses blueprint → guides to safety → curse satisfied. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost ("frost began to bloom," "labyrinth would reset"). The orientation anchors early ("cliffside labyrinth," "Kael, the reluctant caretaker"). Missing deeper transformation limits higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The labyrinth's physical details constrain choices excellently—"frost-tipped gravel," "narrow gap," "crumbling fountain" all shape Kael's navigation. The mechanical birds create genuine spatial pressure with "shadows slicing through twilight." The nut's ridges "biting into his palm" makes the object tactile and consequential to the final unlocking mechanism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from traveler's cry to birds circling to frost forming, with clear time pressure. The "leave impressions without touching" constraint genuinely narrows options. However, the resolution feels predetermined—Kael succeeds without meaningful reversal or cost beyond what the curse already demands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of reluctant duty emerges through action, with the "graceless beauty" of imperfect markers resonating. The curse as both burden and purpose avoids simple moralizing. However, thematic depth remains limited—the story doesn't interrogate why Kael continues or what the labyrinth represents beyond literal maze.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in how Kael notices decay ("bruised sky," "veins beneath") and interprets the birds' mechanical nature. Voice modulates effectively under pressure with shorter, more urgent sentences during the rescue. The single line of dialogue "Go" carries appropriate urgency, though limited dialogue prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments like "labyrinth was a tangle of dead vines and fractured stone, its paths twisting like veins." Some repetitive phrasing appears ("Kael knelt" twice, multiple "Kael [verb]" constructions). Information density is generally good with lines doing multiple jobs, though some scaffolding remains in transitions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The mechanical birds as prison guards and the curse-compelled caretaker offer fresh angles on the guide-through-maze trope. The "impressions without touching" constraint creates original problem-solving. However, the rescue-traveler arc follows predictable beats without surprising transformation or complication.</comment>
