<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's guilt manifests through embodied details (trembling watch, barnacles of conscience) and drives his choice to reveal truth rather than manufacture another lie. The brother's erasure creates genuine moral complexity, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("guilt twisted, sharp and familiar"). The final decision to break the "sieved hush" carries visible cost—potential loss of client trust—earned through his journey with the driftwood memories.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through driftwood discoveries that reweight Elias's understanding, culminating in his decision to reveal the erased brother (Decisive Change with cost). The pattern of silence/erasure accumulates—from chipped teacup to carved "Silence" to the brother's deletion—creating resonant pressure. Minor orientation delay (Lila's physical presence unclear) doesn't harm closure. The cost lands clearly: "wondered if Lila would forgive him...betrayal."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The driftwood carvings function as micro-setting that constrains Elias's method and charges the final revelation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"air tasted of salt and secrets," weathered cedar, cold watch hand. The beach setting enables the discovery mechanism while the cobalt terrace frames before/after. Setting actively shapes choice through the ocean's preservation of "what people tried to bury."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: from questioning Lila's request to discovering family erasure to choosing truth over comfortable lies. The driftwood revelations tighten pressure—each carving narrows Elias's options toward inevitable disclosure. Cost is legible but could be sharper; we see potential consequences (Lila's reaction) rather than immediate price. The "sieved hush" must be broken despite professional risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ocean's preservation of buried truths versus manufactured memories—concrete objects (driftwood) embody abstract concepts without stating morals. The "sieved hush" as "space left behind when truth was swallowed by the tide" resonates through action. Final image of potential drowning "in the sound" offers non-literal answer to whether some silences should break. Minor deduction for "some truths were too heavy to carry alone" edging toward statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elias's profession-filtered observations ("manufacturing false memories," reading carved histories). Prose modulates with discovery—short, sharp sentences during visions. Some filter-verb clustering ("He saw," "He knew," "He understood") dulls immediacy in middle section. Voice maintains consistency through metaphorical register (barnacles, tide, drowning) that suits the coastal setting and moral weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Information density generally strong—most sentences advance discovery or deepen stakes. Template cadence appears mid-story ("He picked up...He saw...He understood...He continued") creating mechanical rhythm. Some paraphrase loops around silence/erasure concepts. Strong opening and closing lines, though "deep down" and "sharp and familiar" are stock phrases. The filter-verb stack in the vision sequences reduces immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of genealogy-as-erasure with driftwood-as-memory creates non-obvious angle on family secrets. The method of reading carved histories through psychometric touch adds originality. Specific details (cobalt terrace, trembling watch hand, carved "Silence") avoid generic treatment. The moral complexity of professional memory-falsification versus truth-telling resists easy resolution, though the concept of buried secrets washing ashore is somewhat familiar.</comment>
