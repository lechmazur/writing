<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's vigilance evolves from professional duty to personal reckoning as the liqueur label triggers memory work, with her final choice to become a story guardian showing earned transformation. The mysterious woman (Elias's daughter) applies immediate pressure that forces Mara's stance crystallization. Minor deduction for the woman's somewhat convenient appearance and exposition-heavy dialogue ("He thought... if he could spin stories into shared meaning").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with photographs accumulating meaning toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara shifts from solitary guardian to shared memory-keeper. The closure lands with visible cost as she places her own photo among the dead's artifacts, accepting her role. Slight opacity around Elias's actual fate (ghost/metaphor ambiguity) creates minor causality friction without breaking the closure effect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The receding reservoir exposing the drowned town's foundations creates tangible pressure for memory work, with the churchyard and tombstones providing spatial choreography for the photograph ritual. The midnight ridgeway and "mirrored hush" atmosphere effectively tension the discovery sequence. Setting constrains choice when Mara must work at the exposed ruins before waters potentially return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from dam inspection to confronting suppressed history through the liqueur label discovery, photograph placement ritual, and the woman's appearance forcing Mara to choose her role. The dominant stake—preserving memory versus letting the past drown—tightens when the woman reveals the dam's failing state creates urgency. Cost becomes visible when Mara places her own photo, accepting guardianship's burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory as active preservation emerges through concrete details: the sapphire liqueur as both toast and poison, photographs as "method for expunging ghosts," and the final image of two women walking the ridgeway with photos "lighting the way." The story resists simple preservation-versus-forgetting binaries by showing memory work as precisely humane vigilance. Elias's choice to document rather than flee adds moral complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in Mara's warden-trained observation ("scanned the water's surface for cracks") modulating to memory-haunted recognition. The woman's dialogue carries some exposition weight but "You've always been vigilant. Now you need to be something else" lands with subtext. Minor voice convergence when both women speak in similar registers despite different backgrounds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid selective detail ("foundations like broken teeth," "sapphire-hued liqueur label, half-buried in moss") creates atmosphere without overwriting. Some template phrasing in transitions ("She knelt," "She reached," "Mara turned") and mild paraphrase loop with "spin stories into shared meaning" appearing twice. The final image of photographs "lighting the way" risks slight metaphor strain but maintains momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The reservoir town's literal resurfacing paired with memory's metaphorical resurfacing offers a fresh angle on haunted-place narratives. Elias choosing to become a ghost through poisoned liqueur rather than flee transforms expected drowning-victim tropes. The photographs as both expunging and preserving method creates original tension, though the mysterious-woman-with-answers pattern feels familiar.</comment>
