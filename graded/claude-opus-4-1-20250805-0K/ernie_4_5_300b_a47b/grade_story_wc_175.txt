<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation to honor overlooked deaths is clear and consistent, but her internal experience relies heavily on abstract philosophical statements ("esoteric realist," "transiently rooted existence") rather than embodied emotion. The final choice to continue her work shows credible endurance but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—she never wavers or considers alternatives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lirael finds peace through her ritual. The cost—emotional labor and physical ache from the meticulous work—is present but mild. The piece teaches its pattern of ephemeral memorial-making and pays it off when the monarch validates her gesture, though the transformation lacks decisive stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The grotto setting is vivid and atmospheric ("mist curled like spun sugar"), anchoring who/where/when immediately. The moss, spider silk, and fading light create tactile presence that supports the meditative tone. However, the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain choices—Lirael could perform this ritual anywhere with similar materials.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring the moth's death before the monarch passes—creates gentle pressure but never truly escalates. The monarch's arrival and departure constitute the only turn, and Lirael faces no opposition or complication to her goal. The "interrupted cadence" of her breathing mirrors her work but doesn't deepen conflict or force harder choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of honoring overlooked lives emerges organically through Lirael's actions with the moth wing and silk lattice. The monarch-moth juxtaposition (endurance vs. fragility) creates resonance without explicit moralizing. The final image of continuing this ephemeral work despite its impermanence offers a non-literal answer about finding meaning in temporary gestures.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with appropriate psychic distance. However, the prose frequently drifts into abstract philosophical register ("transiently rooted existence," "ephemeral monuments to the unseen") that feels more authorial than character-driven. No dialogue to evaluate, and the perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness beyond general poetic observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Significant overwriting issues: elevated diction clashes with intimate moments ("verdant grotto," "iridescent," "hymn"), creating register drift throughout. Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the moth's death ("died mid-flight"/"life ending not with a bang but a whisper"/"How often did such deaths occur"). The prose prioritizes poetic effect over momentum, with density of figurative language in most sentences without pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The concept of building ephemeral memorials from natural materials offers a fresh angle on grief and remembrance. However, the execution relies on familiar literary gestures (butterfly as transformation symbol, spider silk as fragility metaphor) without sufficient transformation. The piece commits to its meditative premise but doesn't risk bold structural or perspectival choices.</comment>
