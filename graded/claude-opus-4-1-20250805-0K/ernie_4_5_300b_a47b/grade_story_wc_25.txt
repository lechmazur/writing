<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to prove "whispers travel farther than shouts" drives consistent choices through the labyrinth, with embodied stress (trembling hands, breath hitching). The final choice to hum rather than answer shows earned character consistency. However, internal conflict remains mostly stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses, and the epiphany about the labyrinth's listening nature arrives without sufficient struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the labyrinth as sentient observer, building through map discoveries to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias understands the maze's consciousness. The closure lands with him choosing whispers over shouts, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt—we see changed tactics but not what Elias sacrifices. The chamber discovery provides the key turn, yet the ease of finding the staircase undercuts earned struggle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting actively constrains choices—containers shift, walls vibrate, paths reshape based on walker patterns. Sensory details (ozone taste, metal vibrations, static hum) create atmospheric pressure during the storm. The maze functions as both physical obstacle and conscious entity that "identifies people's walks," making environment essential to the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers beat shouts—manifests through Elias's navigation choices and culminates in his final refusal to shout directions. The geomagnetic storm provides escalating pressure (lights flickering, containers shifting), and Voss's challenge creates a ticking clock. However, the discovery of the chamber feels coincidental rather than earned through protagonist agency, and the "double pay" prize undercuts the personal stakes Elias claims.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of quiet observation versus loud assertion emerges through concrete choices—Elias tracking shouting haulers, finding the hidden chamber through careful attention to symbols. The zodiac coin and maps create a pattern of hidden knowledge rewarding patience. The ending's "The labyrinth didn't need maps. It needed whispers" crystallizes the theme, though it edges toward explicit statement rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency through technical vocabulary (quadrants, containers, valves) appropriate to Elias's profession, with perceptual focus on sounds and vibrations fitting his theory. Dialogue remains minimal but functional ("Which way?" / "Not long enough"). However, some passages drift into elevated register ("talisman," "creak and echo") that doesn't fully align with a maintenance worker's internal lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose generally maintains clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful short sentences during tension ("A click. The container's door swung open"). However, several template constructions appear ("Elias picked it up," "Elias smiled," "Elias descended") and the phrase "whispers travel farther than shouts" repeats without variation. The metaphor "map...felt less like a guide and more like a prayer" works but similar constructions accumulate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sentient labyrinth that reshapes based on walker patterns offers a fresh angle on maze navigation, transforming the challenge from spatial to behavioral. The integration of zodiac symbolism with industrial setting creates unexpected synthesis. The concept that quiet observation beats loud assertion in navigation subverts typical action-adventure approaches, though the execution remains somewhat safe in avoiding deeper ambiguity.</comment>
