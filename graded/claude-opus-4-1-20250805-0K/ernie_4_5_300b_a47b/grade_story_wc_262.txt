I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered discoveries and psychometric revelations, with density increase and pattern accumulation reweighting the dominant stake of finding "unused love."

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her grandmother's letters, with concrete embodied perception through psychometry. The internal conflict between seeking and fearing what she'll find plays out through specific actions. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("spatial imagination" feels explained rather than shown) and the resolution feeling slightly neat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara commits to uncovering the Alhambra's secrets, with visible emotional cost ("tears pricking her eyes"). The accumulative structure coheres well through psychometric revelations that deepen understanding. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established clearly by ~120 words. Minor deduction for the cost being more felt than dramatically paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The projection booth setting actively constrains and enables Mara's psychometric reading, with vivid sensory detail ("dust and decayed film stock," "scarred wooden table"). The physical environment guides her discovery process. The Alhambra functions as more than backdrop—it's a container for memory that shapes the investigation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding where unused love is stored) deepens through psychometric revelations that narrow Mara's understanding from abstract to specific. The tightening occurs when she discovers the letters were never sent and love remained "unused." Cost is legible in the emotional weight but lacks a harder trade-off or foreclosed option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of unused/unspoken love emerges organically through the discovered film and letters, avoiding direct moralizing. The final image of Mara as keeper of secrets resonates without stating a thesis. The recurring motif of containers (film canisters, letters, the booth itself) effectively charges the closure without feeling forced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled psychic distance and clean free indirect style during visions. Some register elevation during emotional peaks ("the theater of light where love went to die") that slightly strains the established voice. Perceptual signature clear in how Mara experiences the world as "a lattice of memories."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum. Several instances of elevated diction that feel writerly ("incubate an idea," "lattice of memories," "hushed thunder") and some filter verb clustering ("she sensed," "she could feel"). Information density is moderate but could be tighter in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The psychometry concept offers a fresh angle on discovering hidden love stories, though the execution sometimes feels familiar (hidden letters, wartime separation). The specific synthesis of crystal gazing with film projection booth creates some originality. The transformation of "unused love" from metaphor to literal discovery shows ingenuity.</comment>
