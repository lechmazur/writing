<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias's earnest naivety drives consistent choices through the bell repair, though internal contradiction remains mostly told ("brittle devotion") rather than embodied in conflicting impulses. The final choice to persist despite imperfection lands with some cost ("brittle with exhaustion but warm with hope"), but the emotional progression feels somewhat tidy without genuine irrationality or self-deception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the dripping rhythm building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the bell's imperfect function creates "balanced" stability. Cost is visible in Elias's exhaustion and the acknowledgment that "the bell would need constant adjustment, the rift might reopen," though the cosmic stakes feel abstract compared to the physical work. The orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words with character, setting, and situation established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct functions as both setting and constraint, with its glass surface and architectural design channeling the ocean's pulse in ways that directly affect Elias's solution. The bell's physical properties (weight, cracks, dripping rates) constrain choices throughout, particularly in the calibration sequence where "the metal needed to stretch before it could hold." Sensory detail effectively narrows during the work sequence to focus on the drip rhythm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake of healing the cosmic rift through bell repair escalates through the physical challenge of calibration, with one meaningful tightening when "the bell's cracks widened slightly" threatens failure. Agency manifests through Elias's persistent adjustments despite Marla's skepticism, though the resolution feels somewhat convenient with the synchronization succeeding just as "the last fish was caught."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between perfection and functionality, with Elias's "Madness is just devotion without a roadmap" offering resonance without moralizing. The bell-as-heartbeat metaphor connects to the viaduct's pulse coherently, though the cosmic imbalance remains abstract. The final image of "fragile, flawed, earnestly naive kind of faith" reweights the opening's broken relic, though conceptual cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent earnestness through Elias's perceptual signature of seeing puzzles where others see futility, with dialogue carrying naturalistic skepticism from Marla ("You're mad"). Some register elevation occurs in descriptive passages ("bridge of frozen light") that slightly exceeds Elias's likely lexicon, though the rhythmic control during the calibration sequence effectively mirrors the dripping tempo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with selective metaphors like "bridge of frozen light" and "metronome for the viaduct's pulse," though some passages edge toward overwriting ("the rift—a jagged tear in the sky—seemed to stitch itself shut"). Minor template cadence appears in "He'd spent nights... He'd been told... He'd calculated" but doesn't pervade. Information density is generally strong with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of fixing cosmic imbalance through mechanical calibration offers a fresh angle, though the execution relies on somewhat familiar magical-realism tropes. The specific synthesis of dripping rates, tidal synchronization, and the viaduct's architectural function creates moderate originality. The story commits to its premise but doesn't risk bold structural or perspectival choices that might elevate beyond competent execution.</comment>
