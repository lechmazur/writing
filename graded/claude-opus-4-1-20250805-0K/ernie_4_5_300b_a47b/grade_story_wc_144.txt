I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through sensory details (mist, light through water, tactile repair work) toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lira's method of "seeing" through water/light validates her unique perception.

<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lira's blindness paired with her unique perception method creates genuine character specificity, and her internal confidence despite Marlow's validation shows earned self-knowledge. The "listening as seeing" metaphor lands with thematic weight. Minor deduction for some explanatory interiority ("she'd learned to 'see' by touch") that tells rather than embodies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lira's successful repair validating her water-light method, with the ship's departure crystallizing her role. Cost is present but somewhat oblique - the "invisible mending" carries conceptual weight but lacks visceral stakes. The accumulative lens holds but the closure could use sharper definition of what's at risk beyond professional competence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The water basin as micro-setting brilliantly constrains and enables Lira's repair method, becoming essential to the story's logic. The depot's industrial atmosphere (mist, tracks, anchor lift) creates coherent pressure. Sensory details effectively filtered through Lira's non-visual perception, though some descriptions feel externally observed rather than POV-bound.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on the drone repair's success for the maiden voyage, with modest escalation through the servo discovery. The ticking clock of dawn departure provides time pressure but doesn't significantly tighten options. The resolution feels professionally competent rather than dramatically costly - missing the deeper personal stakes that would elevate conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "seeing what's broken" theme elegantly emerges through Lira's blindness and unique perception method, avoiding explicit moralizing. The water-as-truth metaphor and "listening as seeing" create layered meaning. The lullaby about stars guiding ships home resonates with the navigation theme without forcing connections.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clean third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and controlled diction appropriate to the technical setting. Dialogue between Lira and Marlow feels natural with proper subtext. Some filter phrases ("she could feel") slightly dull immediacy, and occasional register elevation ("liquid sunlight") doesn't fully match the workshop pragmatism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum through the repair sequence. Several instances of explanatory scaffolding ("She'd initially scoffed, but now she relied on the method") and some purple touches ("mist clung...like a second skin"). The "somewhere, a ship sailed on" construction in the final paragraph feels artificially elevated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The blind artisan using water/light refraction to diagnose problems offers genuine freshness, transforming the expected disability narrative. The hummingbird drones as hull inspectors show inventive world-building. Loses points for somewhat conventional mentor-student dynamic and the predictable success arc without meaningful complication.</comment>
