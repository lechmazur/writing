I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the strict rubric for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery (disappearing ink patterns, wind-carved encampment, eclipse light) toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lira steps through the tower door.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is concrete and embodied through her brother's erasure during the last eclipse, driving consistent choices. The "serene anger" manifests believably through controlled actions rather than labels. Minor deduction for the child character appearing late without sufficient pressure on the central conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as Lira crosses the threshold into the Tower of Hours, crystallizing her quest with visible stakes. The accumulative lens holds through wind-sculpted patterns, ephemeral ink designs, and time fragments. Deduction for slight causality softness in how the ink patterns directly reveal the tower location - the mechanism feels convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment and disappearing ink patterns constrain choices effectively - Lira must read ephemeral shapes before they vanish. The Tower of Hours as "a place where time pools like water" charges the final image. Strong sensory hierarchy filtered through tracker expertise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from following the drone to discovering the tower's reality to confronting what "stole" her brother. The child's revelation that "time gets stuck" meaningfully deepens understanding. Cost is visible in Lira's decision to defy the elders' warnings, though the final confrontation remains ahead.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of permanence and ephemerality - disappearing ink revealing truth, time fragmenting into readable moments. The child's "like breath - here, then gone" crystallizes the thematic question. The tower as mirror metaphor resonates without overstatement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent POV with selective perception fitting a tracker ("bleached bone," "earth-toned tents"). Dialogue between Lira and the child feels natural with appropriate subtext. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in "consciously wild intuition" that doesn't fully match established diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deduction for occasional overwriting ("fractal spirals," "resonant reconfiguration of meaning") and one instance of filter stacking in the middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of time anomaly, disappearing ink cipher, and tracker protagonist creates a fresh angle on the quest narrative. The Tower of Hours as a place where "time pools like water" offers conceptual originality. The specific detail of reading truth in wind-sculpted ink patterns before they vanish is inventive.</comment>
