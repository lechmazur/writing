<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to forge "the sound of trust breaking" drives clear, embodied choices throughout, with her synesthetic perception creating distinctive interiority. The final moment where she can "hear the silence between heartbeats, the absence where love should be" shows earned transformation with visible cost—her father's betrayal crystallized into sensory reality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through collected absences toward Lira creating the hearing aid that captures betrayal's frequency. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she experiences the amplified absence "where love should be," with cost visible in her being "battered but marveling." The forge-to-forging progression and memory-harvesting create clear causality, though the father's disappearance backstory slightly exceeds the 20% reflection allowance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks creates vivid constraint—Lira must harvest memories from specific wrecks, dig through frozen soil, work with a cold forge. Sensory detail filters through her synesthetic POV ("lavender static, the green hum of moss"), and the aurora's light shifting from "liquid mercury" to "streaks of violet and jade" tracks with emotional progression.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: collecting absence-memories, adding the peach tree root causing the mixture to erupt, then forging the device that amplifies betrayal's frequency. The cost manifests in Lira clutching her ears from "exhilarating" pain and the final realization of absence "where love should be," though agency could be stronger in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of absence-as-presence emerges organically through Lira's synesthetic gift, the dead orchard, and her forge-work with collected voids. The final image—hearing "the silence between heartbeats, the absence where love should be"—offers a resonant non-literal answer about how betrayal manifests as negative space rather than active presence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lira's synesthetic perception creates a distinct voice ("heard colors faintly as vibrations in her cochlea"), with controlled psychic distance and consistent focalization. The prose modulates effectively from technical precision ("liquid memory—clear, viscous substances labeled with dates") to visceral sensation ("a scream of glass shattering"), though some filter constructions could be tightened.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "ghostly static of rusted hulls pressing against glass panes" and effective variation in sentence structure. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("She'd harvested them from the shipwrecks" followed by itemized list; "memories fracture" echoed in later passages) and some elevated diction ("ephemeral resonance") occasionally drifts from Lira's established register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synesthetic hearing aid designer who perceives absence as sound offers a fresh synthesis, particularly in forging betrayal's frequency from collected voids. The conceit of trees storing memories in roots and the specific image of "listening to the trees' memories" transforms familiar loss-and-memory territory through concrete sensory innovation.</comment>
