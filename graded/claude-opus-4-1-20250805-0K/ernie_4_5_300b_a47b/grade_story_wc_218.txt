<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to heal the temple through symbiotic architecture is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied actions (tracing runes, winding copper). Her acceptance of mortality drives meaningful choices with visible cost. However, the spirit character lacks depth beyond symbolic presence, and some emotional beats rely on declaration ("brazen calm") rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Lira's death becomes the orchard's eternal heartbeat, with visible cost in her final breath. The copper-wire network successfully bridges human and spirit realms. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the central conflict's stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The living stone pillars and copper-wrapped oak branches constrain choices and enable the resolution. Setting actively participates through the pillars' warmth and humming vibrations. The orchard functions as both obstacle and solution, though some descriptions lean toward the ornamental ("dappling the temple orchard in gold").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal project to interspecies harmony, with the spirit's resistance creating genuine tension ("The spirits were never violent, but their displeasure could shake foundations"). The copper-wire connection serves as the meaningful tightening point. Cost is visible in Lira's death, though middle escalation could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the bridge metaphor: "You build walls... We build boxes. But this? This is a bridge." The ending reweights the opening's architectural work as spiritual translation. The concept of pain as language adds complexity without moralizing, though "pain can be a language too" edges toward explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent POV with selective perception focused on botanical and architectural details. The spirit's dialogue ("Why?" "It hurts") contrasts effectively with Lira's measured tone. Some filter phrases ("Lira recalled," "She'd learned") slightly dull immediacy in non-critical moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Several paraphrase loops appear ("gentle and systematic" echoed without variation, repeated "brazen calm"). Template cadence in middle sections ("She unspooled... She wound... She recalled") creates mild drag, though the closing sequence regains momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The copper-wire-as-translation concept offers a fresh angle on human-nature harmony stories. The specific botanical approach to architectural healing feels original. However, the dying-caretaker-finds-meaning frame is familiar, and some elements (wise dying protagonist, nature spirits) follow established patterns without significant transformation.</comment>
