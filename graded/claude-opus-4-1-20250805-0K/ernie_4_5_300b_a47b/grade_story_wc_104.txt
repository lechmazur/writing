<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete details like chains biting wrists and patience as strategic waiting. The final choice to break free and throw the vial shows earned agency with visible cost. However, internal conflict could be more contradictory in-scene rather than sequential, and the scavengers lack specificity as pressure sources.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Decisive Change when Lirael breaks her chains and releases the seeds, with visible cost in her imprisonment and the world's broken state. The causal lens holds through puzzle-solving leading to vault access leading to seed release. The "wall coming down" trigger feels somewhat arbitrary and could be more causally integrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting effectively constrains choices through the hidden vault location and puzzle mechanics. Sensory details like "dust and forgotten cotton candy" and "cold floor" ground the POV. The seed vault's glass vials "shimmering like liquid starlight" provide specific imagery that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from patient waiting to active puzzle-solving to confrontation with scavengers, with Lirael's chains as persistent constraint. The seeds' instant growth provides visible resolution with cost. However, the scavengers arrive too conveniently and their threat could be more specifically dramatized rather than summarized as "faces twisted with greed."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of resilience planted in dry soil emerges through concrete action rather than statement, with the seeds as literal and metaphorical hope. The "chained liberator" paradox works conceptually. However, the ending's instant vine-growth and soil trembling feels too neat, and "resilience had been planted" edges toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency through selective perception focused on puzzle elements and tactile details. "Staggering grace" appears in Lirael's movement at the climax. Some phrases like "ghost's whisper" and "liquid starlight" feel elevated beyond the established register, and filter verbs ("knew she had moments") occasionally dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose shows variety in sentence structure and paragraph length, with strong verbs like "rattled," "clung," "wrenched." However, several template constructions appear ("She'd been... She'd spent... She reached...") and metaphors occasionally strain ("clung to corners like a ghost's whisper"). The phrase "resilience had been planted" abstracts rather than embodies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The puzzle-box structure with keys matching arrow fletching offers a fresh take on the seed vault concept. The carnival setting as cover for serious purpose shows originality. However, the instant-growth seeds and convenient scavenger timing feel templated, and the resolution relies on familiar tropes without sufficient transformation.</comment>
