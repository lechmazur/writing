I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered revelations about echoes as memories, with density increasing toward the closure where Kael's understanding transforms his purpose.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to understand why some echo while others fade drives consistent action through the ascent. The revelation about "unfinished stories" creates genuine internal shift, though the transformation feels slightly rushed in the final beats. Strong embodied details like the seashell pressed to his heart anchor emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Kael understands his purpose shifts from singing for beauty to preserving trapped stories - "for the first time, he felt the canyon sing back—not in echo, but in answer." The accumulative lens holds as revelations layer toward this crystallized understanding with felt cost in accepting this burden.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus functions as active participant - the canyon holds memories, stone splits "like a scar," and the summit's standing stones enable the final revelation. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through Kael's ascent, with environment constraining his path and enabling discovery through the fissure and summit circle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen progressively from personal curiosity to cosmic responsibility as Kael learns echoes are "memories trapped in stone." The hooded figure's revelation forces Kael to accept his role as keeper of lost stories, though the opposition could be more visceral. Cost becomes clear in his acceptance of this eternal burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the echo metaphor - some voices persist because their stories remain unfinished, too heavy to fade. The final image of Kael singing while "the universe hummed its secret song" resonates without stating a moral, suggesting art's role in preserving human experience against cosmic indifference.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm - "where stone coils like a sleeping serpent." The "reed-blown melancholy" permeates diction choices. Minor convergence occurs in the hooded figure's speech which echoes Kael's register too closely, though the mystical context partially justifies this.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty - "each note a thread in the webs of intrigue that tangled the valley." Some overwriting appears in dense metaphorical passages, and the phrase "memories, trapped in the stone" repeats verbatim. Information density remains high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of a canyon that holds echoes as unfinished stories offers fresh perspective on memory and loss. The seashell as cosmic tuning fork feels specific. However, the wise figure revelation follows familiar mentor-meets-seeker patterns without sufficient transformation of the trope.</comment>
