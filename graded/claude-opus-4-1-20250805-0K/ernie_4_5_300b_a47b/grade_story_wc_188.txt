<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's guilt over the pavilion fire creates genuine internal conflict that drives her quest for redemption through the fortress's mysteries. The final choice to embrace becoming fire shows earned transformation with visible cost, though some emotional transitions (the "raw and unfamiliar" laugh) feel slightly unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through fire-lily imagery that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira transforms from guilt-ridden to purposeful. The closure lands with felt cost ("becoming fire") though the conceptual price could be more concrete. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fortress setting actively constrains Lira's path through its labyrinthine structure and the fire-lilies become the mechanism for her transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("liquid light pooling on cobblestones"), though some descriptions lean ornamental rather than pressure-building.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal redemption to igniting dormant potential, with the kerosene knot's flame spreading to trigger the chain reaction. The cost is visible in Lira's transformation to "becoming fire," though the middle lacks a clear tightening moment under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of transforming guilt into purposeful action emerges through the fire imagery without explicit moralizing. The final realization that "shadows weren't darkness, but unlit potential" offers a resonant answer that reweights the opening failure, though the mentor's wisdom occasionally veers toward platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on fire and light, and the chanting creates a distinct rhythmic texture. Some phrases feel overwrought ("velvet void, starless") and the shift to present tense in the final paragraph, while intentional, slightly disrupts flow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, though figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("tapestry of color," "living embers," "velvet void" in quick succession). The repetition of "chants" works as pattern but some metaphors strain ("hopelessness is a gravity").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of fireworks designer seeking redemption through a light-blooming fortress offers a fresh angle on the redemption arc. The specific detail of fire-lilies as both setting and mechanism for transformation elevates beyond template, though some mentor wisdom feels familiar.</comment>
