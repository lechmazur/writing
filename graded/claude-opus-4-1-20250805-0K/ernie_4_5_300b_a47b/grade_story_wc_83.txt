I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This operates as a **Causal** lens - Elara's actions follow because/therefore linkage as she pursues the node, with each discovery narrowing her options toward accessing the unused potential.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's grief-driven motivation is embodied through concrete actions (tracing glass cracks, clutching the biting geode) and her transformation from survivor to "seer/disrupter" tracks causally. The characterization loses points for diagnostic label-speak ("unfiltered awakening," "perturbation theory") and some emotional summary ("a sound like shattered glass") rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from wedding destruction through observatory hunt to node access, with clear closure as Elara transforms into a "seer" at visible cost (lost observatory, isolation). The "unused potential is anger/grief" revelation lands with earned weight. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay and some expository dialogue with Orion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating observatory and crater setting effectively constrain choices (circuit breaker countdown, unstable node location), with vivid sensory detail ("reeked of ozone and ash"). The geode physically guides like a compass and the underground vein network provides strong spatial anchoring. Loses points for some generic descriptors ("swirling vortex of light and sound").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear escalation through circuit breaker countdown creating time pressure, Elara's choice to override safety protocols, and the node's expansion "devouring the crater." The cost is legible (observatory destroyed, complete isolation) though the final transformation's stakes could be sharper. One meaningful tightening through her decision to enter the unstable node despite warnings.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming trauma into power emerges organically through the hunt for "unused potential" and pays off with "anger/grief...refuses to die." The geode's evolution from wedding rubble to living crystal carries thematic weight. Some points lost for explicit thematic statements ("perturbation...the raw, unfiltered edge of survival") rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Distinct voice with strong rhythm control ("Elara laughed, a sound like shattered glass") and effective short declaratives under pressure. Dialogue between Elara and Orion maintains naturalistic tension. Deductions for occasional register drift into academic terminology that doesn't fully match Elara's emotional state and some filter-heavy passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("each fissure a timeline of the drone strike") but suffers from template cadence in places ("She saw...She laughed...She walked"). Some paraphrase loops ("unused potential pooled"/"where unused potential pooled"). The stacked "She [verb]" pattern in the final third particularly weakens momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery through literal energy harvesting, with the geode as both memorial and tool. The "perturbation theory" application to emotional trauma shows originality. Some derivative elements (AI guide, chosen one transformation) prevent higher scoring, though the specific execution elevates familiar components.</comment>
