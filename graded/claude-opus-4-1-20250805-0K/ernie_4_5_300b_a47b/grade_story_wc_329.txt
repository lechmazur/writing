<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions with the locust shell serving as both tool and talisman. Her internal conflict between preservation and destruction plays out through physical trembling and bleeding fingers, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed. The final realization about "letting go of the illusion of control" lands as earned wisdom from her struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Lira's music breaking the statues' control, with visible cost in her bleeding fingers and the orchard's transformation. The causal lens holds as each action (finding shell → learning its language → playing music → cracking statues) builds logically. The closure lands with "The orchard listened. This time, it answered" showing reciprocal change, though the cost could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard with its "peaches glowed like captured sunsets" and glass sky-bridge creates vivid, purposeful setting that constrains choices. The environment actively participates—metallic peaches fall like tears, grass sways to unscripted rhythm, liquid starlight erupts. The locust shell functions as micro-setting that enables the central action through its "hollow chambers" teaching rhythm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal mission to systemic transformation as Lira's music progressively affects the statues' cores. The dominant stake—reawakening beauty in mechanized order—tightens when she discovers the crack and must play "until her fingers bled." Cost is visible in physical pain and the risk of the statues' response, culminating in their destruction and the orchard's chaotic rebirth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between order and chaos, control and wildness, without explicit moralizing. The locust shell's transformation from hidden artifact to instrument of change embodies the theme organically. The final insight about "trusting the chaos to hold its own kind of order" reweights the entire conflict, offering a non-literal answer that avoids tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "resonantly soft" and "liquid starlight" that match the enchanted setting. POV remains stable in close third, with Lira's perceptions filtering the fantastical elements. Some moments edge toward purple prose ("bled gold through the trees") but rhythm generally supports the mystical atmosphere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of beauty—"peaches glowed like captured sunsets"—with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, some figurative density in peak beats ("cloud of iridescent dust that swirled into the air, settling on the statues like a curse") and occasional abstract phrasing ("gap between knowing and understanding") slightly impede momentum. The final image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of music as revolutionary force against mechanical order offers fresh angle on rebellion narrative. The locust shell as conduit between natural and imposed order is inventive. The story commits to its premise of beauty versus mechanization, though some elements (living statues, enchanted orchard) draw from familiar fantasy tropes.</comment>
