<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lila's motivation to reconnect after years of ghostwriting others' emotions is clear and consistent. Her internal contradiction between helping others express truth while hiding her own creates genuine tension. The final choice to write her secret and encourage truth-telling is earned, though the transformation feels somewhat swift for the story's scope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Lila's journey toward connection building through the spiral, Elara's guidance, and the art installation to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she releases her secret. The closure lands with emotional cost as she acknowledges her fear of disconnection. Orientation is clear by ~100 words. The transformation from isolation to openness tracks causally though the middle development could deepen.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lotus temple and lily pond create a vivid sacred space that enables reflection and transformation. Sensory details like "prismatic quiet" and "liquid light" enhance atmosphere. The setting constrains choice when the art installation requires public confession. However, some descriptions lean decorative rather than essential to pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Lila's fear of disconnection—is signaled early through her hollow feeling despite helping others connect. Pressure builds through the spiral's mystery, Elara's challenge, and the installation's demand for vulnerability. The final act of writing and releasing her secret demonstrates agency with emotional cost, though escalation could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of authentic connection versus hidden truths emerges organically through Lila's ghostwriting paradox and the temple's transformative spaces. The spiral as keeper of secrets and the sinking orbs create resonant images for transformation. The ending avoids explicit moralizing, though Elara's dialogue occasionally veers toward theme statements like "Secrets aren't meant to be locked away."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Lila's interiority with phrases like "her chest tightened" and "tears pricking her eyes." Elara's dialogue has a distinct whimsical register ("curator? Guide? It depends on the day"). Some passages drift toward elevated literary diction that doesn't fully match Lila's professional background.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between reflection and action. Strong images like "petal-strewn crown" and "liquid light" enhance atmosphere. Minor issues include occasional overwriting ("the soft rustle of lotus leaves" in already quiet space) and some template phrasing around emotional beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ghostwriter discovering authentic expression through public art offers a fresh angle on connection themes. The lotus temple setting and glass orb installation create specific, memorable imagery. The transformation from writing others' truths to revealing her own provides organic character development, though the concept doesn't fully transcend familiar therapeutic breakthrough narratives.</comment>
