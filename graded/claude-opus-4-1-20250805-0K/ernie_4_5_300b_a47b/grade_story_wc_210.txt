<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to revive the cove is clear and consistent, driving his methodical work through memory reconstruction. The internal arc from hollow vessel to tear-filled witness works, though the transformation lacks embodied struggle in middle beats. His "fierce" burning motivation is asserted rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the cove's revival via collective memory, with the amber bottle serving as a focusing lens. The cost—that this is reimagining rather than resurrection—lands clearly in "not from stone and mortar, but from memory and will." The accumulative lens holds as details build toward the transformation, though the middle section's cataloging of artifacts slightly weakens causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Paper-Lantern Cove is vividly rendered through salt-laden air, crumbling piers, and spectral echoes, with strong historical layering about phosphorus mines. The amber bottle's seamless surface and warming response to Elias's resolve creates tactile specificity. The setting transformation from ghost town to memory-revival directly shapes the closure, though middle passages lean toward catalog rather than lived-in detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reviving a dead civilization through memory—is clear from the opening. Escalation occurs through the accumulation of artifacts and the bottle's growing warmth, culminating in the cove's awakening. However, the middle lacks active opposition or meaningful tightening; Elias faces no real obstacles to his methodical work until the final transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of memory as resurrection emerges organically through the amber bottle's transformation from barrier to lens. The final image of "reimagining—a civilization rebuilt not from stone and mortar, but from memory and will" offers resonant answer without stating a moral. The piece avoids sentimentality while exploring how collective memory can revive what's lost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and no head-hopping. Distinctive touches like "lanterns...flickered like half-forgotten dreams" and "spectral echoes of a ghost town revival" create atmospheric texture. Some phrases edge toward purple ("salt-laden air," "gaunt face") but serve the melancholic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the transformation sequence. However, several instances of telling rather than showing ("His motivation burned fierce," "tears mixing with the salt spray") and some overwriting in descriptive passages ("hues of amber and violet"). The phrase "not a resurrection, but a reimagining" effectively crystallizes the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of memory-based alchemy offers a fresh angle on resurrection stories, with the amber bottle as focusing lens being genuinely inventive. The specific history of Paper-Lantern Cove grounds the fantastical premise. However, the alchemist-seeking-revival setup follows familiar patterns, and the middle section's artifact-gathering feels templated.</comment>
