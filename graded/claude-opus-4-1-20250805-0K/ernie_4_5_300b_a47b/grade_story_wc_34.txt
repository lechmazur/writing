<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to encode unspoken needs is consistent and deepens through specific recipients (Lira, brother, self), with embodied emotion in the trembling flower press and warm metal. The internal conflict between silence and the urge to speak crystallizes in his final self-directed message, though the resolution lacks a decisive cost beyond the symbolic bluebell pressing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through encoded messages, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias presses the bluebell—shifting from encoding for others to a tangible act. However, the cost remains primarily symbolic rather than viscerally felt, and the "maybe, just maybe" hedging weakens the closure's decisiveness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The misty courtyard setting actively shapes Elias's ritual, with stones that "hum" and mist "driftingly alert" creating atmosphere that constrains and enables his encoding. The flower press bolt plate functions as micro-setting, grounding his grandmother's legacy while steadying his hand, though the setting could more directly pressure his choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—articulating unspoken needs through ghost-mediated graffiti—progresses through three encoded messages with increasing personal weight. The storm's arrival creates temporal pressure, but the resolution ("maybe, just maybe") deflates rather than crystallizes the accumulated tension, lacking a definitive foreclosure of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of encoding silence into art, with the ghost as bridge between living and lost. The bluebell pressing reweights earlier encoding as Elias shifts from indirect communication to direct gesture, though the final "For you" remains deliberately ambiguous without full resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with inventive phrases like "tinkersong wonder" and "charcoal stick dipped in moonlight," creating a distinct perceptual signature. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately with emotional intensity, though occasional overwriting ("driftingly alert" used twice) slightly dulls precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves atmospheric density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptions that blend setting with emotion. However, "driftingly alert" repetition, some filter-verb clusters ("Elias believed," "he knew"), and the hedging final paragraph ("maybe, just maybe") create minor momentum drags without harming closure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ghost-as-code concept offers a fresh angle on grief communication, with specific details like moonlight-dipped charcoal and the grandmother's flower press creating originality. The synthesis of encoding messages into walls for spectral delivery feels organic, though the resolution's ambiguity plays somewhat safe.</comment>
