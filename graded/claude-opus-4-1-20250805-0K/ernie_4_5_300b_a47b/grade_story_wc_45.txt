<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's skepticism and "shrewdly innocent curiosity" create genuine internal contradiction that drives her choices, particularly in the fountain scene where she risks using the tooth despite uncertainty. The earned reconciliation with Elias shows believable emotional complexity. However, Elias's motivations remain underdeveloped—his years-long absence and sudden return lack sufficient grounding to fully justify the closure moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's realization that "the garden's not a trick... It's a mirror," with visible cost in both characters' acknowledgment of avoidance. The causal chain from tooth-as-key to bone-setting metaphor to reconciliation holds coherently. The cost appears in their mutual recognition of lost time, though the exact nature of Elias's sacrifice could be clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The garden functions as more than setting—it actively constrains choices through its maze structure and fountain centerpiece that requires the teeth to restore. Vivid sensory details like "ivy and honeysuckle" and "whispers of forgotten seasons" create atmosphere while the fountain's transformation charges the final image. The hedge maze geography remains consistent and pressures the characters' movements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Mara's intellectual curiosity to emotional confrontation when Elias appears, forcing her to risk both understanding and reconciliation. The tooth placement creates genuine tension with uncertain outcome. However, the resolution comes somewhat easily once both teeth are placed—the garden's immediate forgiveness lacks sufficient resistance to feel fully earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The mirror metaphor emerges organically from the action, reweighting the garden from trickster space to reflection of internal states. The teeth as bridges "to us" rather than to the fae subverts expectation meaningfully. The final image of the cleared path physicalizes forgiveness without stating it, though some thematic statements like "mistakes are just constellations" edge toward over-articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's perceptual signature shows through her skeptical testing of thorns and analytical approach to the fountain. Dialogue carries subtext effectively, particularly Elias's "You still think you can outsmart the garden?" which wounds while revealing history. Some filter verbs ("Mara frowned," "she murmured") slightly dull immediacy during peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between description and action. Information density is generally strong, with lines like "Its jagged edge had once cut her thumb, a reminder that even the unreal could bleed" doing multiple jobs. Minor redundancies appear ("crumbling stone"/"crumbling fountain") and some metaphors edge toward overwriting ("tapestry of memories").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The changeling tooth as key to human connection rather than fae magic offers a fresh angle on portal fantasy tropes. The bone-setting metaphor for realigning magical dislocation shows originality. However, the reconciliation arc follows familiar patterns, and the garden-as-mirror concept, while well-executed, doesn't fully transform its archetypal roots.</comment>
