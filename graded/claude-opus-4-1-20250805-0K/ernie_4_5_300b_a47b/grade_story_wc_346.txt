<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between doubt and duty manifests through concrete embodied details like "hands calloused from decades" and her singing voice "rough, unpracticed." The final choice to embrace her flaws and continue singing despite the pane cracking shows contradictory impulses acting in scene with visible cost. Loses points for some abstract emotional labeling ("strange peace") and the grandfather's wisdom feeling slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure as Mara's lullaby transforms global time perception. The cost is legible in the lighthouse groaning, pane cracking, and puppet head shattering. Strong causality through grandfather's teachings leading to this moment, though the world-building mechanics of "doomsday clock adjuster" remain slightly vague.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting constrains choices effectively—the spiral stairs, rusted railing, and pane of hush all shape Mara's actions. Sensory details like "salt and decay" and the glass humming create atmosphere. However, the broader world remains abstract; we don't feel the specific place beyond the lighthouse itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: glass humming → patterns shifting → memories flooding → lighthouse shuddering → pane cracking. The dominant stake (gentle vs violent apocalypse) faces meaningful deepening when Mara must accept her flaws to complete the task. Cost is visible in the destruction of the puppet head and pane.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the grandfather's "cracks let the light in" philosophy, paid off when the puppet's cracks leak golden light. The final image of the lullaby as "beautifully flawed, sung across a thousand lifetimes" offers a non-literal answer to mortality's nature. Avoids moralizing while embracing complexity about perfection and endings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("measured steps of someone who knew the weight of seconds"). Some elevated diction fits the mythic tone though occasionally drifts toward purple prose. The POV remains stable and the perceptual signature consistent, though dialogue absence prevents full assessment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and strong imagery. However, several instances of elevated abstraction ("spectral glow," "fractal of fractals") and some repetitive phrasing around time/lullaby concepts. The "insects in amber" simile and nested patterns description risk overwriting but don't fully obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of apocalyptic and tender elements—a doomsday clock adjuster who ensures gentle endings through lullabies. The broken puppet head as navigation tool and the pane of hush concept show genuine invention. Transforms the end-times trope through specific emotional texture though some world-building remains generic.</comment>
