<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to discover what walls dream about drives consistent choices throughout, with concrete embodied details like "throat tightened" and "legs unsteady." The transformation from seeking external dreams to understanding "the dreams were not separate from her own" feels earned through specific discoveries. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract epiphany about being "the map" without more embodied cost in that final moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through diary discoveries leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira becomes "the map." The closure lands with felt cost as she burns the film negative and accepts the legacy's burden. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in opening lines. The locket discovery provides meaningful deepening that reweights her grandmother's role.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage functions as more than backdrop—walls that "hum," "shift," and "grind like teeth" constrain Lira's choices and create pressure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "wet earth and iron," "soot-stained glass." The setting actively participates in closure when the ivy parts to reveal the locket. Climate shift context grounds the world rules consistently.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering walls' dreams/understanding legacy) signals early and deepens through diary discoveries that narrow Lira's understanding from external to internal. The walls' grinding creates physical pressure mid-scene. Cost becomes visible when she burns the film negative, accepting the burden. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length, though the final "you are the map" revelation could use more concrete pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete discoveries—diaries revealing "The legacy's burden is not in the keeping, but in the sharing." The film negative transforms from empty relic to sacrificial offering. The recurring map motif (corridor as spine of map, cartographer ancestor, locket's etched map) accumulates meaning. Final whisper "You are the map" reweights prior material, though it edges toward explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lira notices textures "sensitively perceptive" and moves "as if tracing the spine of a forgotten map." Voice maintains consistency through stress, with controlled modulation during the walls' groaning. Some elevated diction ("ivy-veiled," "vaulted ceiling") fits the literary tone. Minor filter verb clusters ("she sensed," "she glimpsed") slightly dull immediacy in middle section.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density high in discoveries: "brittle paper, melted wax, the jagged edge of a copper locket." Some metaphorical density in opening ("curved like a question mark," "spine of a forgotten map") serves accumulative design. Minor template cadence in "She'd come... She carried... She stopped" sequence and slight overwriting in "ancient and alive."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate fiction with architectural memory creates non-obvious angle. The concept of a "corridor echo cartographer" mapping walls' dreams shows genuine originality. Specific details like film negative with "no images, only a faint imprint of light" avoid generic symbolism. The grandmother-as-predecessor revelation reweights the journey without feeling derivative, though the "you are the map" ending risks abstraction.</comment>
