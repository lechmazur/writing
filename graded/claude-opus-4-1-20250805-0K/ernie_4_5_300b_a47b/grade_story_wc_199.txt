<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elinor's motivation is clear and rooted in her orderly nature, with concrete embodied actions (calloused hands, precise sorting). The transformation from skeptic to believer feels earned through specific experience with the moonstone dust. However, internal conflict remains largely implicit rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the emotional progression toward "mossy delight" could use more embodied complexity beyond the smile.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (monuments, falling leaves, moonstone trail) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elinor accepts her role as decoder. The closure lands with implied cost (accepting responsibility for warnings/seeking Lirael) and the "emerged transformed always" motif pays off. Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words. Minor deduction for cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor functions as more than backdrop—its branches, moss, and edges constrain Elinor's movements and provide materials for her monuments. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (mossy green haze, dappled shadows). The setting's transformation (ashen sky softening to gold) mirrors the internal shift. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as Elinor moves from worktable to arbor's edge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (decoding the message) is signaled early and deepens through the moonstone discovery and monument-building sequence. Escalation follows the accumulative lens as density increases—dust trail leads to monuments which draw leaves whose messages become readable. However, the resolution lacks visceral cost; accepting three tasks (harvest, warn, seek) doesn't show meaningful trade-offs or foreclosed options on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete interplay of order/mystery, past/prophecy, and forgotten/remembered. The monuments to forgotten things work as both literal action and thematic resonance. The ending offers a non-literal answer about bridging seen/unseen worlds through patient attention. Minor deduction for the slightly neat resolution where all mysteries resolve without lingering ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with Elinor's orderly perspective coloring every observation (seeds in "neat rows," "meticulously arranged"). Voice modulates effectively from routine precision to wonder. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance shifts are controlled, moving closer during the monument-building. Minor filter verb usage ("she believed," "she knew") doesn't significantly dull immediacy given the reflective mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythmic variety and information density, with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Particularly effective: "Her hands, calloused from decades of sorting grains and seeds by weight, color, and origin, knew the rhythm of the floating island's heart." Some minor repetitive phrasing around "she knew" in the final paragraphs. Opening and closing lines effectively bracket the transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of seed-sorting precision with mystical message-decoding offers a fresh angle on prophecy stories. The specific detail of building monuments from seeds/stones/bark to decode leaf messages shows originality. The floating arbor setting avoids generic fantasy tropes. However, the resolution feels somewhat safe—all problems receive tidy solutions without meaningful ambiguity or risk.</comment>
