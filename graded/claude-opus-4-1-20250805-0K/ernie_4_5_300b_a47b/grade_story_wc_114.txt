I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered images and metaphors toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lirael's internal contradiction between oracle precision and post-fever uncertainty drives authentic choices, particularly her decision to leave with the botanical illustration. The "swallowed truth" metaphor effectively embodies her psychological burden. Minor deduction for the director character remaining somewhat functional rather than applying immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lirael's acceptance of uncertainty ("learned to sway... let the margins occupy her"), with visible cost in abandoning her role. The accumulative lens holds as botanical imagery, margins, and fault-tolerance build toward the ending's reconfiguration. Slight weakness in the quarantine folder reveal, which could have been more dramatically integrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mountain station constrains choices effectively—the isolation forces Lirael's confrontation with truth, and the botanical illustration functions as micro-setting that shapes her final decision. Sensory details like "windows rattling," "metallic tang," and "cold glass" ground the abstract conflict. The auroral imagery charges the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from internal uncertainty through discovering the quarantine folder to the decisive departure. The dominant stake—whether to maintain oracle certainty or embrace margin-dwelling truth—tightens effectively. Cost is visible in leaving her position and the director's coming rage, though middle pressure could intensify.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the fault-tolerance/margin-occupying metaphor without explicit moralizing. The bearberry's ability to grow "where the world shows its cracks" resonates perfectly with Lirael's transformation. The final image of feeling "whole" through accepting fragmentation offers a non-literal answer to the story's central question about truth and certainty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Lirael's focus on margins, edges, and botanical details. The prose modulates effectively from analytical precision to more fragmented perception under stress. Minor dialogue between Lirael and the herbalist feels slightly convenient, though the director's earlier line lands well.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though some passages lean toward overwriting ("celestial shroud," "auroral sorrow"). Template cadence appears in "She'd started... She'd dreamed... She'd forgotten" sequence. Information density is good, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "fault-tolerant oracle" concept offers fresh tension between systematic prediction and human fallibility. The botanical illustration as a map of personal fractures provides original metaphorical work. While the whistleblower arc is familiar, the specific synthesis through margin-dwelling and bearberry resilience feels distinctive.</comment>
