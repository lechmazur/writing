I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Hybrid (Causal dominant with Accumulative elements). The story follows causal linkages (tile discovery → chamber opening → covenant sealing) while accumulating symbolic resonance through the frugality motif and mathematical/celestial patterns.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's frugality-as-armor motivation is consistent and drives her choices, particularly in "counting coppers now wielding a relic." The internal arc from skepticism to acceptance of mystery lands with earned cost ("Some truths were too vast for telescopes"). However, the disembodied voice lacks embodied presence, and Elara's quick acceptance of the mystical elements feels slightly unearned given her established pragmatism.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear causal chain from tile discovery through chamber revelation to covenant acceptance, with Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara transforms from seeking external answers to internal dialogue. Cost is visible in accepting limitations of empirical knowledge ("The covenant wasn't with the unknown, but with herself"). Orientation anchors established early, though the voice's nature remains deliberately ambiguous.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Babylonian palace setting provides atmospheric texture with "dust-caked stone walls" and "sandstone arches framing a sky streaked with amber and violet." The tiles constrain choices and enable progression. However, the bioluminescent chamber feels generic, and spatial choreography occasionally blurs during the tile manipulation sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering celestial secrets vs. accepting uncertainty) established early and tightens when the tile reveals "a mirror" of intentions rather than answers. The escalation from physical exploration to philosophical acceptance works, though the disembodied voice reduces tangible opposition. Cost lands in accepting questions over answers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the irony of a frugal astronomer finding faith in numbers rather than stars. The tile-as-mirror metaphor effectively reweights prior material, transforming from key to self-reflection. "Some truths were too vast for telescopes" resonates without moralizing, though the covenant concept could be more precisely developed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive voice combining scientific precision and poetic observation ("dusky harmony," "void's indifference"). Dialogue between Elara and the voice maintains appropriate register. Some filter verb accumulation ("She recognized," "She felt") dulls immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Strong opening and closing lines. However, several instances of telling over showing ("The irony wasn't lost on her"), some abstract phrasing ("infinitely patient, like a star waiting for its orbit"), and occasional overwriting in descriptive passages reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The frugal astronomer finding mystical truth in mathematics offers a fresh angle on the science-vs-faith trope. The tile-as-mirror twist provides genuine surprise. However, the mysterious voice and magical chamber feel somewhat conventional, and the resolution's philosophical nature, while earned, lacks bold specificity.</comment>
