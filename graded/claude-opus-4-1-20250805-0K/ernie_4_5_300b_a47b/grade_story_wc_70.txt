<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clara's involuntary truthfulness creates genuine internal conflict that drives her final choice to "weaponize" her candor. The transformation from social pariah to catalyst for wonder shows earned change with visible cost—her vulnerability in public speaking. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("social pariah," "weaponize") that briefly abstracts rather than embodies her state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds from routine tallying to collective wonder restoration, with the lacquer box riddle serving as the pivotal revelation. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Clara's new role transforms the city's relationship with wonder, with cost visible in her exposed vulnerability. Slight weakness in the convenience of Voss appearing exactly when needed, though the pattern coheres well overall.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lightning tower and its copper cables create atmospheric pressure, while the drones-as-pollinators concept constrains the story's logic effectively. "Nectar dusk" pays off beautifully in the closing image of golden, syrupy light. Deduction for some generic city descriptions early on and the "glass booth" that doesn't meaningfully constrain choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring collective wonder to save the city's power—escalates from personal observation to public action with clear cost. Clara's shift from passive keeper to active catalyst shows agency, and the city's disbelief creates genuine pressure. The resolution feels slightly mechanical in how quickly the city responds to her speech, reducing tension at the closure moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the drones' dual function and the riddle's answer being "you"—making wonder a collective responsibility. The final image of nectar dusk light as honey-dipped world resonates without stating a moral. Strong integration of wonder-as-infrastructure concept that reweights the entire tower system.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clara's voice maintains consistency with her involuntary truthfulness coloring perception ("It tastes like regret"). The shift to public speaking mode feels earned given her character. Some register drift into explanatory mode during Voss's exposition weakens the middle section's immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, particularly in the descriptive passages. Deductions for filter-verb clustering ("Clara thought," "Clara frowned," "She hesitated") and some template cadence in dialogue tags. The "nectar dusk" description shows strong imagistic control that elevates the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of wonder-powered infrastructure offers fresh inflection on both magical realism and urban fantasy. The drones as pollinators of doubt/curiosity transforms expected mechanical imagery. Risk-taking in making collective belief a literal power source pays off, though execution occasionally defaults to familiar beats.</comment>
