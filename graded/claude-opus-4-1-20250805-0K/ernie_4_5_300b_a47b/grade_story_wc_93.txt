<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's internal conflict between understanding and controlling the patterns creates genuine tension, with her precognitive curse showing contradictory futures that force meaningful choices. The final realization that she must witness rather than control represents earned character growth with visible cost—the acceptance of uncertainty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lira's shift from trying to control patterns to witnessing them, with clear cost in accepting the storm vision's threat. The accumulative lens holds as pattern-work builds through rock sequences toward the final understanding, though the midpoint could tighten further.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frictionless water and suspended eels create a unique constraint that shapes Lira's choices throughout. Aurora light revealing sacred geometries on eel bodies is particularly strong, though some descriptive passages ("liquid green and violet") lean generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through mathematical sequences (Fibonacci to Pascal's to Möbius) with each attempt raising stakes through increasingly dangerous visions. The storm threat provides coherent pressure, though the resolution's ease slightly undercuts the established danger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of witnessing versus controlling emerges organically through Lira's struggle with the patterns, avoiding explicit moralizing until earned by action. The final line about learning to listen resonates without feeling imposed, reweighting the mother's promise meaningfully.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with evocative imagery fitting the mystical tone, though some phrases ("second skin," "salt spray") feel stock. The perceptual signature of someone seeing fragmented futures could be more distinctively rendered in syntax and rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Several instances of overwriting diminish momentum: "bruise-purple" and metaphor density in high-pressure beats. Template cadence appears in "She placed...The star dust...The eels..." sequence, and "living sigil" strains credibility without clearer grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The mathematical sequence approach to herding eels offers freshness, combining mystical and systematic elements effectively. However, the resolution feels somewhat safe—the insight arrives through relatively low-cost trial rather than genuine struggle or sacrifice.</comment>
