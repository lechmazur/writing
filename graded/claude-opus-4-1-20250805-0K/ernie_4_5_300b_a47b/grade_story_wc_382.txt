<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characters have clear motivations rooted in the mystery of the library's true nature, with Elias's expertise and the woman's patient manipulation creating genuine tension. The internal conflict between skepticism and belief manifests concretely as Elias must decide whether to speak the "language of old buildings." However, the woman's characterization remains somewhat thin beyond her role as mysterious guide, and the emotional stakes of their prior relationship ("weekly tea sessions") feel underdeveloped for the weight they're meant to carry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Charged Poise closure where Elias speaks to the building and receives an answer, crystallizing the moment of transformation with the library's shudder and responding voice. The causal chain from cryptic note to seal to revelation to action holds coherently. The cost—accepting the impossible and risking failure or madness—is implied through the physical sensations ("teeth ache") and the finality of the act, though it could be more viscerally rendered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rooftop garden with wisteria and string lights creates immediate atmosphere, while the library's dome with "glass panels fracturing the starlight" provides a vivid climactic setting. The building itself functions as setting-as-character, with its groans and whispers constraining choices and the specific date (1885 vs 1892) mattering to the mystery. The meteor shower times the ritual perfectly, making environment essential to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity about the seal to the revelation of the building's sentient nature, with the meteor shower creating temporal pressure for action. The dominant stake—whether to believe and act on impossible knowledge—tightens as evidence accumulates. However, the actual consequences of speaking to the building remain vague ("somewhere, deep in its walls, a voice answered"), limiting the felt cost of the choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of "agreed upon lies" protecting deeper truths resonates throughout, from the false dates to the ultimate lie they must tell the building ("we're ready"). The concept that buildings have languages and memories offers fresh metaphorical weight. The final image of the library answering reweights all prior mentions of its groans and whispers, though the story's ultimate stance on truth versus protective fiction could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong narrative voice with distinctive diction ("dialects of stone and timber," "patience was the currency of their trade") that maintains consistency throughout. Dialogue carries subtext effectively, particularly in the sugar-borrowing revelation that recontextualizes their relationship. The shift to embodied sensation when Elias speaks the building's language ("not from his throat, but from his bones") demonstrates excellent control of psychic distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with evocative phrases like "wisteria vines curled around wrought-iron benches" doing multiple jobs. Sentence variety and rhythm support the mysterious atmosphere without overwriting. Minor weakness in the rushed final paragraph where "somewhere, deep in its walls" feels vague compared to the story's earlier precision, and "dust rained from the rafters" borders on cliché.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of a "dead language tutor" who specializes in "dialects of stone and timber" offers genuine freshness, transforming the familiar haunted building trope through specific expertise. The seal as a key that works only during meteor showers adds original world-building. The twist that they must lie to the building inverts expectations cleverly, though the execution of the final moment could push further into unexplored territory.</comment>
