<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's motivation crystallizes from personal mystery to inherited mission with embodied tension ("fingers trembled," "tears blurred"). The arc from solitary decoder to community teacher shows genuine transformation with visible cost—her grandmother's decades of absence. Internal conflict between chasing ghosts and finding purpose resolves through concrete discovery, though some emotional beats lean toward summary ("Tears blurred Lira's vision").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira accepts her grandmother's legacy, transforming from decoder to teacher with the cost of confronting familial loss. The causal chain holds: chalk patterns → margin codes → fountain discovery → inheritance accepted. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~50 words. The microchip revelation and hologram payoff earn their emotional weight through prior setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The golden arcade functions as both marketplace and archive, constraining Lira's search to specific locations (fountain's hidden compartment). Sensory detail layers effectively ("honeyed streaks," "prismatic patterns"). The futuristic-nostalgic blend serves the story's core tension between digital collapse and analog resistance. Setting actively shapes the final discovery—the fountain's light frequency matching chalk codes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from decoding curiosity to family legacy, with the three-year mystery creating sustained pressure. The fountain discovery represents meaningful tightening as disparate clues converge. Cost registers in the grandmother's absence and Lira's tears, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly without significant opposition or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of resistance through obsolete media emerges organically from plot events. The chalk codes embody the story's core insight: survival encoded in what endures. The ending reweights the arcade from commerce hub to resistance archive without explicit moralizing. "Futuristic nostalgia wasn't about clinging to the past—it was about reinventing it" borders on thesis statement but earns its placement through prior dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent techno-poetic register with selective perception ("ebony clipboard," "synth-coffee"). POV stays firmly with Lira throughout. Dialogue from vendor and carrier feels functional rather than distinctive. Some filter phrases ("Lira frowned," "She ignored him") slightly distance the reader during key moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with occasional elevation ("dawn's first light," "honeyed streaks"). Some repetitive structures appear ("Lira knelt," "Lira frowned," "Lira hurried"). Information density varies—the opening's rich description contrasts with more functional middle passages. The hologram section contains slight paraphrase loops ("if you're watching this" followed by explanatory summary).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of resistance encoded in children's chalk drawings offers fresh angle on post-digital collapse. Combining pseudonym creation with cryptographic inheritance adds specificity. The transformation from mysterious letter to family legacy feels earned through accumulated detail, though the hologram reveal follows somewhat predictable emotional beats.</comment>
