<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to resurrect stories from silence is grounded in necessity and embodied through concrete actions—transcribing fragments, adjusting dials, scribbling lyrics. Her internal experience layers nostalgia for her father with determination for her quest, though the piece lacks a decisive character-altering choice at closure, settling instead for continuation of established patterns.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through repeated broadcast fragments and moss glow patterns toward a Charged Poise ending where Lira steps into night as "a pirate broadcaster in her own right." While the final image reweights her role from receiver to transmitter, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—we see dedication but not sacrifice or foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ember alcove with its bioluminescent moss veins creates a vivid micro-setting that both shelters and illuminates Lira's work, while the ashen plains and mist function as atmospheric pressure. Sensory details like "air tasted of iron and memory" and the cedar-scented cloak are POV-filtered and purposeful, though the setting doesn't quite constrain her final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on Lira's quest to recover lost stories, with pressure building through the elusive broadcast signals that "flickered in and out of existence." The story deepens through accumulating fragments ("The dust remembers," "The wind carries secrets") but lacks a meaningful tightening that would foreclose options or force a trade-off with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of listening to static for stories, with the dust-teaching metaphor earning resonance through repetition and variation. The final image of Lira stepping out to "teach the dust to sing" offers a non-literal answer to recovering narrative after famine, though it stops short of revealing new complexity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with controlled rhythm ("ember alcove where mist curled like smoke") and character-specific perception (musical transcription informing how she decodes lyrics). The prose modulates effectively between action and reflection, though occasional elevated diction ("thistled calm wrapping around her") slightly exceeds the POV's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks, with lines often doing double work (the cloak both shields and connects to memory). Some figurative density in quieter moments ("cocoon," "second skin," "halo of light" in quick succession) and minor template cadence ("She'd collect...she'd have...she'd weave") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of pirate radio broadcasts carrying story fragments after a "story famine" offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic recovery, focusing on narrative rather than physical survival. The synthesis of musical transcription skills with radio listening creates specificity, though the execution remains somewhat safe in its resolution.</comment>
