I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - The story builds through layered memories, sensory details (whale songs), and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Clara embraces mystery over skepticism.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clara's transformation from "sympathetic skeptic" to wonder-embracer is earned through embodied discovery and Aelia's memories. The internal contradiction between skepticism and curiosity plays out concretely through her actions with the tile. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("heart racing") rather than pure embodiment in transition moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Clara's skepticism "softened by wonder" represents a genuine stance shift with visible cost (her scientific worldview yielding to mystery). The accumulative structure coheres through whale songs, memories, and transcription building to this reconfiguration. Orientation anchors established cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tower setting actively constrains and enables Clara's discovery, with the cliff location, whale migration timing, and historical resonance all essential to the narrative. Sensory layering of whale songs creates atmospheric pressure throughout. The tile as micro-setting object becomes indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative density - whale songs intensify, memories flood, transcription accelerates - building pressure toward Clara's worldview shift. The cost is her skeptical framework yielding to wonder. One significant deepening through Aelia's memories that reweight Clara's understanding satisfies this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of connection across time and embracing mystery over pure logic emerges organically through concrete action. The ending reweights prior skepticism without stating a moral - Clara's smile and decision to keep the tile close shows transformation through gesture. Aelia's persistence despite ostracization parallels Clara's own isolation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception fitting Clara's scientific-yet-searching mindset. Some filter verb clusters ("Clara felt," "She realized") in middle sections reduce immediacy. Strong perceptual signature in how she notices patterns and celestial details.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several paraphrase loops weaken density: "songs meant for ears long gone"/"unheard symphonies" and repeated whale song descriptions. Template cadence appears in "She'd come here... She traced... She picked up" sequence. Information density could be higher in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-objects with stargazing creates non-obvious resonance. The magic square tile as bridge between seekers across centuries offers genuine originality. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure pays off, though some elements (whale songs as backdrop) feel slightly conventional.</comment>
