<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation to translate isolation into independence is clear and drives her choices, particularly in her declaration "I see you...But I am not you." The character shows genuine internal conflict between connection to her extinct kin and need for autonomy. However, the transformation from passive observer to active writer feels somewhat unearned—the leap to documenting lacks sufficient causal pressure from prior beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Lirael shifts from coexistence to pioneering, with visible cost in releasing her connection to her species' collective. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through the sundial's revelations and library transformations. However, the causality between touching the sundial and the library's physical changes lacks clear mechanics, and the cost of independence could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually stated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tidal library's coral walls and moon-swaying shelves create a vivid, otherworldly setting that actively shapes Lirael's journey. Setting details like "ink shimmered like liquid starlight" and the stone circle's hum effectively constrain and enable choices. The library's transformation provides new tools that directly enable her final stance as writer-pioneer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake of independence versus isolation is signaled early but escalation remains gentle—the sundial's glow and library's transformation happen to Lirael rather than resulting from her agency. The hum's crescendo provides texture but doesn't force difficult trade-offs. The final choice to write lacks opposition or visible cost beyond the abstract "coexistence" already achieved.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of independence from collective identity emerges organically through Lirael's journey from "brittle awakening" to pioneer. The spiral symbol and title "Brittle Awakenings" effectively reweight earlier material. However, the resolution tends toward explicit statement ("pioneer of the living") rather than allowing the image alone to carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the fantastical setting, with controlled rhythm in passages like "woolly rhinos, dodo birds, and her own ancestors, their forms dissolving like smoke." POV remains stable and the perceptual signature of noticing extinction and transformation is distinct. Some filter phrases ("Lirael realized," "she knew") slightly dull immediacy in crucial moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative imagery and varied sentence structures. Information density is moderate—most lines advance atmosphere or concept. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("She would document...She would write," "coexist/coexisted" repetition) and some abstract telling ("Her motivation was clear") replaces potential scene work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tidal library above clouds offers a fresh setting, and the concept of a being splintered from collective consciousness shows originality. The transformation of extinction into creative independence provides a non-obvious angle. However, the resolution into "writer discovers purpose" follows a familiar arc that somewhat diminishes the premise's uniqueness.</comment>
