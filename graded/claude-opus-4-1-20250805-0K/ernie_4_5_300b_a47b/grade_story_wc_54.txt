I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and consistent—transforming broken systems through functional creativity—and her final choice to repurpose the terminal shows genuine agency. However, her internal experience lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; she moves too smoothly from discovery to solution without embodied struggle or genuine doubt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lila's transformation of the terminal from decay to purposeful light, with cost visible in the "raw, untested" equation requiring future validation. The causal lens holds as each discovery leads to the next action, though the sextant's cosmic properties feel somewhat convenient rather than earned through prior setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal setting is vivid with specific details like "skeletal ticketing booths" and "rusted luggage carousels," and moonlight pooling through shattered glass creates atmosphere. However, the environment doesn't sufficiently constrain choices—Lila moves through the space without spatial obstacles affecting her tactics, missing opportunities for the setting to pressure her decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of proving "fractured systems could be redirected" is signaled early and tested when Lila recalibrates the terminal's systems. The escalation from finding the sextant to activating dormant infrastructure shows agency, but lacks a meaningful tightening that forecloses options—she achieves her goal without sacrificing alternatives or facing genuine opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of resurrection through repurposing emerges organically from Lila's actions, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the equation "etched into her memory" while the terminal dims offers a non-literal answer about hope requiring continuous refinement, though the thematic exploration could dig deeper into the cost of transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with purposeful diction like "functional creativity" and "redirected flows" that reflects Lila's engineering mindset. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—descriptions feel competent but generic rather than filtered through Lila's specific way of noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose flows clearly with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks, avoiding major artifacts or loops. However, several passages trend toward overwriting with stacked metaphors ("maze of intentions," "equation for hope," "hypothesis waiting for validation") that dilute impact, and some filter constructions like "Lila's breath caught" reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The concept of an engineer repurposing abandoned infrastructure shows moderate freshness, transforming the typical "find the artifact" quest into creative problem-solving. However, the execution relies on familiar beats—mysterious hum, flickering lights, dawn departure—without sufficient transformation to feel truly distinctive.</comment>
