<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation to reawaken dormant stories is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment through her handling of the scarf and physical entry into the impossible space. The transformation from restlessness to quiet confidence lands with visible change. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene—her eccentric beliefs face no genuine resistance or cost, and the epiphany about hyperbolic geometry as "key" arrives without sufficient struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Eleanor's restlessness building through sensory details toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when she accesses the space where stories live. The closure lands with her transformed presence affecting the library's vitality. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt—we see change but not what Eleanor sacrifices or risks to achieve it, weakening the before/after legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The library setting actively shapes Eleanor's choices through specific details like the Edison bulbs, leather-bound volumes, and floating manuscripts that constrain her path to revelation. The hyperbolic geometry diagrams function as tools enabling the transformation. The silk scarf serves as micro-setting, its texture and scent grounding each beat while charging the final image when it whispers "Continue."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Eleanor's need to reawaken dormant stories—is signaled early and deepens through her midnight ritual. The shimmer and rippling floor provide textural escalation under the Accumulative lens. However, no genuine opposition or trade-off emerges; Eleanor achieves her goal without visible price or foreclosed options, and the transformation occurs through discovery rather than costly choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of analog versus digital memory emerges through concrete details like the scarf's "raised threads" and the poet's claim to "fold time like origami." The final poem offers resonant non-literal answer about seeking stories "in the curves of your mind." However, the resolution tends toward tidy satisfaction—Eleanor finds exactly what she seeks without ambiguity or lingering questions about the cost of bridging seen/unseen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eleanor's perceptual signature is distinct—she notices "raised threads," thinks in terms of "analog memories," and perceives books as "living things." The prose modulates effectively from measured observation to heightened awareness during the transformation. The dialogue between Eleanor and the patron feels natural with appropriate subtext about impossibility, though the internal poem's diction doesn't quite match Eleanor's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose maintains clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the transformation sequence. Information density is generally strong—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme simultaneously. However, some paraphrase loops appear ("stories weren't just words on a page but living things" echoes similar sentiments), and phrases like "sanely eccentric" repeat without evolution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of a library where stories exist as "vibrations in the air" offers fresh angle on familiar magical realism. The hyperbolic geometry as method for accessing impossible spaces shows genuine ingenuity. The synthesis of mathematical concepts with poetic vision creates non-obvious resonance, though the transformation itself—stepping through to find floating manuscripts—lands somewhat predictably once the mechanism is established.</comment>
