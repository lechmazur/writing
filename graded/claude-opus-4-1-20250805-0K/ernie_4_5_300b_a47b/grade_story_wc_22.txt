I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration where hope emerges from ruin.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The coachman's transformation from soldier to gardener carries genuine weight, with his motivation rooted in the reef's death and his belief in "submerged concord." His micro-choices (scattering seeds, mixing fertilizer, listening to birds) reveal consistent values. The internal complexity of hope amid ruin lands effectively, though some passages lean toward therapeutic clarity ("Time was a language he'd learned to speak fluently").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where "The battlefield was becoming a garden" crystallizes the transformation with clear cost (the reef's death, years of patient work ahead). The accumulative structure coheres through bird language, seed-planting, and memory. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay (coachman's identity emerges gradually) but this serves the textural approach.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming jetty setting directly constrains choices ("where saltwater and freshwater collided, a place where life struggled"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("salt and decay," "violet and gold" flowers). The environment actively shapes tactics through bird calls guiding planting depth and watering. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from jetty edge to sand work to departure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reclaiming battlefield through garden) intensifies through accumulating details rather than reversals, fitting the textural lens. The bird's "Khalis" message deepens meaning effectively. Cost is visible in the reef's death and the slow, patient work required. Escalation could be stronger - the storm gathering adds atmosphere but doesn't fundamentally alter options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of garden-from-battlefield without explicit moralizing. "Submerged concord" works as both concept and lived practice. The final whisper "The earth remembers" resonates without explaining. Bird language as bridge between death and renewal adds genuine depth. Minor deduction for slightly convenient alignment of all thematic elements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled lyricism ("twilight seeped," "roots seeking purchase"). POV remains stable with appropriate focalization. The shift to elevated diction in reflective passages ("narrow vastness of hope") fits the coachman's learned background. Some register elevation in peak moments ("the space between breaths") but it's character-motivated through his linguistic expertise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good - most lines advance multiple story elements. Some overwriting appears ("tiny, pale roots," "sharp and insistent") and metaphorical density occasionally peaks high ("The earth remembers" following extensive garden metaphor). Template cadence emerges briefly ("He reached... He tilted... He reached") but doesn't pervade.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of environmental restoration through ancient linguistic knowledge offers genuine freshness. The specific detail of bird calls as soil guidance system transforms familiar eco-fiction tropes. The coachman's soldier-to-gardener arc avoids sentimentality through concrete action. Risk-taking in the lyrical approach mostly succeeds, though some passages edge toward the poetic-abstract.</comment>
