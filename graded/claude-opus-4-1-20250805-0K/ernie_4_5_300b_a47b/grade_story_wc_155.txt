<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to rediscover lost joy drives concrete choices throughout, from displaying the fragment to creating the light-mural gathering. Her internal shift from "quiet elegies" to fighting back with "stubborn, glorious joy" is earned through specific experience with the community response. The embodied reactions—fingers itching, chest tight, hands trembling—avoid stock gestures while tracking emotional progression.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the orchard transforms from "lost" to "found" through communal rediscovery, with visible cost in years of isolation overcome. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases from solitary art-making to collective celebration, with the fresco fragment catalyzing pattern breaks. Who/where/when anchored early ("ruined orchard district," "Lira," "One morning"), and causality tracks from finding fragment to display to community resurrection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fog functions as both atmosphere and antagonist, "clinging like second skin" and trying to "swallow" joy, directly constraining choices and charging the final confrontation. Vivid sensory work beyond visual—"peaches tasted like sunshine," violin strings "humming," children's "giggles piercing silence"—creates lived-in specificity. The greenhouse studio with "shattered panes" and "moss-choked paths" grounds action while the environment actively shapes tactics (using prisms/mirrors against fog).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal artistic expression to community resurrection as Lira's display unexpectedly triggers recognition ("That's my mother") and collective participation. The fog's attempt to "smother" life creates coherent opposition that "thins, as if embarrassed" when confronted. Cost is legible in "years" of silence broken and Lira's trembling realization that she'd "forgotten how to smile until the world reminded her."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the extended metaphor of undeveloped film requiring light to reveal what was "waiting in the dark," never stated directly but embodied in action. The fresco fragment's laughter becomes amplified "as if by the fog itself," creating resonant irony. The final image of a child asking "What's next?" and Lira answering "Everything" offers a non-literal answer to the question of how joy persists through decay.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Lira notices light and color ("stolen sunbeam," "streaks of gold and violet") reflects her artist's eye. Voice modulates effectively from lyrical description to intimate revelation ("You're a message," she whispered"). The prose rhythm accelerates during the celebration scene through shorter, active sentences, then slows for reflection without losing texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly lands—"fog clung to her like a second skin," "silence had seeped into her bones"—though occasional elevation risks purple prose ("reckless, giddy hope"). Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs, as when "The orchard's silence had seeped into her bones, turning her art into quiet elegies." Minor repetition of "fog" and "light" stays purposeful given thematic weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of light-art in fog-shrouded ruins offers a non-obvious angle on community revival stories, with specific details like "encrypted notes left in hollow trees" avoiding generic post-apocalyptic templates. The revelation that the fragment depicts Marla's mother transforms ornament into lived history. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode and accumulative structure serves the material without obscuring clarity.</comment>
