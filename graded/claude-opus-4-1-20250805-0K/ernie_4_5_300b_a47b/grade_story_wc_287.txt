<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "reflect light into dark corners" drives consistent choices throughout, and his patient cultivation of beauty in harsh spaces defines his character. The final choice to enter Mara's shop and open her window demonstrates agency with emotional cost. However, Mara remains underdeveloped beyond her grief label, and the transformation feels slightly unearned given the limited dramatization of their prior relationship.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward Mara accepting light, achieving Resonant Reconfiguration when she "let the light in." The cost is visible in her years of darkness and Elias's persistent efforts. However, the closure's emotional weight relies heavily on telling ("for the first time in years") rather than embodied demonstration, and the final line about the waiting rosebush feels detached from the immediate scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The fire escape garden and harbor setting actively shape Elias's worldview and methods, with the bitting gauge tooth functioning as micro-setting that constrains his approach to helping Mara. Sensory details like "salt and diesel" and "metal groaning beneath his boots" create atmosphere. The moonlight becomes instrumental in the final moment of transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—bringing light to darkness—is clear early and deepens when Elias decides to try again with Mara despite past failure. The pressure builds modestly through his descent to the docks and approach to her shop. However, escalation remains gentle without significant opposition or cost until the final acceptance, limiting dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of persistence through darkness emerges through concrete actions: tending fire escape gardens, leaving geraniums, creating rhythms in the night. The bitting gauge as a tool for "measuring light" offers resonance. However, Elias's explicit statement "after the final petal drops, you still have to water the stem" veers toward direct moralizing, diminishing subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent POV with selective perception ("calloused hands," focus on small details of persistence). The prose rhythm modulates appropriately from contemplative to active. Brief dialogue feels natural with subtext. However, some phrases like "wistfully pragmatic understanding" and "luminous harbor by moonlight" occasionally drift toward writerly construction over authentic perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose generally flows with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in active sequences. However, several overwrought phrases appear ("quivering hush of the night amplified his resolve," "protected vulnerability hanging in the air like mist") that prioritize atmosphere over clarity. The ending's abstract philosophizing about the rosebush weakens line-level momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The fire escape gardener concept offers a fresh angle on urban resilience, and using the lockmaster's tool as a rhythm-maker shows creativity. However, the widow-who-won't-accept-help trope feels familiar, and the resolution through opening windows/accepting light lacks surprising specificity. The transformation doesn't fully escape predictable emotional territory.</comment>
