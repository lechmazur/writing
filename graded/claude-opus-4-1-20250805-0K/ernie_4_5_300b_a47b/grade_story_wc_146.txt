I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as the piece builds through rhythmic repetition, pattern accumulation, and sensory layering toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation as a "cryptic bell tuner" who believes in revival through patience is clear and consistent. His methodical approach—using the tuning fork to rebuild through rhythm rather than force—demonstrates character-specific problem-solving. The internal consistency holds, though the townsfolk's arrival and transformation feels slightly convenient without showing their individual costs or resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the ghost town transforms into a living chorus through accumulated rhythm. The seven-day progression from single footsteps to full revival follows clear accumulative logic. Cost is visible in Kael's patient waiting and the townsfolk's "gaunt, wary" state transforming to participation, though the mechanism of footsteps creating physical restoration stretches credibility slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The decaying town square with its "fountain choked with weeds" and "clock tower frozen at 3:17" creates vivid specificity that directly constrains Kael's method. The archway frames both entry and exit, functioning as threshold between states. The cobblestones themselves become active setting elements through their rhythmic restoration, with environment directly shaping the method of revival.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative density: from single footsteps to hundreds, from silence to bell-song, from decay to restoration. The seven-day progression provides clear intensification markers (clock ticking, fountain flowing, bell ringing). The dominant stake of revival-through-rhythm deepens appropriately, though the lack of opposition or complication slightly dampens tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between mechanical "lockstep" and organic "chorus," with revival requiring listening rather than forcing. The tuning fork as compass for finding the town's "forgotten heartbeat" resonates without becoming heavy-handed. The final image of Kael departing into "wild hush" while the town finds its pitch behind him creates meaningful ambiguity about cycles of restoration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent mythic-poetic register with strong phrases like "ivy clawed at weathered stone" and "the wild hush of forgotten things." The prose rhythm mirrors the story's thematic concern with pattern and repetition effectively. Some passages edge toward purple prose ("tapestry of shared balance"), and the townsfolk lack distinct voices when they appear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery. Information density is generally high, though some passages contain mild redundancy ("Now, the archway was a skeleton, its purpose erased by time" could be compressed). The "wild hush" motif bookends effectively, and technical clarity remains strong throughout despite the lyrical mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of revival through rhythmic footsteps rather than conventional rebuilding offers a fresh angle on restoration narratives. The bell tuner as protagonist brings specificity, though the magical realism of footsteps physically repairing cobblestones feels somewhat familiar. The piece commits to its premise without retreat, but doesn't quite achieve the transformative originality of higher bands.</comment>
