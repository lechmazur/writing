<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to confront fear is well-rooted in her photographic curse and near-death experience, with the opera cloak providing consistent embodied stakes. The shadow encounter shows contradictory impulses (terror vs. being drawn closer), though Vey's flat characterization and some diagnostic phrasing ("unbosomed her fear") prevent higher scoring. The final choice to grip the burning thread demonstrates cost, but Vey remains more plot device than pressuring agent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkage: curse leads to isolation, near-death awakens cloak's power, paradoxical dictionary guides confrontation, welcoming the shadow dissolves it. Closure lands as Decisive Change when Mara absorbs the shadow's power into the cloak with physical cost (seared skin). The orientation is clean by ~100 words, and the single-scene funhouse maintains unity, though Vey's cryptic final exchange feels slightly detached from the main arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The funhouse setting actively constrains choices through its labyrinthine structure and distorting mirrors that interact with Mara's curse. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("bruise-colored sky," "mirrors slick with condensation," "scent of ozone"). The opera cloak's luminance physically alters the space and the shadow's form, making environment essential to resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from entering the funhouse to confronting the shadow to gripping its burning thread. The paradoxical solution (welcoming what repulses) creates meaningful reversal with visible cost. However, Vey's role as whispering guide reduces some agency, and the shadow's dissolution feels slightly mechanical despite the physical price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox that "fear, like beauty, is a lie" requiring confrontation through acceptance rather than resistance. The dream dictionary's riddles and the cloak's luminance create coherent subtext about inherited wisdom versus lived experience. However, Vey's explicit thematic statement at the end ("The one that survives") edges toward direct moralizing, and the truth/lie binary could embrace more complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara's voice maintains consistency with evocative descriptions filtered through her fractured perception ("eyes like fractured glass" echoed in how she sees). Vey's dialogue carries appropriate coldness and cryptic precision. Some elevated diction ("unbosomed," "repulsive allure") fits the gothic tone, though occasional therapy-speak ("feed it a lie") creates minor register friction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and selective detail without overwriting. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs (the cloak both protects and reveals character history). Minor deductions for some abstract phrasing ("grotesque mosaic of teeth and eyes") and slight repetition of "luminance," but no loops or scaffolding that harm momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The photographic curse as isolation mechanism offers fresh specificity, and the paradoxical solution through the dream dictionary avoids typical confrontation tropes. The funhouse-as-psychological-space is somewhat familiar, but the integration of inherited objects (cloak, dictionary) with personal trauma creates organic synthesis. Risk-taking through the paradox mechanism heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
