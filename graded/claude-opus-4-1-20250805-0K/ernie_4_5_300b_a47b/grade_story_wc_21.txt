<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's retrocognitive gift creates genuine internal conflict as she loses herself in others' memories, with the cost viscerally shown through tears and fraying identity. The choice to trigger the chamber collapse demonstrates agency under pressure, though Elara's ghost feels more like a plot device than a fully realized pressure point.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with Mara destroying the codex and antagonist together ("just bought time"), creating a Decisive Change with visible cost. The causal chain from diary discovery through lagoon visions to tunnel confrontation holds, but the Historical Preservation Society reveal feels abrupt without sufficient groundwork.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon functions as both setting and constraint, with its threshold nature ("Stay past sunset, and you'll stay forever") shaping Mara's choices and the beach debris language creating specific interaction rules. The tunnels and their deadly traps provide concrete spatial pressure for the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from archival discovery to personal dissolution ("her own identity fraying") to confronting systemic erasure, with the lagoon's time limit adding pressure. The final confrontation forces a true sacrifice, though the antagonist's convenient appearance undermines earned escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of historical erasure versus preservation emerges through concrete action—the encrypted diary, vanished spies, and the regime's descendants still hunting. The ending's "just bought time" acknowledges complexity without false resolution, though the skin-bound codex feels symbolically heavy-handed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency through Mara's archival perspective ("ink-stained fingers," attention to documents) and the prose rhythm accelerates appropriately during the tunnel sequence. Dialogue between Mara and Elara carries subtext about sacrifice, though some phrasing trends generic ("The truth's coming out").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("obsidian water reflecting her face like a distorted mirror") but suffers from filter-verb clusters ("she saw it," "she also saw") and some template phrasing. The tunnel sequence maintains momentum despite occasional redundancy in description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The retrocognitive archivist trapped in memory loops while investigating historical erasure offers a fresh synthesis, with the beach debris communication system adding specificity. The familiar "chosen one enters magical realm" structure limits higher originality despite the archival framing.</comment>
