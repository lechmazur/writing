I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural** lens, as it builds through layered imagery (threads, labyrinth, tapestry) toward a resonant reconfiguration where Alaric's self-forgiveness unfreezes the village.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Alaric's guilt and need for redemption drive consistent choices through the tapestry interaction and thread selection. The black thread triggering his memory of failure and his final acceptance that "some threads couldn't be untangled—only woven into something new" shows earned internal change with visible cost. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract resolution of his forgiveness process.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Alaric's self-forgiveness literally unfreezes the village, with cost visible in accepting his failure as permanent. The accumulative structure builds through thread colors, memory, and the woven hush metaphor cohering at the labyrinth's center. Orientation is clear early (exiled tutor, frozen village, labyrinth).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth and frayed tapestry function as both setting and constraint, with threads that must be decoded to solve the curse. Sensory details like "threads pulsed like living veins" and the color-coded emotional threads create specificity. The frozen village with people "trapped mid-gesture, mid-breath" establishes atmosphere while the labyrinth guides Alaric's path to resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from external (unfreezing village) to internal (self-forgiveness) as Alaric winnows the threads and confronts his memory. The black thread moment forces him to face his guilt directly, with cost visible when he accepts that the prince's death created wounds that can only be "woven into something new." The resolution comes through his agency in touching the pedestal and accepting the woven hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The weaving metaphor organically develops the theme of integrating failure into life's pattern rather than untangling it. "Every move is a choice, and every choice has consequences" pays off when Alaric chooses acceptance over continued guilt. The final image of him anticipating new pupils while "the world was vast" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled imagery ("fierce repose," "woven hush"). The brief dialogue between young Alaric and the prince feels natural and advances the guilt that drives the story. Some filter phrases ("Alaric knew," "He saw") could be stronger, but overall the prose texture supports the contemplative tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("threads pulsed like living veins," "soft as a whisper") and occasional redundancy ("eerie stillness," then "silence pressed in"). The "fidgeted productively" phrase feels forced. Information density is good with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The tapestry-as-memory-decoder offers a fresh angle on the curse-breaking template, with colored threads representing specific emotions. The synthesis of chess strategy ("every move is a choice") with weaving metaphors creates coherent originality. The time-frozen village is somewhat familiar, but the specific execution through self-forgiveness rather than external quest elevates it.</comment>
