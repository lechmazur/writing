<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's uncertainty and alchemical incompetence drive genuine internal conflict through embodied details like trembling hands and the burned breath. The progression from self-doubt to acceptance of imperfection ("Kintsugi isn't about perfection. It's about *surviving*") is earned through concrete struggle with the charm and statue, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic label-speak ("Redemption? Answers?").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates as Accumulative/Textural, building through layered memories and the charm-statue interaction toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira accepts brokenness as strength. The closure lands with felt cost ("letting the fumes burn her lungs") and conceptual repricing of the charm as promise rather than key. Minor orientation delays and some causality softness in the middle prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The acid sea functions as both setting and pressure device, constraining choices through its corrosive threat and the respirator's removal. Vivid sensory details ("neon-green acid," "fumes eating the air like a thief") and the workshop's mechanical heartbeat create atmosphere while the statue's pockmarks and charm's grooves provide tactile specificity that drives the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from uncertainty about the charm's purpose through memories surfacing to the final choice to remove the respirator and embrace the acid's burn. The progression from "adjusting her respirator" to deliberately removing it shows agency foreclosing safety with visible cost, though middle beats could tighten the pressure more decisively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The kintsugi metaphor organically emerges through action (charm matching scars, memories as quilted fragments) rather than declaration, culminating in the insight that "The kintsugi isn't in the gold... It's in the *choice* to mend." The final reframing of survival over perfection resonantly answers the central question without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice through alchemical lexicon ("vials of liquid light, vials of shattered starlight") and controlled rhythm that accelerates during pressure moments. The statue's sudden speech feels slightly unmotivated, but overall POV consistency and perceptual signature (seeing patterns in quilts, acid, father's hands) maintain coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The acid sea lapped at the workshop's copper hull, its fumes eating the air like a thief") but some paraphrase loops ("Between breaths" repeated three times) and filter-verb clusters ("She'd seen," "she felt," "she saw"). Information density is good but occasional redundancy ("time blurred by the acid's stench and the statue's silent judgment") prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The fusion of alchemy, kintsugi philosophy, and acid-sea dystopia creates a fresh synthesis, particularly in making the charm a promise rather than solution. The specific detail of finding it "in the statue's hollow chest, nestled beside a skeleton's ribcage" and the mother's quilts from "scraps of old uniforms" elevate beyond template, though some emotional beats feel familiar.</comment>
