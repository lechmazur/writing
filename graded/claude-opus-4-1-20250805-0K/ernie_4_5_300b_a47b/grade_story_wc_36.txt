<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to "harvest insights from failure" drives concrete actions and internal conflict, particularly in the chamber scene where he confronts past selves. The emotional progression from trembling fingers to roaring defiance to quiet acceptance shows believable psychological movement. However, the mentor's cryptic riddle ("unmake your failures") feels slightly forced, and Kael's specific failures (plague, theft) arrive as summary rather than embodied memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Kael's shift from seeking answers in echoes to understanding silence's power, with visible cost in the broken flute. Causal linkage holds: playing the flute → chamber opens → confrontation with past failures → breaking the flute → learning its true nature. The orientation anchors (Thunder-Echo Range, relic keeper, three moons since mentor's death) establish context within the first 120 words. Closure lands with the new rune for "surrender" paying off the earlier driftwood markers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Thunder-Echo Range functions as more than backdrop—its labyrinthine structure necessitates the driftwood markers, and the chamber's obsidian staircase creates spatial pressure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "bruised sky," "petrified pine and ozone," "time pooled like liquid." The driftwood markers constrain navigation choices and return transformed in the ending with the new surrender rune.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mastering the flute's true purpose—escalates from playing a melody to confronting past failures to accepting the lesson of unmaking. The broken flute represents genuine loss that forecloses the path of seeking answers through sound. However, the mentor's appearance feels slightly convenient, and the resolution through breaking arrives somewhat abruptly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the flute as "door not mirror" reframes Kael's relationship to failure from something to harvest to something to unmake. The final image of etching a surrender rune resonates without stating a moral, reweighting the earlier directional markers. The story resists tidy resolution—Kael walks home with fragments, not wholeness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception ("gilded reed flute from its oilskin wrapper") and character-specific diction. The phrase "avalanchingly quiet" demonstrates purposeful compression that pays off thematically. Dialogue between Kael and the specter carries subtext about teaching methods. Minor issue: "avalanchingly quiet" appears twice with identical phrasing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("needle through silk," "time pooled like liquid") but suffers from occasional overwriting. The phrase "avalanchingly quiet" repeats verbatim. Some metaphors strain: moths with wings "scattering ash" feels slightly forced. Information density is generally good, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of a flute whose power lies in silence rather than sound offers a fresh angle on the magical instrument trope. The driftwood navigation system and the chamber where "time pooled like liquid" show specific world-building. However, the mentor-as-ghost teaching through riddles is familiar territory, preventing higher originality scores.</comment>
