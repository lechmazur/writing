<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael's patient methodology and "reactively visionary" approach create consistent motivation, though her interiority remains somewhat abstract rather than embodied. The fisherman and girl provide functional pressure but lack depth. The final choice to display the trumpet shows earned resolution through accumulated fragments, though emotional stakes could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through "staggered intervals" that build toward the trumpet's restoration as Resonant Reconfiguration. Each site visit adds a fragment that reweights the harbor's fractured history, with the final museum display carrying social/communal cost. However, the pattern feels mechanical—three sites, predictable discoveries—rather than organically pressured.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ivory harbor's rain-slicked surfaces and specific locations (lighthouse cottage, eastern quay, central plaza) anchor the narrative spatially. Sensory details like "salt-sting of absence" and "rough as barnacles" voice add texture. Yet setting rarely constrains choices—Lirael could perform her method anywhere—missing the higher band requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake of "compiling fragments into meaning" progresses through accumulation rather than escalation. Each site deepens understanding without raising cost until the final restoration. The method creates its own gentle pressure through patience, though stakes remain abstract—historical completion rather than visceral consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The trumpet valve as "promise" and "bridge between eras" resonates through concrete discoveries rather than assertion. The theme of fractured histories mended through patience emerges from events, particularly the herald's hidden trumpet symbolizing silenced voices. The ending's "symphony waiting to be played" metaphor feels slightly overwrought but lands the reconciliation theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent distance with Lirael's scholarly perspective coloring observations ("ocean-spray archivist" idiom). Dialogue from fisherman and girl carries authentic roughness and youth respectively. However, the narrative voice tends toward expository summary ("Her method was staggered intervals...") rather than immediate scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose flows clearly but suffers from repetitive structure ("Her first stop...Next, she ventured...Her final site") and abstract phrasing ("navigating those absences"). The "mosaic/symphony" metaphors in the closing paragraph feel forced. Information density is moderate—many sentences restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "staggered intervals" methodology offers a patient twist on archaeological discovery, and using a trumpet valve as memory beacon shows specificity. However, the three-site structure feels templated, and the resolution—museum display of restored trumpet—lands predictably. The concept of objects triggering memory isn't particularly fresh.</comment>
