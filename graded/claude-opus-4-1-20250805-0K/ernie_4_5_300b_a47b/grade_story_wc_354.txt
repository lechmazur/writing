<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alaric's chess-teaching heresy and exile create clear motivation that drives his covenant quest. His internal contradiction between scholarly precision and mystical pursuit plays out through concrete actions (kneeling, tracing the stone, inserting the key). The memory of Lira provides embodied backstory that directly shapes his interpretation of the covenant's "beauty in constraints." Minor deduction for the star-mage's appearance feeling slightly convenient despite setup.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silence gradually translates through stone, memory, and revelation, building to the star-seed planting that reconfigures the covenant from document to living thing. The closure lands with conceptual cost (exile validated through lonely discovery) and visible transformation (sprouting sapling). Deduction for the keyhole/key revelation feeling mechanically convenient despite thematic resonance, and for slight ambiguity in how the hologram projection works.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus functions as active setting—warping compasses, humming with vibration, enabling the stone's transformation. Sensory details (teeth aching from vibration, violet twilight, moss-crusted monolith) are selective and support the mystical atmosphere. The sapling with "leaves like fractured mirrors" provides a strong final image. Modest deduction for the star-mage's translucent appearance lacking more specific visual anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to cosmic covenant renewal through accumulative pressure—stone's glow, hologram appearance, keyhole revelation. The dominant stake (correlating stone with covenant before eclipse) tightens through each discovery. Cost is visible in Alaric's tears and isolation. Deduction for the convenient brass key from Lira and the star-mage's validation feeling slightly unearned despite groundwork.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of "beauty in constraints" emerges organically through chess metaphor (queen's diagonal movement), the covenant's subtle fulfillment, and the final image of fractured-mirror leaves. The stone's silence speaking and Alaric's translation work avoid explicit moralizing. Strong subtext in the chess lessons informing cosmic understanding. Minor deduction for "beauty in the difficult" being slightly over-articulated in dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains scholarly precision filtered through mystical experience ("Thoughtfully precise," "silence that speaks in stones"). Free indirect style works well in the memory sequence. The star-mage's omnidirectional voice creates appropriate otherworldliness. Deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't fully match Alaric's established lexicon ("celestial alignment that would eclipse the sun and moon simultaneously").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose generally clean with purposeful rhythm variations and strong opening/closing images. Information density good in descriptive passages. Some template cadence in middle section ("Alaric closed his eyes... He pressed his palm...") and minor filter verb clustering. The "hopeful melancholy" in the final line feels slightly forced rather than emergent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess mastery with cosmic mysticism creates original angle on mentor-exile trope. The covenant as living encoded thing rather than document shows creative thinking. The specific detail of melted chess pieces forming the key and the fractured-mirror leaves demonstrate imaginative particularity. Slight deduction for star-mage revelation following familiar mystical validation patterns.</comment>
