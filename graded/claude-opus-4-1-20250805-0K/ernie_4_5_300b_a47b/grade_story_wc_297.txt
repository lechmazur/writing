<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation to reweave the covenant is clear and drives choices, with embodied details like scars tingling and burning. The golden-eyed double creates genuine internal conflict about surrendering humanity. However, the final transformation lacks sufficient embodied cost—scars vanishing into "glowing lines" feels unearned given the setup's emphasis on pain acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lirael accepts that "the intersection of dreams wasn't a place—it was a choice," with scars transformed. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density shifts and pattern breaks. Cost remains somewhat abstract—"surrendering humanity" is declared but the actual price of the transformation isn't viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt glade and Glass Labyrinth create vivid, purposeful settings that constrain choices—the labyrinth's "condensed time" and "whispers of futures" directly shape Lirael's navigation. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (ozone taste, fireflies as fractured stars). The maze topiary clipping functions as micro-setting that enables the scar-link method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from finding the intersection to confronting what that choice means—accepting pain of both worlds. The golden-eyed double forces the key decision about humanity versus covenant repair. However, the resolution arrives too easily; pressing the clipping to her heart instantly resolves the fractured covenant without dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of scars as both wounds and maps, with the intersection being internal choice rather than external place. The double's insight about hesitation versus heeding adds complexity. The final image of two moons elegantly visualizes the merged worlds, though the ease of resolution slightly undercuts thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled metaphorical density ("time pooled like spilled ink"). POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature—Lirael notices through touch and physical sensation. Dialogue between Lirael and her double carries subtext about fear and acceptance, advancing the internal conflict naturally.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful imagery. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some metaphorical density in early paragraphs ("cobalt glade," "root-bound visionary," "eclipsed covenant") risks overwhelming, but the language serves the accumulative texture rather than obscuring meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of navigating between dreaming and waking worlds through physical scars offers fresh specificity. The golden-eyed double as same-self-different-choice creates non-obvious internal conflict. The transformation of a vanished labyrinth into a choice about accepting dual-world pain shows genuine conceptual sophistication beyond surface fantasy tropes.</comment>
