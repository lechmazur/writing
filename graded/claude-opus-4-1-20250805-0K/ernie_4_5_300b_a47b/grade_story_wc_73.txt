I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This story operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens, building density through the repetition and transformation of the dice, mathematical proofs, and the staircase's paradoxical geometry until the final image of perpetual motion crystallizes meaning.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's characterization as a "grim optimist" manifests through concrete actions—calculating odds at 42.7%, testing theories by hurling dice into the void, seeking perpetual motion to "hold the shape" of loss. The internal contradiction between his methodical approach and the impossibility of his quest creates genuine tension, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("the texture of that loss").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: Kael creates perpetual motion in the dice's endless orbit, transforming his relationship to loss from possession to witnessing. The cost is legible—he cannot touch what he's created, accepting distance as the price of understanding. The accumulative lens holds as mathematical proofs, dice throws, and ruptures build toward this crystallized moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The infinite staircase functions as both setting and constraint, its Möbius-strip logic forcing Kael's experimental approach. Specific details like "stone that shimmered like aged parchment" and "air tasted of ozone and regret" create atmosphere while the staircase's breathing, rearranging nature actively shapes his tactics and enables the final perpetual motion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing the texture of loss through perpetual motion—deepens through accumulation: dice tests, mathematical proofs, and the rupture experiment. The escalation follows the accumulative lens as density increases toward the climactic rupture that creates the orbital dance, though the middle section could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the dice's orbit—"the space between the dice, the tension of their endless dance"—offering a non-literal answer about loss and memory. The story resists moralizing, letting the image of unreachable perpetual motion embody the paradox of holding absence, with the chipped die's flaw "gleaming like a star" as final resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with controlled, mathematical precision ("counted each rise and fall as if the numbers might unlock something") that suits Kael's character. The prose modulates effectively under pressure, shifting from analytical to visceral ("slammed his fist into the stone"), though occasional abstractions like "infinite made of silence" slightly blur specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in action sequences. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor issues include occasional abstraction ("texture of that loss" appears twice) and slight overwriting in metaphorical passages, but the closing image lands with clarity and power.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of mathematical proof, grief, and impossible geometry creates genuine originality. The specific detail of 42.7% odds and the chipped die's childhood origin elevate beyond template loss narratives. The final image of perpetual motion as untouchable orbit offers a fresh metaphor for memory's persistence.</comment>
