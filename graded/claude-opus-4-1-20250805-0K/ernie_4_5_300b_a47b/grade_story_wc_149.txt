<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ghost bride's motivation is layered and specific—betrayal, curse, eternal binding—with contradictory impulses of grief and gratitude acting simultaneously. The final choice to free both herself and her betrayer carries visible cost through centuries of suffering. Deduction for some expository interiority in the middle section that tells rather than embodies the emotional state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost dissolves into freedom after Elara's understanding breaks the curse, with visible cost in "centuries" of imprisonment. The accumulative/textural lens holds through fruit-messages building to awakening. Minor deduction for slightly rushed resolution that could have dwelt more on the cost of freedom.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as both prison and sanctuary, with crystalline fruits that "hummed with latent magic" constraining choices throughout. The stone bead serves as micro-setting that enables the final transformation. Strong sensory work with "frost clung to glass panes" and "shadows pooled like ink."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from mysterious fruit-gifts to "resonant awakenings" when Elara places bead against fruit, forcing the ghost's revelation. The debt-repayment motivation creates coherent pressure. Deduction for relatively passive protagonist (Elara) who mostly receives rather than pursues until the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "loving and venomous," showing how debt transcends simple love/hate binaries. The final image of "mournful elation" resonates as freedom that required centuries of suffering. Minor deduction for slight thematic echo in "debt is paid not in blood, but in understanding."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive Gothic register with "ashen-veil," "spectral iridescence," maintaining lyric consistency. The ghost's voice as "rustle of dead leaves" fits perfectly. Deduction for occasional register elevation ("latent magic," "ephemeral cameo") that slightly exceeds the POV's established texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric prose with varied sentence structure and vivid imagery. Information density high in opening paragraph. Deductions for synonym loops ("centuries"/"centuries ago"), some filter constructions ("believed the gifts to be"), and occasional overwriting in metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost bride and alchemical greenhouse creates non-obvious premise. The twist that the betrayer became the stone bead adds originality. The debt-as-understanding resolution avoids cliché revenge. Slight deduction for somewhat familiar Gothic atmosphere.</comment>
