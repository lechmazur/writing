I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and cadence shifts rather than strict causality, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Zara's motivation—finding strength in vulnerability through empathizing with falling stars—drives consistent choices from observation deck to crater. Her internal contradiction between scientific duty and spiritual seeking manifests in embodied actions (walking with "primal elegance," kneeling at the crater). The final choice to preserve stardust shows earned wisdom through concrete experience, though Veyra's transformation feels slightly unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the stardust preserved in glass—a physical proof that transforms both characters' understanding of worth. The accumulative structure builds from stillness-tending through star-tracking to the crater journey, with cost visible in Zara's decades of marginalization. However, Veyra's sudden softening lacks sufficient groundwork, and the thematic echo "I just listened" edges toward explicit moralizing (-0.4).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The station's decaying domes and control room anchor the setting immediately, while the yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting that constrains Zara's journey and charges the final image. Sensory details filter through Zara's spiritual perspective ("stars burned so close you could almost touch their light"). The obsidian shards and creature bones on the plateau create tactile navigation that affects her careful movement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—validating spiritual observation over mechanical tracking—escalates through Zara's decision to follow the fractured star despite Veyra's dismissal. The journey to the crater and kneeling beside dying starlight shows agency through attention. However, the conflict lacks a meaningful tightening that would force trade-offs; Zara's choice costs her little beyond time, limiting the pressure that drives transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between mechanical observation and spiritual listening, embodied in contrasting approaches to the same cosmic phenomena. The stardust captured in yellow glass offers a non-literal answer about finding meaning in ephemeral moments. Subtext operates effectively through Veyra's softening stance, though the line "I just listened" veers toward explicit theme statement (-0.4).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm ("when the sky hung low and the stars burned so close"). Zara's perceptual signature filters cosmic events through spiritual metaphor ("tears from the heavens"). Dialogue between Zara and Veyra carries naturalistic tension, though limited exchanges prevent full voice distinction. Some elevated diction ("primal elegance") occasionally drifts from Zara's janitor perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of beauty ("shooting stars streaked like tears from the heavens") but suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing around "stillness" and "hush" that becomes loop-like. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She believed... She carried... She reached"). Information density varies; some passages advance atmosphere without plot momentum. The final paragraph's explicit theme summary dulls impact (-0.5).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor who finds spiritual meaning in stellar dissolution offers a fresh angle on both occupational fiction and cosmic observation stories. The synthesis of menial labor with profound cosmic connection feels specific. However, the wisdom-through-observation arc follows familiar patterns, and Veyra's transformation lacks the groundwork that would make it feel inevitable rather than convenient.</comment>
