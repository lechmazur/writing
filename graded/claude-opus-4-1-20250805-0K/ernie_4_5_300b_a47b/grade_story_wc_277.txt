<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is clear and rooted in family legacy, with concrete internal conflict between loyalty and truth-seeking. The "devotedly observant" trait manifests through specific actions (mapping stars as escape, cross-referencing documents). However, the emotional progression feels compressed—the shift from shock to activism happens too quickly without sufficient embodied struggle, and some interiority relies on abstract declarations ("Orbits of regret still spun, but she'd learned to dance in their gravity").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves closure through Decisive Change—Clara exposes corruption and transforms from passive heiress to active reformer, with visible costs (family relationships, public criticism). The causal chain from discovery to action is clear. However, the temporal scope strains credibility (observatory scene to Congressional testimony), and the ending's metaphorical declaration weakens the otherwise concrete cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The observatory setting provides both atmosphere and functional constraint (records storage, isolation for decision-making). Sensory details like "gears grinding like a celestial heartbeat" and the lamp casting shadows are effective. However, the setting becomes generic after the initial paragraphs, and the rosewood elements feel more ornamental than essential to choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (family legacy vs. truth) is clear with escalation from suspicion through discovery to public exposure. Clara's agency drives the investigation and decision to publish. The cost is visible (family fracture, public backlash), though the compressed timeline and convenient evidence discovery ("Pay off the inspector" note) reduce tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "orbits of regret" theme emerges through action—past corruption circling back for reckoning. The observatory/astronomy metaphors connect to themes of seeing truth and perspective. However, Clara's explicit thematic statements ("My family's orbit isn't one of light—it's a black hole") and the final paragraph's abstract moralizing undercut subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited with clear focalization through Clara. Dialogue distinguishes characters effectively (journalist's urgency vs. mother's emotion). However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with urgency ("orbits of regret," "dance in their gravity"), and some interiority feels explanatory rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose clarity is generally strong with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, multiple abstract metaphors cluster without advancing action ("black hole, swallowing truths," "dance in their gravity"), and there's register drift into philosophical abstraction that slows momentum. The final paragraph especially suffers from conceptual redundancy about truth as "compass."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The corruption-in-philanthropy angle offers a solid premise, and Clara's use of her grandfather's observatory to expose her father's crimes has thematic resonance. However, the execution relies on familiar tropes (shocking document discovery, crusading heiress) without sufficient transformation, and the convenient evidence discovery feels templated.</comment>
