<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael's backwards-walking habit and mirror-shard avoidance create a distinctive character with clear internal logic. The young woman's arrival provides adequate pressure, though her desperation could be more viscerally embodied. The final choice to "walk backwards" literalizes the metaphor effectively, earning the closure through established causality with visible cost (confronting avoided trauma).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through layered imagery (shadow in glass, tea leaves, backwards walking) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the woman accepts the cost of reversing her village's exile. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. The closure lands with conceptual cost ("confront what you've avoided"), though the specific price could be more visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The forgotten library with ivy-draped walls and creaking playground swing establishes atmosphere effectively. The "shadow caught in glass" creating a jagged map pattern provides a recurring visual motif that charges the final image. However, the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain choices—the consultation could occur anywhere with minor adjustments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reversing the village's exile/death) is signaled clearly when the woman arrives. Pressure tightens once as Lirael moves from passive archiving to active mentoring, though the escalation feels modest. The cost remains somewhat abstract ("confront what you've avoided") rather than showing specific trade-offs or losses.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of "reversible exile" emerges through concrete imagery and action rather than assertion. The tea-leaf divination and backwards-walking literalize abstract concepts effectively. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the shadow/light metaphor, though the resolution edges toward explicit statement ("the quietest lessons were the loudest").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent POV with distinctive perceptual signatures (backwards walking, tea-leaf geometry, shadow patterns). Dialogue between Lirael and the woman feels natural with appropriate subtext. Some filter-verb clustering ("she felt a restlessness") slightly dulls immediacy but doesn't compromise closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Some elevated diction ("reversible exile," "mentor resilience quietly") occasionally drifts from natural speech patterns. Minor redundancy in explaining the backwards-walking metaphor, but information density remains solid overall with lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The backwards-walking trait and tea-leaf divination offer fresh angles on familiar mentor-student dynamics. The "reversible exile" concept provides conceptual originality, though the dying village setup is conventional. The synthesis of physical reversal with emotional confrontation shows genuine insight.</comment>
