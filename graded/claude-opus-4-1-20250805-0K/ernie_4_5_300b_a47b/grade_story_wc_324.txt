I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This story operates under a **Causal lens** - Lila's investigation follows because/therefore linkages as she traces the photograph to the hearing aid to the spectral encounter to the final delivery of the message.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lila's motivation as a "midwife to grief" is clear and her persistent curiosity drives the investigation convincingly. The emotional progression from professional duty to personal investment works, though the man's spectral appearance and message delivery feel somewhat convenient. Internal conflict between professional distance and emotional involvement could be stronger.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The causal chain holds (photo → hearing aid → pulse → message → delivery) but the closure lacks sufficient visible cost - Lila completes her task without meaningful sacrifice or transformation. The "incidental heroism" concept is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choice. Orientation is clear by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The atrium setting with its "bruised violet" light and abandoned galleries creates effective atmosphere that supports the liminal space between life and death. The hearing aid as micro-setting constrains and enables the key discovery. Spatial choreography through the labyrinth is coherent and the mist functions as both atmosphere and threshold marker.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (delivering the unspoken message) is clear but escalation is minimal - Lila faces no real opposition or difficult trade-offs. The "pulse" discovery provides mild tightening but there's no moment where she must sacrifice or risk something meaningful. Cost remains abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of love transcending death emerges through the specific image of synchronized hearing aids creating a "duet of the living and dead." The ending offers resonance without explicit moralizing, though "Sometimes love is too big for words" edges toward statement. The photograph's transformation from clue to vessel of meaning works well.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent third-person limited with appropriate psychic distance. Lila's perceptual signature shows in details like "mist curling around her ankles like spectral cats." Dialogue between Lila and the widow feels natural with appropriate subtext, though the spectral man's "Assure her I loved her" is somewhat generic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and good momentum. Strong images like "bruised violet" twilight and "heartbeat trapped in amber" elevate key moments. Some phrases edge toward overwriting ("midwife to grief," "frozen promises") but don't overwhelm. Information density is solid with most sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept of tracing "hearts" as echoes of unspoken truths offers a fresh angle on supernatural communication, but execution relies on familiar ghost-story beats. The synchronized hearing aids provide a specific mechanism, though the resolution feels safe. The story doesn't take significant risks or transform the genre substantially.</comment>
