<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation to negotiate with her ghost through collected fragments is clear and consistent, with embodied exhaustion ("I'm tired") and visible renunciation at closure. However, the ghost's nature as "her younger self" creates some confusion about whether this is internal conflict or external haunting, and emotional transitions (particularly the unexplained smile) lack sufficient grounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Veyra collecting fragments leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration when she releases the camera wheel and accepts rest. The rose transformation and her departure create visible change with implied cost (drowning/transcendence ambiguity). However, the ghost's exact nature remains unclear, and the mechanics of how dropping the camera wheel leads to transformation lack causal clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon's rhythms ("sloshed westward at dawn," "hissed when the wind carried secrets") and the dormant carousel create atmospheric pressure that shapes Veyra's scavenging patterns. The bruised violet/electric gold waters and the camera wheel as micro-setting constrain her final choice. The fantastical setting maintains consistency though some details (the rose's appearance) strain physical logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Veyra's need to negotiate with her ghost about forgiveness—escalates through the camera wheel discovery to the confrontation where she drops it into the lagoon. The ghost's challenge ("where's the courage to let go?") forces her choice with visible cost in her departure/dissolution. However, the pressure could be more acute, and the transformation mechanism remains opaque.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of temporal confusion and inability to let go emerges through the lagoon's fractured time, the stopped carousel, and Veyra's collection of fragments. The ghost's revelation about self-forgiveness and the final ambiguity (drowned/transcended) avoid tidy resolution. The rose as final image reweights the collection motif, though the transformation from camera wheel to rose lacks grounded logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent melancholic lyricism with selective perception focused on decay and fragments. Dialogue between Veyra and the ghost carries subtext about self-blame effectively ("You cling to fragments. The lagoon doesn't care"). Some phrases feel overwritten ("bruised violet," "electric gold") but the voice coheres around the POV's exhausted persistence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("her calloused fingers sifting through the froth") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing too frequently in descriptive passages. Some metaphors strain ("the sun hung like a stuck coin"). The final section maintains better momentum though "Some said she'd drowned. Others insisted she'd finally outrun time" feels templated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of a scavenger negotiating with her own ghost through collected debris offers fresh angle on grief and self-forgiveness. The kinetic lagoon above clouds with temporal distortion creates memorable setting. However, the ghost-as-younger-self device and the ambiguous transcendence ending echo familiar patterns without sufficient transformation.</comment>
