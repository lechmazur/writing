<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The storyteller's motivation is clear and consistent—translating extinct languages through resonance—and her final renunciation ("I am the extinction!") carries visible cost as she sacrifices the diamond. Internal conflict between fear of oblivion and dedication to preservation acts simultaneously in the climactic scene. The "quietly articulate voice narrating chaos into order" shows specific embodiment, though some interiority relies on abstract concepts rather than concrete perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through bird observations culminating in resonant reconfiguration when the storyteller hurls the diamond away, accepting her role as extinction itself. The cost is visible—losing the diamond that held "the key to something deeper"—and the closure reweights her relationship to oblivion. Orientation anchors (canyon edge, towers of bone, twin moons) establish setting immediately.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The canyon of echoes and bone towers constrain choices—she must position herself on the narrow ledge for the birds' migration, and the echoes themselves become the medium for translation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "shadows streaked across the bone towers like ink spilled on parchment." The environment actively participates in the climax as the towers vibrate and glow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest (translating languages) to existential confrontation with oblivion, with the diamond's curse revealed as a mirror of deepest fears. The birds' arrival triggers the climactic test, and the canyon's roaring echoes force her decisive action. Cost is legible when she sacrifices the diamond, though the middle section could tighten pressure between observation and climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of preserving what is already lost—the storyteller becomes "the extinction" to transcend her fear of it. The diamond-as-mirror concept reweights the curse from malevolence to self-reflection. The final line "some languages are meant to be felt, not spoken" resonates without moralizing, though the fear-as-weapon revelation edges toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with copper-veined skin and synesthetic perception ("translate texture into sound"). Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm: "The canyon itself was a throat of endless echoes." The POV remains stable with appropriate narrative certainty, though peak moments occasionally drift toward elevated register ("a geometry of vibrations") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence structure and selective detail, with strong moments like "towers of bone rose like skeletal fingers." Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("sound was not music—it was mathematics") and occasional register elevation, but clarity remains intact. Information density is generally high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of translating texture into sound through a cursed diamond's resonance offers fresh synthesis, particularly the revelation that the curse mirrors the listener's deepest fear. The storyteller as preserver-become-extinction provides non-obvious resolution. Specific details like "copper-veined" skin and recording bird patterns in leather journals create particularity beyond template fantasy.</comment>
