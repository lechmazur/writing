I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and reflection toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than strict causal progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lila's internal state of "changed" numbness replacing grief is embodied through concrete actions—clutching the parasol tip, volunteering for grueling work to "dull the ache." The rescue sequence shows contradictory impulses (came for death, acts to save) playing out in scene. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("fold in patience") that isn't fully dramatized until later.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lila's shift from seeking "final tranquility" to finding "a flicker of something like peace" after the rescue. The orientation is clear early, and the accumulative structure builds through ice/cold imagery toward this earned moment. Deduction for the somewhat convenient timing of finding the trapped woman, though the emotional cost of Lila's journey remains legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina functions as both literal setting and emotional landscape—"a place where the world seemed to grip reality loosely." Sensory details (fogging breath, ice-encrusted boats, keening sound through ice) create atmosphere while the frozen environment constrains choices and enables the rescue. The parasol tip becomes essential tool rather than ornament.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Lila's journey between death-seeking and life-saving—develops through accumulative pressure. The rescue provides meaningful deepening as she acts "when the moment called" despite coming for opposite reasons. The cost is primarily internal/emotional rather than external, appropriate for this textural approach but lacking the visceral edge of higher scores.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the "fold in patience"—that space between action and acceptance where "exhaustion softened into surrender." The rescue doesn't resolve this ambiguity but reweights it: both women were "looking for something." The final peace isn't tidy resolution but earned complexity, with the parasol tip bridging grandmother's legacy to present action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary distance with selective perception ("skeletal network of docks") that reflects Lila's detached state. The prose modulates effectively—tightening during the rescue, expanding in reflection. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("We all are"). Minor deduction for occasional overwriting ("mournful wail that seemed to emanate from the ice itself").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple purposes. Deductions for scattered overwriting ("keening sound, like wind through a cracked bell"), some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete, and occasional redundancy ("pale and shivering" followed immediately by "shivering").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story transforms the euthanasia tourism premise through the volunteer work frame and the unexpected rescue. The "fold in patience" concept offers a fresh angle on grief and acceptance. However, the rescue-changes-perspective arc is somewhat familiar, and the transformation doesn't fully escape recognizable patterns despite specific details.</comment>
