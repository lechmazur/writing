I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as the piece builds density through layered imagery (amber pendant, moss garden, drip patterns) toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lila accepts grafting as healing.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lila's internal contradiction between hiding and connecting drives authentic choices, particularly when she unclasps the pendant containing the accident's obsidian shard. The moment "I've been afraid to lose him twice" embodies genuine vulnerability. Minor deduction for Elias reading slightly functional as wisdom-dispenser rather than fully contradictory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the grafting metaphor realized in action—planting the sapling together with "hands brushing in the soil." Cost is visible in Lila's acceptance that "grafting isn't permanent. It's a conversation." Deduction for slightly mechanical setup of the viral confession backstory that doesn't fully integrate with present pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned data center transformed into moss garden constrains choices effectively—the drip pattern becomes art, server racks anchor the space. "The garden's silence wasn't emptiness but a container—protected vulnerability" charges the final image. Setting actively shapes emotional terrain and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative density: pendant revelation → moss grafting → sapling planting. The stake of processing grief through transformation deepens when Elias suggests "expanding his story" rather than losing it. Cost becomes tangible in accepting impermanence: "It'll outgrow this place someday."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the grafting metaphor without stating morals. "Healing wasn't about erasing the past but letting it breathe" resonates through concrete action. The final image of snow falling outside while "the garden held its heat" offers non-literal resolution to the vulnerability/protection tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent interiority with selective perception ("honeyed hush," "skeletal remains of servers"). Dialogue carries authentic subtext—"They're anchors...Without them, the place would float away." Minor deduction for occasional filter verbs ("she realized," "she wondered") that slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong density: "The garden's heart was a chamber where rusted server racks cradled terrariums of bioluminescent moss." Some repetitive structures appear ("She'd spent years," "She'd noticed," "She'd been afraid") creating mild template cadence. Information density generally strong but occasional scaffolding phrases reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of data center and moss garden offers fresh specificity—technology becoming organic sanctuary. The drip pattern transformed into deliberate art provides non-obvious detail. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without forcing dramatic confrontation.</comment>
