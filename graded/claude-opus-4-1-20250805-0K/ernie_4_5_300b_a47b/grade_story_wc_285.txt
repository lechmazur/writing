<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Thaddeus has clear traits (closely attentive, distilling complexity) but his motivation lacks urgency—the crossing feels routine rather than pressured. The yarn needle as a metaphor for his gift works conceptually but doesn't generate concrete conflict or choice. No meaningful change occurs; he simply completes another crossing while reflecting on his role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Earned Stasis (Thaddeus continues his role) but lacks visible cost—the "palimpsest promise" remains abstract without testing his commitment. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but accumulation doesn't build toward pressure or reweight the stakes. Orientation is clear but the absence of meaningful escalation or cost at closure limits the score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fog, river, and ferry create atmospheric coherence with strong sensory detail ("fog rolled in like a second skin"). The setting functions as more than backdrop—the river serves as a space for clarity and the fog creates appropriate isolation. However, the environment doesn't constrain choices or generate pressure that affects the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation occurs—Thaddeus waits, boards, crosses, and disembarks without encountering resistance or making difficult choices. The "palimpsest promise" suggests layered vows but never manifests as concrete pressure. The rain gutters' ticking provides temporal boundary but doesn't tighten options or force trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The distilling complexity theme emerges through the yarn needle metaphor and Thaddeus's contemplative stance, avoiding direct statement. However, the theme doesn't develop through conflict or choice—it remains static observation. The palimpsest metaphor of layered meaning has potential but lacks dramatic testing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with contemplative, literary register appropriate to Thaddeus's philosophical nature. Perceptual signature shows in his attention to vibrations, rhythms, and ambient details. Some repetitive phrasing ("closely attentive" appears verbatim twice) and the absence of dialogue limits voice demonstration under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from conceptual redundancy—multiple paragraphs restate the distilling/unraveling metaphor without advancement. Template phrasing appears ("He'd always been closely attentive," "Back then, he'd thought"). The yarn needle metaphor gets explained rather than dramatized, creating tell-heavy passages that slow momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The palimpsest river crossing offers a fresh metaphorical frame, and the yarn needle as truth-seeking tool shows originality. However, execution remains abstract—the philosophical meditation doesn't transform through specific dramatic pressure. The piece reads more as extended metaphor than story with stakes.</comment>
