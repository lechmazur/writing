<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's obsession with silence drives concrete actions throughout, from tracing mortar cracks to creating the map by "summarizing silences." Her internal contradiction between fear and determination manifests in trembling lips while smiling at completion. The cost—walking "the edge of oblivion"—is acknowledged but the final choice to return to the shore feels slightly underdeveloped in its stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern intensification through layered silences building to the map's completion. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the map transforms from physical guide to temporal/existential one, with clear cost in the fort's darkness and Mara's acceptance of oblivion's edge. The "who/where/when" anchors establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The storm-tossed fort constrains action (crouching in lee of archway) and provides materials (mortar cracks as language). Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's oracle nature—prioritizing texture, sound absence, and light over conventional details. The gold flakes becoming "stolen starlight" on her hands transforms setting into embodied consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation follows accumulative logic as each silence type deepens the map's complexity—from wave-pause to thunderclap-hush to breath-held stillness. The dominant stake (completing the map before the last star vanishes) creates genuine time pressure. Cost manifests in aching fingers, the fort's darkness, and accepting navigation by absence rather than light.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of silence as "both absence and presence," reaching resonant payoff when Mara succeeds "not by capturing light but by summarizing its absence." The map's transformation from physical to temporal guide ("moments: the silence before a decision") offers non-literal answer to navigating endless night.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature filters everything through sound's absence and tactile sensation ("fingers tracing," "air hummed," "silence so thick it seemed to pulse"). Rhythm modulates effectively from contemplative opening to urgent sketching to peaceful acceptance. Minor voice drift occurs with "palimpsest of echoes" feeling slightly academic for the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The fort's walls groaned, as if annoyed by her intrusion" conveys both setting decay and narrative pressure. Some figurative density in peak moments ("marbled hush," "palimpsest of echoes") but serves the accumulative pattern. Clean propulsion with varied sentence structures maintaining momentum throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of mapping silence by summarizing its varieties offers genuine freshness, transforming the expected oracle-prophecy trope. Risk-taking in the lyrical approach to an essentially abstract action pays off through concrete embodiment. The specificity of "ink made from crushed seashells" and gold flakes as "slow-motion snow" prevents abstraction.</comment>
