<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in family legacy, with embodied stress ("legs burned, vision blurring") and concrete internal conflict between logic and emotional resonance. The ghost confrontation forces meaningful choice with visible cost, though some interiority relies on abstractions like "logically emotional" without fully dramatizing the contradiction in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore linkage: key's distress summons ghost → Elias uses resonator → frequencies harmonize → ghost accepts bridge concept. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with Elias accepting his role as "guardian of frequencies," though the cost could be more visceral beyond exhaustion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setting anchors early with vivid sensory detail ("azure-coat," "frosted planks," "tangerine and lavender" horizon) and the lighthouse/marina environment shapes choices through the key's location and ice vibrations. However, the setting doesn't fully constrain the climactic choice—the confrontation could occur elsewhere with minor adjustments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from protecting the key to confronting the ghost to understanding harmony as solution, with one meaningful reversal when sonic attack becomes sonic bridge. Cost appears through physical exhaustion and the weight of ongoing vigilance, though the ghost's capitulation feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the harmony/frequency metaphor, avoiding direct moralizing while exploring balance between logic and emotion, physical and spectral. The final image of Elias as bridge-builder resonates without stating its meaning, and "some battles are won not with force, but with harmony" crystallizes earned wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical register appropriate to an engineer-protagonist with controlled modulation during stress. Dialogue between Elias and ghost carries subtext about understanding versus conflict, though some phrases like "logically emotional" and "sonic absolution" feel artificially inserted rather than voice-organic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose shows competent rhythm variation and sensory specificity, but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("Elias's breath," "Elias knelt," "Elias smiled") and some overwriting in metaphorical density ("bleeding" horizon, "azure-coat" repeated). Template cadence appears in action sequences and abstract concepts like "logically emotional" lack concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The sonic resonator as ghost-communication device offers a fresh angle on spectral confrontation, and the harmony-over-force resolution subverts expected conflict patterns. However, the lighthouse keeper's descendant protecting ancestral artifact follows familiar genre patterns without sufficient transformation through lived detail.</comment>
