<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elric's transformation from enforced silence to finding voice carries genuine weight, with his internal conflict between contract and conscience playing out through concrete actions. The moment where his footsteps echo "for the first time" effectively embodies change. Minor deduction for Lady Veyra's somewhat stock fury and the slightly abstract framing of motivation early on.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elric's choice to speak, with visible cost in breaking the fortress's foundational pact. The causal chain from neglected bolt to Lady Veyra's scream to Elric's revelation works cleanly. Deduction for the somewhat convenient yellow stain epiphany that feels slightly forced as a turning mechanism.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress functions as more than backdrop—its "frozen mercury" walls and the specific geography of the spiral staircase constrain and enable choices. The piano bench bolt as micro-setting effectively focuses the conflict. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors ("walls seemed to dim") that could be more precisely rendered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding safety's true cost—escalates from abstract philosophy to concrete crisis when Lady Veyra arrives. Elric's agency drives the resolution through his choice to speak and fix the bolt. The cost is visible in the broken silence and altered fortress dynamic, though the transformation feels slightly too neat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically through the contrast between silence-as-safety and voice-as-courage, with the piano bench bolt serving as effective metaphor for small acts that hold weight. The final image of the child playing imperfect notes while the fortress "hummed with approval" resonantly reweights the opening's "unpardonable silence." Slight deduction for the explicit thematic statement "Safety is not the absence of sound."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent fairy-tale register with controlled elevation ("shadow's breath," "seraphically mundane"). POV control is stable throughout with appropriate access to Elric's interiority. Deduction for occasional overwriting ("cobalt-infused salves and whispered hymns") and the somewhat artificial precision of descriptions like "the third night of the new moon."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is good, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for redundant phrasing ("silence was not a virtue but a contract" followed immediately by similar restatement), occasional purple patches, and the template-like "Days later" transition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of a "silent-choir bellhop" in a healing fortress offers a fresh angle, and the transformation of silence from virtue to liability shows genuine insight. The specific detail of the piano bench bolt as recurring maintenance task that becomes pivotal is inventive. Deduction for somewhat predictable arc and the convenience of the yellow stain revelation.</comment>
