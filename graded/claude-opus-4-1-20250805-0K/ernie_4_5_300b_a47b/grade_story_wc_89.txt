<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's internal conflict between clinging to humanity and becoming something else operates simultaneously throughout, with embodied details like skin prickling "as if thousands of insects crawled beneath it." The metamorphosis choice is earned through accumulated pressure, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("the weight of that purpose made her throat tighten").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through creature offerings and spice-paste ritual, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira becomes "a bridge, a conduit, a keeper of secrets" with the cost of lost humanity. The fortune cookie's prophecy provides causal throughline, and the transformation lands with visible physical and existential cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The moonthorn tree's dual nature (cure/madness), phoenix ashes as "dormant hearts," and spice-paste as "second layer of flesh" all constrain choices and charge the final transformation. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lira's beast-whisperer priorities, and the orchard's permanent moonlight creates coherent magical pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from reluctance through creature offerings to physical transformation, with each element (fox feather, obsidian shard, willow-whispers) tightening pressure toward metamorphosis. The cost—losing human form to maintain the phoenix bond—is explicit, though agency wavers slightly when she "let the spice-scent carry her."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The fortune's "greatest metamorphosis begins with a step you fear" gains layered meaning as physical transformation becomes spiritual bridge-building. Theme emerges through concrete particulars (spice-paste ritual, creature offerings) rather than abstraction, though the final paragraph edges toward explicit thematic summary ("metamorphosis is not an ending, but a rebirth").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through beast-whisperer lens ("the orchard's creatures had taught her this"), with controlled psychic distance shifts during transformation. Some register elevation during peak moments ("cosmic intimacy," "tidal wave") slightly strains the established voice, and occasional filter phrases ("she knew the bird heard") dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong image density and varied rhythm, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("to shed the old self was not to lose it, but to honor it" restates the final line's concept). Mixed metaphor coherence issue with "noose" for fortune paper that actually liberates. Template cadence in creature offering sequence ("The fox emerged...The owl followed...").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of beast-whispering, phoenix rebirth, and human transformation through scent-based magic offers fresh specificity. The fortune cookie in a fairy-tale setting provides unexpected juxtaposition, though the metamorphosis resolution follows somewhat predictable arc once established.</comment>
