I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inferred: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered imagery and reflection toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara understands the covenant's weight lies in present preservation acts.

<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in family legacy, with concrete embodied moments like "fingers tracing the edges" and "brushing sand from her knees." However, the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene - her doubts about the photo remain abstract rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara realizes the covenant's weight exists in present acts of preservation. The accumulative structure coheres through returning images (locket, ink, flowers). However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral - we understand but don't fully feel what Elara sacrifices or risks in this moment of understanding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains and enables choices - the jetty's transformation from "graveyard of shipwrecks" to blooming with "nightshade and moonflowers" mirrors the covenant's renewal. The walnut ink, locket placement in driftwood, and flowers that "glow faintly" and close "as if in prayer" all participate in the final meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through density increase as Elara moves from documenting to actively steeping the photo in ink. The dominant stake (preserving the covenant through small acts) tightens when she realizes her great-grandmother "vanished" after the renewal, suggesting real cost. But the escalation lacks a decisive moment where options narrow palpably.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of "proximate causes" - small acts rippling into eternity. The final image of Elara as "walnut-ink archivist" steeping moments "one small moment at a time" offers a non-literal answer to how traditions survive. The photo's humanity enriches this without becoming heavy-handed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with purposeful compression and lyric touches like "the horizon a bruise of violets and gold." The perceptual signature shows in selective details - an archivist notices edges, frames, preservation methods. Some filter verbs ("she wondered," "she thought") slightly dull immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("flowers closing as if in prayer") with good rhythm variation. Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor redundancies appear in the reflection passages ("The covenant would hold, she thought" follows similar earlier assertions), and some abstract phrasing ("haunted euphoria") could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of archival work with magical covenant renewal offers a fresh angle on tradition preservation. The specific detail of walnut ink as preservation medium and the jetty's transformation from shipwreck site to blooming ground show originality. The piece commits to its quiet, accumulative approach without retreating to conventional plot beats.</comment>
