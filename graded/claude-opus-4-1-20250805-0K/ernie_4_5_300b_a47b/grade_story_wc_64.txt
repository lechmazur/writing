I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through discovery and pattern recognition, with the tapestry's threads accumulating meaning toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "discover the shape of intentions" drives consistent action through the tapestry decoding. Her transformation from "blithe gardener" to "gardener of time itself" shows earned change, though internal contradiction could be more embodied during the discovery process.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara reframes her role from tending graves to tending time, with the cost being the weight of knowledge she now carries. The accumulative pattern holds as threads reveal meaning, though the conceptual leap to "gardener of time" feels slightly unearned by the specific discoveries.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt silo setting constrains and enables the discovery - its "velveteen gloom" and oculus providing both atmosphere and the constellation reference point. Sensory details like "fingers calloused from decades" and the tactile tapestry work ground the fantastical elements effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation as each thread reveals deeper meaning - from stars to chess knight to the phrase about silence. The dominant stake of understanding the dead's intentions tightens, though the final revelation lacks a sharper cost or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of untangling threads to understand intentions across time. The phrase "The silence between moves" resonates as both chess reference and metaphor for death, avoiding explicit moralizing while offering complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with phrases like "velveteen gloom" and "uncharted echoes." POV remains stable with Elara's perspective filtering all observations, though some passages drift toward elevated diction that slightly exceeds her gardener persona.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("rose like a skeletal finger against the night sky") but suffers from occasional overwriting and register drift. Some metaphors strain ("dance of intentions played out across time") and the phrase "uncharted echoes" appears without clear grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of a cemetery gardener discovering a time-map tapestry offers originality, though the execution relies on familiar mystical discovery tropes. The specific synthesis of chess, constellations, and burial rites creates some freshness but doesn't fully transform the archaeological mystery template.</comment>
