I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered memories accessed via coffee rings, with density increasing toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara accepts her scars as stories rather than wounds.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to decode her mother's death is clear and embodied through the scar's physical aching. The telepathic plant connection feels ornamental rather than character-essential. Her transformation from seeking closure to finding "the ability to read stories in scars" lands but arrives through convenient visions rather than earned struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure through coffee-ring portals coheres, building to Mara's acceptance of scars as bridges. However, the resolution feels unearned—she simply touches the hourglass and receives enlightenment. The cost (carrying scars with pride) is declared rather than demonstrated through difficult choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The tower setting with its damp stone and frosted hourglass creates atmosphere, but the coffee-ring tunnel feels disconnected from the established reality. Setting doesn't meaningfully constrain choices—Mara simply moves through portals observing. The space functions more as backdrop than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract—"seeking closure" and "untangling threads" never face concrete tests. The visions show past events but don't force Mara to choose or sacrifice. The hourglass shattering happens to her rather than through her agency, undermining earned escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The scars-as-stories metaphor emerges clearly, especially through the mother's teaching "Stories are written in scars." However, the theme arrives through direct statement ("The scars weren't just maps of loss; they were bridges to understanding") rather than dramatized realization. The ending's "displaced miracle" connection feels forced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with moments like "meteor hush" and "the tunnel twisted." However, the plant whispers (*They know*, *Follow the rings*) feel artificially inserted. POV remains stable but lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond poetic description.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: "displaced miracle trapped between moments," "jagged line from collarbone to ribcage," "stagnant water." Template phrasing appears: "She'd come seeking...but," "She'd always believed...but." The final paragraph explicitly moralizes ("She'd come seeking closure, but she'd found something better") rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The coffee-ring memory portals offer mild originality, though the execution feels mechanical. The core concept of reading scars as stories isn't particularly fresh. The story follows a predictable healing arc without surprising turns or genuine risk-taking.</comment>
