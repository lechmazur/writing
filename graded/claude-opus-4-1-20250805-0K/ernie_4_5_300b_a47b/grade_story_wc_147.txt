<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "harness the ephemeral" drives credible choices under pressure, with internal conflict between smashing the vial vs. patience showing contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to release rather than trap the memories earns its reversal through prior causality. Loses points for some therapy-speak ("collective grief") and the abstract phrasing of "lonesome splendor of release."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory detail (lavender/saltwater scent) triggers memory cascade that reweights understanding, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara releases rather than harnesses. Cost is visible: the priests' terror/regret and Mara covering her ears from overwhelming voices. The orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words (underwater temple, diving suit, distress signal context).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater temple constrains choices through its physical architecture (crumbling archway, fissure requiring squeeze-through) and sensory environment affects perception. The vial's scent mechanism and the "gathered hush" as tangible presence shape Mara's tactics. Strong spatial choreography tracks her descent through specific obstacles to the circular chamber.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation follows accumulative pattern: vial resistance → scent release → memory surge → descent through fissure → symbol activation → hush unsnarling. The storm above creates time pressure that forces action. Cost lands when the thousand voices pierce "her suit, her bones, her soul" and she must override instinct to flee.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the temple's purpose as memory vault becoming prison, with the final insight that "some things are meant to be unsnarled, not held." The vial transforms from key to release mechanism. The ending reweights "harnessing the ephemeral" to mean letting go rather than capturing, though some abstract phrasing ("lonesome splendor") weakens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains underwater/archaeological register with selective perception focused on temple details and sensory cues. Some register drift into elevated diction ("lonesome splendor," "ephemeral") that doesn't fully match Mara's practical diver persona. Clean POV control throughout with no head-hopping, though occasional filter verbs ("She needed to unsnarl") reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, but several abstract phrases weaken precision: "lonesome splendor," "harnessing the ephemeral," "collective grief." Some redundancy in explaining the temple's purpose twice. The metaphor "whispers coiled like eels" works well, but "mirror" for the hush feels less grounded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The underwater temple as memory vault offers a fresh angle on ruins exploration, with the scent-triggered memory mechanism providing specificity. The reversal from harness to release feels earned. However, the abstract framing of "ephemeral" and "lonesome splendor" reads somewhat template-like rather than fully original.</comment>
