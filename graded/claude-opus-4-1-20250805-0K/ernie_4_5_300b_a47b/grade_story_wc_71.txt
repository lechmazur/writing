I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to understand "alive" houses drives consistent action, and her methodical arrangement of objects reveals character through specific choices. However, the internal experience lacks contradictory impulses during the ritual—she proceeds with certainty rather than doubt, reducing complexity. The "creeping normality noticer" trait manifests through concrete observations but doesn't generate internal conflict or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Lira arranging objects to test her theory, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the bay becomes sanctified. However, the cost remains abstract—we see golden light and "listening" houses but no concrete price paid or path foreclosed. The transformation lacks visible stakes or trade-offs that would elevate the closure beyond atmospheric success.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bay setting anchors early and effectively, with specific details like "streetlights daydreamed in their amber haze" creating atmosphere. The displaced objects (rusted key, porcelain doll's arm, glass marble) provide tactile specificity that grounds the magical realism. Setting actively shapes the ritual through the bay's amplifying properties, though the houses' transformation remains visually vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—gets established but never faces genuine opposition or complication. The ritual proceeds without obstacle, reversal, or meaningful choice under pressure. While the accumulative arrangement builds toward the sanctification moment, there's no tightening of options or forced trade-off that would create dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of noticing the unnoticed emerges through concrete action, with displaced objects serving as bridges "between the mundane and the ineffable." The concept of "inadvertently profound" things resonates through specific examples. However, the ending's sanctification feels predetermined rather than discovered, and the thematic exploration lacks complexity or counter-pressure that would deepen meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency with selective perception—Lira notices "half an inch" leans and mismatched rhythms. Phrases like "While the streetlights daydreamed" show controlled lyricism. However, some passages drift into explanatory register ("Items that didn't belong, yet fit perfectly") that weakens immediacy, and filter constructions ("she thought," "she wondered") accumulate without adding texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of precision ("veined stone," "soil turned after rain") but suffers from paraphrase loops, particularly in paragraphs 3-4 where the concept of displaced objects gets restated without advancement. Template constructions like "She'd [verb]" appear repeatedly. The closing image of nodding porch lights and twitching curtains feels stock rather than earned through specific detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept of a "creeping normality noticer" who sanctifies space through displaced objects offers originality. The orris root's perfumery function as "fixing" silence shows creative synthesis. However, the execution relies on familiar magical realism tropes (glowing objects, animated houses) without sufficient transformation, and the resolution's ease undermines the premise's potential complexity.</comment>
