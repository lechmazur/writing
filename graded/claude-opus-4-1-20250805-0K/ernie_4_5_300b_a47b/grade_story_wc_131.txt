<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation crystallizes clearly from passive survival to active guardian role, with embodied details like "fingers calloused from years" and concrete choices in revealing the cache. The transformation from invisibility to messenger lands with earned weight. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("for the first time, she felt seen") rather than pure embodiment in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: tape discovery → sense memory → decoder search → message revelation → guardian transformation, with visible cost in Mara choosing visibility over safety. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost. Deduction for slight ambiguity in the tape's origin story and the convenient decoder discovery, though the emotional arc compensates.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crawl spaces and pipe chases function as constraining micro-settings that shape Mara's choices and abilities throughout. Vivid sensory work: "walls slick with condensation," "metallic scent of old paper." The library's architecture directly enables the discovery and frames Mara's transformed role. Slight deduction for some generic descriptors in the opening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity about the tape to discovering a larger purpose for vulnerable library patrons. The sense memory intensifies appropriately, forcing Mara's choice between safety and revelation. Cost is visible but somewhat abstract—the risk of visibility is stated more than dramatized through immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of visibility/invisibility emerges organically through Mara's transformation from hidden survivor to guardian-messenger. The tape's message reweights her isolation as purposeful rather than mere survival. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit thematic statement "she was no longer invisible" rather than letting the image alone carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with Mara's methodical, spatial intelligence evident in how she navigates and maps spaces. Voice maintains consistency through technical precision ("ferromagnetic," "pipe chases"). Dialogue from the tape reads authentically urgent. Minor deduction for some filter-heavy passages ("she could see," "she heard").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid moments like "dawn crept through...staining the air a sapphire hush." Some repetitive structures ("She'd found," "She'd mapped," "She'd dismissed") and occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages. The ending risks slight redundancy with both "felt seen" and "become visible" hitting similar notes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle on the hidden-people trope through the specific crawl space dwelling and library setting. The sense memory device offers an original way to bridge past and present. The transformation from solitary survivor to community guardian provides genuine emotional complexity beyond surface novelty.</comment>
