I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, focusing on immediate publishability in elite venues.

<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lumin's motivation is clear and rooted in generational trauma, with concrete embodied details like trembling hands and the gear's hum. The ghost encounter provides earned revelation about fire as language versus violence. However, the internal conflict relies too heavily on exposition about the Enclave's history rather than dramatized struggle, and the epiphany about "quieter light" arrives somewhat abstractly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through petals, pinging, and light imagery that culminates in Lumin's decision to carry forward "a gentler flame." The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—Lumin's understanding shifts from fire-as-destruction to fire-as-whisper. The cost is legible in the abandoned gear and the weight of generational responsibility, though the transformation could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nebula garden setting actively shapes the narrative through sonar pinging that guides Lumin's journey and crystalline trees that pulse with light. Sensory details like "petals drifted like forgotten constellations" and "gas-clouds that shimmered like mother-of-pearl" create atmosphere while the calculating gear's "teeth approximating infinity" provides tactile specificity. The setting constrains choice when Lumin must leave the gear behind to carry the new understanding forward.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconciling the Enclave's rejection of fire with Lumin's belief in healing light—intensifies through the ghost's revelation about violence versus gentleness. The sonar pinging creates urgency and the gear's calculations suggest possibility, building to Lumin's choice. However, the conflict lacks visceral opposition; the ghost provides answers too readily without forcing Lumin to struggle for understanding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between consuming fire and healing light, with generational patterns serving as bridge rather than chain. The final image of the spinning gear "approximating infinity" while serving a "finite purpose" resonates conceptually. The story avoids explicit moralizing, letting the transformation from violence to gentleness emerge through concrete details like scarred hands and bioluminescent alternatives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with phrases like "across the quiet sigh of falling petals" and perceptual signature in how Lumin experiences the garden's frequencies "like a second heartbeat." The ghost's dialogue carries appropriate weight with "We burned the world to hear its screams, not its songs." However, some passages drift into elevated abstraction ("a form of light that existed beyond physics") that strains against the intimate POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("petals drifted like forgotten constellations") but suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing around "generational patterns" (appears 4 times). The phrase "approximating infinity" recurs without evolving meaning. Some sentences strain for profundity: "To move forward, they had to carry the past's lessons, not its scars" reads as thesis statement rather than earned insight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of fire as language that can be spoken gently offers fresh perspective on the destruction/creation binary. The calculating gear from a dying star's core and sentient flora using sonar create specific worldbuilding. However, the resolution toward "quieter light" and bridge metaphor for generational patterns feels somewhat expected given the setup, lacking a truly surprising synthesis.</comment>
