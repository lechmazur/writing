<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to confront her mother's guilt is earned through the amber discovery and personal backstory revelation, with genuine internal conflict visible when she trembles before entering the firmware. The cost of confronting childhood trauma lands clearly. However, Elara functions more as exposition vehicle than pressure source, and some emotional beats rely on abstraction ("guilt etched into her bones") rather than embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira's forgiveness rewrites the firmware, dissolving guilt into understanding with clear emotional cost. The causal chain from amber discovery to firmware entry to resolution holds. However, the mechanics of "entering firmware's memory" strain credibility without sufficient grounding, and the revelation that Dr. Althea Voss is Lira's mother feels convenient rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The laboratory setting with "walls hummed with forgotten frequencies" and "air tasted of ozone and regret" creates distinctive atmosphere that supports the haunted technology premise. The amber functions as micro-setting that constrains choice. However, spatial choreography during the firmware entry sequence becomes abstract, and the nursery materializes without clear anchoring to the established world rules.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—confronting the scientists' guilt to prevent dissonance consuming everyone—is established early and escalates when Lira must face her mother's specific guilt. The personal cost of confronting childhood abandonment charges the final forgiveness. However, the threat of "dissonance will consume us all" remains abstract without concrete demonstration of what consumption means.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of transforming guilt into forgiveness emerges organically through Lira's journey from mapping stars to escape her past to actively confronting it. The mother's letter creates genuine resonance: "I left because I loved you too much to let the world hurt you." However, the firmware-as-guilt metaphor occasionally becomes too explicit, particularly in Elara's exposition about "scientists who encoded their guilt."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency with distinctive touches like "her needle a silver quill against the canvas of flesh" and controlled psychic distance. However, Elara's dialogue tends toward exposition ("The firmware's haunted by the scientists who encoded their guilt into it"), and the shift into the digital labyrinth lacks sufficient perceptual grounding to maintain POV integrity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Strong opening establishes voice and atmosphere efficiently: "In the laboratory of lost sounds, where the walls hummed with forgotten frequencies." Information density is generally good with lines doing multiple jobs. However, abstract phrases like "Time's folding in on itself" and "guilt etched into her bones" reduce specificity, and some exposition-heavy dialogue creates momentum drag in the middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The fusion of constellation tattooing with haunted firmware creates an unexpected synthesis, and the specific detail of firmware translating baby cries into silence offers genuine originality. The emotional specificity of a mother's abandonment letter found in antique furniture elevates beyond generic guilt. However, the digital labyrinth sequence relies on familiar virtual reality tropes without sufficient transformation.</comment>
