I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered observations of dust, decay, and transformation patterns, with density increase and cadence shift reweighting Elara's understanding.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from cosmic researcher to student of terrestrial decay is earned through concrete micro-choices and embodied details. The contradiction between her need for control and acceptance of unpredictability acts throughout, particularly in "Decay isn't an event... it's a language." Minor deduction for some intellectual distance in emotional beats that could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's evolved perspective ("Your dust patterns—they're like tree rings") demonstrates genuine transformation with professional cost (colleagues' confusion). The accumulative lens holds consistently through dust pattern observations building to paradigm shift. Slight weakness in cost legibility - the professional stakes could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as both setting and metaphor, constraining Elara's methods and forcing adaptation ("particle counter, spectrometer... equations that no longer mapped"). Sensory details like "lenses fogged from lingering humidity" and "silt-clogged drains" create lived-in specificity. The chrysalis in the drainage pipe exemplifies how environment shapes discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation through accumulative pressure works well - from examining debris to discovering the chrysalis to presenting findings. The dominant stake (understanding decay as language vs. event) deepens through concrete discoveries. Cost becomes visible in professional isolation, though the personal price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through Elara's shift from "reducing celestial phenomena to numbers" to embracing unpredictability. The butterfly dust as "microcosm of the ecosystem" and the chrysalis spiral pattern offer non-literal answers about survival and adaptation. Final image of collaboration with botanist resonantly reweights the journey without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with scientific precision filtering perception ("waveform of a dying pulsar," "accretion disks"). Voice modulates effectively between technical observation and wonder. Some register elevation in places like "raw, unfiltered process" slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good information density, particularly in descriptions linking cosmic and terrestrial phenomena. Some paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("Gradual change... but never predictable" restates earlier material). Minor filter-verb accumulation ("she found herself," "she'd begun") dulls immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics and ecological decay creates genuine originality. The specific angle of a neutron star researcher finding humility in butterfly dust patterns transforms familiar post-disaster narrative. The spiral pattern discovery and cross-disciplinary connection at the end feel earned and non-obvious.</comment>
