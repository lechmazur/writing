I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and grounded in her role as soul collector, with concrete embodiment through physical details like clutching the crocodile's tooth. The spectral figure provides meaningful pressure that forces Lira to confront her fear that "laughter is not enough," earning the final realization about healing as pursuit. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional beats ("luminous ache of hope").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with proper closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Lira's understanding of healing transforms from seeking laughter to embracing the journey itself. The crocodile's tooth shifts from veil-piercing tool to "symbol of resilience," with visible cost in acknowledging truth's bite. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words, though the spectral encounter could tighten causally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Echo Gorge functions beyond backdrop—its "stone ribs" pressing close and pebbles humming with ghosts create atmospheric pressure. The crocodile's tooth constrains choice as Lira's only tool, charging the final image when it "pulsed with faint light." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though some descriptions edge toward the ornamental ("sky bled gold").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—integrating laughter into healing—faces meaningful deepening when the spectral figure challenges Lira's assumption, forcing her to confront deeper truth. The cost registers in her admission of fear and acceptance that healing requires enduring pain. However, the resolution feels slightly too neat; the spectral figure's disappearance and immediate warmth lack the friction expected at this moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the crocodile's tooth metaphor—"it bites, but it also holds the key to release"—avoiding explicit moralizing. The final insight that healing is "a journey through distortion and doubt" reweights earlier material without stating a thesis. Strong subtext in the spectral dialogue, though the final paragraph edges toward summary with "she realized."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled lyrical register appropriate to the mystical subject matter. The spectral figure's "chorus of whispers" differentiates it from Lira's grounded perspective. Perceptual signature evident in how Lira notices spectral details through her collector's lens. Minor filter verb accumulation ("she heard," "she understood") slightly dulls immediacy in middle beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic variety and atmospheric density, with effective shorter sentences during tension ("Lira hesitated"). Information density is generally high, though some passages contain mild redundancy ("modestly fearless, a quiet resolve"). The "luminous ache" phrase works but edges toward purple prose. Clean grammar and punctuation throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The soul collector premise offers a fresh angle on afterlife narratives, particularly the concept of weaving spectral confessions into healing threads. The crocodile's tooth as both literal tool and metaphor for painful truth shows originality. However, the resolution—healing as journey rather than destination—while well-executed, doesn't fully transform the familiar wisdom.</comment>
