<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's grief-driven motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like bleeding fingers and the pendant worn close to heart. The internal conflict between atonement and renewal plays out through specific actions rather than abstractions. However, the transformation from "hollowed shadow" to steady hands feels slightly rushed without sufficient intermediate struggle, and some emotional transitions rely on telling ("subdued thrill") rather than embodied showing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's shift from isolated grief to creating a "language" for collective healing, with visible cost in his bleeding fingers and emotional exhaustion. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer (stencil→lanterns→origami→shadows) to reweight grief as transformative rather than destructive. However, the causality between discovering the stencil and inventing the ritual feels underdeveloped, and the final inscription appearing in his wife's handwriting breaks established reality without proper setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The observatory setting actively constrains and enables choices—its dome's etched constellations align with the stencil pattern, its dormant lanterns must be activated for the ritual. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (mercury-pooled time, dust-sliced light beams). The coordinates represent specific wounded places that mirror internal grief geography. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("time pooled like mercury") that doesn't fully ground the physical space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming grief into renewal—maintains coherence but lacks significant tightening or reversal. The discovery that shadows become "invitations" provides a deepening moment, yet this arrives without sufficient pressure or trade-off. The cost (bleeding fingers, emotional exhaustion) feels proportionate but doesn't force a meaningful choice between competing goods. Agency manifests primarily through endurance rather than decisive action under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of "mending what cannot be unbroken" emerges organically through concrete actions and the central metaphor of light refraction. The curtains of intention work as both literal projections and metaphorical bridges between despair and renewal. However, some thematic statements edge toward explicit moralizing ("grief, like light, could be refracted"), and the final inscription provides too neat a summary rather than letting the image resonate alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The voice maintains a lyrical, contemplative register appropriate to the mourning jewelry maker's perspective, with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature shows in selective attention to light, shadow, and craftsmanship details. However, some passages drift into elevated literary diction ("ardor," "atonement") that feels slightly removed from embodied character experience, and the prose occasionally tells emotional states rather than rendering them through perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("rings of meteorite iron, pendants holding vials of stardust") with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is generally good with lines doing multiple jobs. However, several abstract metaphors lack concrete grounding ("time pooled like mercury"), and there's noticeable repetition of conceptual phrasing around grief/renewal that borders on loops. Some filter constructions ("He realized," "Elias imagined") dull immediacy in key moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of mourning jewelry craft with astronomical imagery and origami creates a fresh angle on grief narratives. The "curtains of intention" concept and the shadows-as-invitations discovery show genuine inventiveness. The specific coordinates of wounded places add particularity. However, the grief-to-renewal arc follows a somewhat predictable trajectory, and the magical realism element (wife's handwriting appearing) feels unearned rather than boldly committed to its premise.</comment>
